state_press_2023_11,"Conservative commentators Charlie Kirk and Dennis Prager speak at the event “Health, Wealth & Happiness 2.0” at the Katzin Concert Hall on Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2023 on the Tempe Campus. A well-known conservative provocateur took the stage on February 8 atGammageto thunderous applause. As he grabbed the microphone, Charlie Kirk looked every bit the young, charismatic leader of America’s populist right-wing movement, with a winning smile and disarming manner that instantly inspired confidence. He then calledBarrett, the Honors Collegeprofessors, intellectual midgets and cowards– moments of hostility that kicked off the absurdly childish “Health, Wealth and Happiness” saga, which has ironically undermined their free speech advocacy. In February, the Barrett faculty signed a letter voicing their disagreement with the T.W. Lewis Center s decision to include Kirk and Dennis Prager in the Barrett-sponsored “Health, Wealth and Happiness” event. The letter stated that the 37 professors were not involved with the decision to invite Kirk and Prager and distanced themselves from those viewpoints, as they “do not reflect the commitment to critical thinking central to Barrett’s education mission.” Nowhere in the letter did faculty members call for the event’s cancellation. They only objected to Barrett headlining an event with Kirk and Prager. Yet somehow, Kirk seized this opportunity to skew the facts. In February, Kirk condemned the Barrett faculty for their “censorship.” A week ago, he called for ASU’s defunding in frustration. At this point, Kirk’s discussion is less about free speech and more about using it as an excuse to condemn those who disagree with his viewpoints. Since February, theT.W. Lewis Center was dissolvedbecause Tom Lewis himself decided to pull the funding, and the Arizona legislature launched aninvestigationinto whether or not ASU censored Kirk and Prager. The internal probe found no evidence of censorship, and both speakers returned to campus on Wednesday, Sept. 27, at the“Health, Wealth and Happiness 2.0”event with guns blazing. “The 37 professors are intellectual lightweights,” Prager said at the event. “I have invited your despicable professors here who wrote that despicable thing about us to come on my show. They won’t debate us. They will only smear. These are truly empty, bad people.” Kirk agreed with those statements, saying he considers ASU a “Stalinist enterprise.” Of course, Kirk and Prager have the constitutional right to criticize a public university with contempt dripping from every syllable. The First Amendment protects it. The problem is that Prager and Kirk malign free speech if it contradicts their positions. Their “right” to promote their messages supersedes the Barrett faculty’s right to express dissent. To them, dissent is the censorship. They have no shame in using low-level tactics to intimidate their opponents. Kirk prattled that free speech isn’t free speech if it’s punished. Yet, he had no philosophical reservations in letting his followers harass the 37 Barrett faculty members with threats of violence. He has no shame in endangering their safety by putting their contact information on a “Professor Watchlist” so invasive that even President Crow spoke out against it, which landed him on the same watchlist. However, ASU students disagree with what Kirk and Prager claim. According to data from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE , a nonprofit that assesses free speech on college campuses, 81% of ASU students say that it is somewhat to very clear that ASU supports free speech, and 74% say that if a controversial speaker were invited, ASU would defend the speaker s right to express those viewpoints. Combined with the Legislature s findings that exonerate ASU from censorship, it s clear that free speech is safe at the University, contrary to what two provocateurs opine. Free speech can be complicated in a country that protects it more than anywhere else. But throughout the “Health, Wealth and Happiness” saga this year, Kirk and Prager have demonstrated that they aren’t true advocates for disseminating ideas if they don’t conform to their own. Both provocateurs would rather harass and ridicule their opponents than accurately represent their stances. Kirk prefers defunding ASU over accepting that some people might question his ideas. Prager would rather attack professors’ characters than engage in good-faith debate. Caught up in ideological messaging, Kirk and Prager entirely miss their point about free speech: that it’s for everyone, even those you hate. Edited by Shane Brennan, Walker Smith, Angelina Steel.

rice_thresher_2023_65,"ByBradley Ramsey1/31/23 10:53pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer is a form of artificial intelligence technology that has been growing in popularity amongst students, especially those in academia. Rice University has seen a recent surge in students utilizing ChatGPT to help them in their coursework, raising questions about its usefulness and appropriate usage. The popularity of GPT as a tool for completing assignments has grown due to its capability to generate high-quality, persuasive writing. It assists students in quickly producing academically sound papers at a much faster rate than if they were to complete the project on their own. GPT can also be used to effectively research topics and generate quality citations. As such, ChatGPT has become an attractive choice for students at Rice University who are short on time and need to quickly finish an assignment. Yet, there is also the potential for abuse of this technology, as some students could potentially use it for plagiarism or for submitting papers that are not their own work. As such, it is important for Rice University to consider how it can respond in order to maintain academic integrity. One response to this dilemma could be for the university to require students to disclose their usage of GPT when submitting assignments. This would allow the university to keep track of the use of GPT and easily recognize if a student is relying on it too heavily. However, such a policy could dissuade some students from using GPT and lead to a less efficient use of the technology. Another potential response is for the university to develop a system to detect and flag any suspicious use of GPT. This could be done by creating a system that detects any potential signs of plagiarism or unoriginal work, such as particular phrases or language patterns. While this could be effective in identifying students who are attempting to abuse the use of GPT, it could also unfairly penalize students who are simply utilizing it to its full potential. In the end, Rice University must come up with a feasible solution that prioritizes both academic integrity and students’ learning. To this end, the university should consider developing a well-defined policy that outlines the proper usage of GPT and making sure to provide adequate resources to help students in understanding and appropriately using the technology. Ultimately, the challenge for Rice University lies in finding the right balance between preserving its academic standards and allowing students the opportunity to benefit from the use of GPT. With the right approach and resources, the university should be able to develop an effective response that takes into account the needs of both students and faculty. With the seemingly distant future approaching faster and faster everyday, students, staff and the Rice administration must keep pace. It may surprise some readers to discover that this entire article besides these final two paragraphs was created with the GPT-3 AI by the company OpenAI. The entire article was written using the simple prompt, “Write an article debating the usage of chat gpt by students at rice university for classes, and how the university should respond to the usage of chat gpt.” This is a powerful example of how this type of AI can be used inside and outside of the classroom. I am by no means a coder, and within a few minutes of trying prompts I could create an entire article. In fact, after using the AI to complete this article, I made two separate cover letters using it. With all this being said, this is a growing technology, much like the early days of Google, and just as universities adapted to Google, they will need to adapt to AI. The question everyone at Rice must ask is what will that adaptation look like? April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2023_85,"The scientific method: hypothesis, experiment, and conclusion. This is how I understood science at a Texas high school; this is also a notion that most people, disillusioned with the motions of the scientific method, leave high school with. I myself chose the humanities. But the notion that we must associate science with a strict adherence to method and materialism limited what I thought I could contribute to the scientific process. Children see the material universe as the ancients perceived before their imagination is restrained: lacking fundamental facts and methodical rules, with no prior scientific foundation to stand upon. Without predecessors and modern instruments, how did the ancients once frame the material universe? I turn to the Romantic poet, William Blake, to describe the child’s imagination in a series of poems titled “Songs of Innocence and Experience.” Blake’s poems represent innocence as youth and naivety; experience as mature and rational. The opposition between imagination and materialism resembles the irreconcilable nature of innocence and experience. Blake wrote in reaction to the rise of Francis Bacon’s, Sir Isaac Newton’s, and John Milton’s emphasis on materialism. Blake viewed their emphasis on materialism and exclusion of imagination as the creation of a “false deity” of Enlightenment scientific realism, which limits our vision and understanding of the material universe. Such a perspective disavowed our access inward to what Blake elucidates as“Worlds of Thought”— the imagination — limiting us to sense perception. Without a full science education to teach how imagination and materialism have complemented each other in Aristotle’s to Einstein’s theories, I fear the end of scientific progress and echo Blake’s ultimate concern about the destruction of existence. Do we turn less and less inward as more is discovered? High school nurtured the intuition that there was no step, if science can be reduced to steps, to be imaginative. I prepared before each lab under the guidance of a laminated scientific method poster, sliced scientific fact from a textbook to stitch into my hypothesis, and recorded data into tables and models to affirm the textbook in my conclusion. Behind the fascination of each marvel outside the classroom was a calculable conclusion. I wondered how the scientific discoveries of Nicolaus Copernicus’ heliocentrism and Friedrich Miescher’s identification of “nuclein,” or DNA, were possible without the essential elements of imagination and surprise. How do we progress without imagination to complement materialism? I thought access to “Worlds of Thought” were exclusive to the humanities. It often feels as though the main prerequisite for humanities, as a subjective discipline, is experience and imagination, whereas that of science, as an objective discipline, is an intensive understanding of fact. Why is the imagination not associated with science education more often? I became disillusioned with science. I chose the route of humanities because the worlds within had high potential to provide insight on the one I inhabit. I see a friend’s exhaustion from a p-set, their mind overwhelmed and fried. How does science seem to vacuum the imagination from their eyes? The narrator of Walt Whitman’s“When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer”expresses their tiredness of “proofs, figures ... charts and diagrams.” What more can the imagination — beyond facts and models — comprehend about our universe? The narrator wanders outside of the astronomer’s lecture into an immersion of night air, captivated by the mysticism of the universe’s appearance of infinite stars and coordinates. The narrator turns away from modern science. In Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein,” Professor Krempe reproaches Victor Frankenstein’s interest in the imaginative theories of the ancient Agrippa and Paracelsus; their theories represent “exploded systems” and “fancies” that modern science falsifies. Indeed, the ancients’ theories cannot withstand modern science; but the professor’s exclusion of their theories as “sad trash” dismisses imagination as a relic, obsolete to modern science without credit to the discoveries made possible due to their theories. Victor turns away from the demands of modern science. I do not foresee a Nobel surfacing in a high school lab. But I resonate with Walt’s narrator and Victor’s wishes. I wish authorities in education were equally invested in the individual’s intuition, emboldening peers and me to wonder with what is known and largely unknown about our material universe. To be pro-imagination is conflated to be anti-science, but this contradiction inhibits the harmonious and irreconcilable nature of imagination and materialism. Progress in science is thought to be the slow retirement of the imagination. But science needs the imagination to see within and outside our reliance on scientific fact. The ancients’ imaginative theories assisted in their successor’s wonder and addition to impermanent systems. With this perspective, I plan to enroll in more science courses. If progress depends on imagination and materialism, science education should embolden the intuition and potential of each to see within “Worlds of Thought” to collaborate and contribute to knowledge.

state_press_2023_46,"ASU redshirt senior guard Luther Muhammad (1 passing a USC defender at Desert Financial Arena on January 21, 2023. USC beat ASU 77-69. ASU men s basketball is in the midst of potentially its best season ever. Whether that happens, though, will depend on how Bobby Hurley s squad finishes. If the start of their season is any indication, we could be watching a historic run for the Sun Devils. The kind ofhistorythe team is aiming for was last seen in 1994-1995. That s the last time the ASU men s basketball team finished a season with single-digit losses. Unsurprisingly, that is also the last time the team went to the NCAA men s basketball tournament Sweet 16. Since then, ASU has made the NCAA men s basketball tournament five times and has never made it past the second round. That may seem surprising, given that the team featured James Harden from 2007-2009, but the hard truth is that ASU men s basketball has usually been … all right. They haven t been stellar, they haven t been March Madness stars and, dare I say, they ve fallen well short of where thatteam in Tucsonhas been in terms of men s basketball quality. So, the question arises: What makes this team unique? Why, out of all seasons, is the current Sun Devil team rising to the challenge? Why are they playing at the level of teams such as UCLA, USC and UA? First and foremost, the quality of the individual players and how they play as a team cannot be emphasized enough. ASU has four players averaging over 10 points per game, and they are led in scoring by Desmond Cambridge Jr., whose brother, Devan Cambridge, also scores at a voracious clip. The Cambridges are complemented by DJ Horne, Frankie Collins and Warren Washington. Washington has been a defensive star in anexcellent overall defensefor the Sun Devils, averaging two blocks per game. Perhaps even more crucially, the squad has depth. Austin Nunez offers great scoring off the bench, including 10 pointsagainst UCLAlast Thursday night. All of that talent, coached and developed by Hurley, is what has separated this Sun Devil team from past groups that have failed to play at this level. Yet, some fans may remain skeptical. This is a Sun Devil team, after all, that couldn t get the job done at home against the Bruins, Wildcats and Trojans. Why should we believe that they will be able to beat a high-caliber team in an intense postseason tournament? That is a fair point. ASU won t play the top Pac-12 teams at home again. When it plays those teams in a hostile or neutral environment, it will be a mental battle to stay in the game. However, this is a team that has improved since the season started. Early in the season, it would ve been hard to convince any ASU fan that the team would be up on UCLA at halftime after losing to a now 6-14 Texas Southern team. Before ASU faces thePac-12 s best teams again, it has time to sharpen its game. Hurley will need to make adjustments through a stretch of games between now and an end-of-season road trip to UA, UCLA and USC. If Hurley can get his team focused, it s not hard to imagine ASU winning one or two of those games and making a run in the conference tournament before playing in March. And then? Watch out, because this team has a very good shot to reach the Sweet 16. ASU men s basketball fans should make their presence known at Desert Financial Arena. They made an impact against UCLA, and they should show up the rest of the season to ensure that the Sun Devils have all the momentum they need going into what could very well be a historic postseason. This could go down as the team s best season yet. So, don t make excuses. Be there for it. Edited by Kate Duffy, Reagan Priest and Luke Chatham.

thetech_mit_2023_13,"Since November, the MIT Police Association has distributed more than 6,000 flyers1 to students and faculty. Standing outside campus interrupting you as you make your way to class is not something we want to do. But unfortunately, it has become our reality. The response from faculty and students has been overwhelming — thank you! However, the school and Chief DiFava continue to show zero respect or support to rank-and-file officers. The 42 officers of the MIT Police Association have been working without a contract since last July. We’ve met 16 times, but the school continues to refuse to address reasonable quality of life and economic issues. At the heart of the negotiation is the question of whether MIT will follow the lead of Harvard and Boston University in mitigating the impact of inflation, acknowledging the extraordinary new burdens imposed on police officers, and ensuring that it will continue to attract and retain officers with the highest quality through providing comparable contract improvements. All we are asking for is a modest raise so we can support our families. In fact, Chief DiFava defended the MIT Police Civilian Dispatchers in the Public PERF Report, calling their jobs demanding and competitive and advocating for better pay. Why hasn’t the Chief publicly supported our request for competitive wages? We are asking him and the school to acknowledge that MIT police officers are valued members of the MIT community. You came to MIT because it’s a well-respected, world-class university, an international leader in academia. Our officers are proud to work at such a well-respected institution. We only wish our police chief and school officials felt the same way about us. Melissa Sullivan, representative of MIT Police Association and former Cambridge resident 1 The association distributed flyers outside campus Nov. 16, Jan. 11 and Feb. 6"
rice_thresher_2023_32,"ByThresher Editorial Board8/29/23 11:40pm With the beginning of a new academic year, the dining options available to students and staff on campus have gotten a small makeover. The Whoo Deli has relocated to the Ley Student Center, while the servery lines have now been separated to make them easier for students to distinguish (Rincon Caliente, Owl Masala, Mediterranean, etc. . While these changes certainly have good intentions and are designed to modernize and simplify the dining process, we believe that they have actually confused students and hampered the accessibility of on-campus dining. First, we believe that Housing and Dining should provide a consistent quantity of food options on weekends. We understand that many students may choose to go off campus for some weekend meals, reducing on-campus demand. However, there are many others who stay on campus for economic reasons, convenience or just to avoid ending the year with hundreds of unused swipes, and these students need and deserve food to eat. Since last school year, the cost of the on-campus meal plan increased by $700 to $5,500 per year, an average of $7.33 per meal. There should be sufficient food for the swipes we have purchased at every meal period, every day of the week. Another weekend concern is the availability of meals for students with dietary restrictions. This weekend, there are no vegetarian options listed on the menus of any servery with a menu, which at time of writing is only North. Vegetarian and vegan students should have the option to eat something other than plain pasta or salads on the weekends. Additionally, the H&D website should be updated and amended to more frequently reflect accurate changes and options available, including vegetarian options. Students, especially those with dietary or religious restrictions, need to quickly know what foods are being served at which places, and if those foods fit their needs. Instead, the dining menus are clunky and often incomplete, if they are even posted at all. If a servery is open, students should be able to read the website and see what food is available, rather than have to walk across campus to find out. H&D has a hard job; it’s not easy trying to provide food for thousands of students every day. We call not for a complete overhaul of on-campus dining, but rather for sufficient support to be extended by administration to H&D — whether in terms of personnel, funding or both — so that H&D can continue to serve the Rice community and fulfill its responsibility of housing and dining. Our university has the money to support more hiring and training of H&D staff, in addition to the in-progress building of a new servery and two new residential colleges. We only ask that admin consider devoting even a little bit more of that money and consideration towards H&D so as to improve the accessibility of on-campus dining.

crimson_2023_93,"I spent some of the summer after my first year at Harvard Law School working onthe case against Purdue Pharma, the company that infamously produced and marketed opioids to horrific ends. That case, which has now been settled, opened my eyes to the awful truth of how the Sackler-owned Purdue Pharma manufactured not just opioids, but the opioid overdose crisis we now find ourselves in. A staggering 107,600 Americans died in 2021 because of the crisis, 15 percent more than the year prior. And so, when I came to campus that fall to begin my first in-person year at Harvard Law, I was shocked to see the Sackler name again — this time, prominently displayed on one of the three buildings that compose the Harvard Art Museums. A sea change in public opinion, practical application, and even entertainment surrounding the opioid overdose crisis has begun to sweep through the country. Harvard has not just ignored that change, but steadfastly resisted it, choosing instead to defend the naming of the Arthur M. Sackler Building. Harvard has upheld its ties to the Sackler family even as experts (including at this University widely acknowledge them, via Purdue, to be responsible for organizing, fomenting, and ultimately profiting off the opioid overdose crisis and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It’s unclear whether the University has officially responded to thelatest proposal by students, earlier this academic year, to remove the Sackler name from the Harvard Art Museums. The fact that the Sacklers have, through their immense wealth and influence, essentiallypurchased their immunityfrom prosecution tied to opioid-related lawsuits makes it so much more damning that Harvard, in maintaining the Arthur M. Sackler Building, continues to offer a prestigious platform for their toxic philanthropy. Outside of the Harvard administration, the tide is shifting in how we as a society choose to respond to the opioid crisis. Two weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration approved over-the-counter sales of the overdose reversal drug Narcan, and we’ve seen renewed investigative reporting on elite institutions like Oxford University continuing to court the Sacklers. Just last month, President Joe Biden acknowledged the crisis in his State of the Union speech, and the month before that he signed a bill into law which will make it easier for people suffering from addiction to get the care they need. All told, we’re arriving at a tipping point for the opioid overdose crisis. And yet, Harvard seems willfully immune to the growing awareness slowly capturing the rest of the country that we must take action. The new documentary “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed,” director Laura Poitras’ film about the life, art, and anti-overdose activism of artist Nan Goldin, put Harvard’s inaction into relief for me. It is a real-life David and Goliath tale that artfully illustrates how the Sackler family has leveraged the worlds of art and elite philanthropy to evade accountability, openly laundering their public image. In 2018, Goldin organized arally at Harvardto remove the Sackler name from our buildings. In other words: Harvard has had notice. This call to action is not new — Harvard has simply failed to respond. “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed” also shows just how many other elite institutions have taken the opportunity to simply do better. Since that rally took place, institutions including The Louvre, The Guggenheim, London’s National Portrait Gallery, the Tate Modern, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art have all either scrapped the Sackler name or refused to take their money in future in the face of ongoing pressure from Goldin and her activist group, Prescription Addiction Intervention Now, as well as increasing public awareness and outrage. These institutions’ actions have shown that, despite any nominal internal constraints pulling them elsewhere, stopping the glorification of the profiteers behind today s opioid overdose crisis is a goal that is not only worthy, but possible. So why has Harvard held out? The University contends that Arthur Sackler died several years before the proliferation of OxyContin from the company his family controlled, and is therefore irrelevant in discussions about his family’s ties to the crisis. Nevermind that it was Arthur Sackler’s aggressive advertising and supercharged sales schemes that provided the playbook and fertile ground for an explosion of OxyContin sales just years after his death. It’s therefore easy to understand how a person like Arthur Sackler could possess both the ability to create an advertising scheme that skyrocketed use of opioids and a similar scheme to elevate his own family’s name via art institutions. Harvard is complicit in that calculated self-advertisement: Just as the Sackler family was able to deceive doctors and the public about the effects of opioids, Harvard and the Sacklers are deceiving the public about whether or not the Sackler family name is one worthy of our respect. Outgoing university president Lawrence S. Bacow hasreferred to callsto remove the Sackler name from our buildings as “inappropriate,” citing “legal and contractual obligations” as an insurmountable challenge. And yet other institutions who have moved to reject Sackler money or remove their name from buildings have been able to rise to this challenge. As Claudine Gay begins her tenure as president this summer, there has never been a better time to cut ties with the Sackler family once and for all. It is not a sign of weakness for Harvard to admit it has made the wrong call and join the side of progress, especially as the Harvard community pushes for change, year after year. It’s a shame it will have taken as long as it has, but the bigger shame would be continuing to prop up a family that has caused so much harm to so many. Harvard, it’s past time: Sack the Sacklers.

rice_thresher_2023_24,"ByZach Katz,Hannah Thalenberg,Anna RajagopalandSeth Uzman10/3/23 11:58pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. We are Jewish Rice students, alumni and community members who fully support Rice PRIDE’sdecisionto cut ties with Houston Hillel, and who fundamentally reject the notion of one, hegemonic, Jewish opinion regarding Zionism on Rice University’s campus. The assertions that Rice PRIDE’s decision to part ways with Houston Hillel is “antisemitic” or alienates Jewish students reduce Jewish personhood on Rice University’s campus to a singular definition of what it means to be Jewish, and stonewalls many of us out of a conversation that directly impacts our lives. Zionism is a political movement founded by Theodor Herzl, withoriginsin Europe in the late 1800s. Many early Zionist thinkers, including Herzl, openly characterized the movement as acolonial oneand called for the expulsion of native Palestinians. As such, Zionism is not an identity,but a political ideologymaterially expressed through the project of Palestine’s colonization. In order to establish the state of Israel, over 750,000 Palestinians wereforcibly displacedfrom their land and over 400 villages were completely destroyed by Zionist forces. In the name of Zionism, Israel imposes what Amnesty International deems anillegal occupation and apartheid systemover Palestinians, routinelydemolishing Palestinian homesandarresting Palestinian youthen masse. Rejection of this political ideology and the organizations which advance it represents a principled stance against colonialism and racism, and is one that all people of faith should unequivocally and unwaveringly uphold. Indeed, it is dishonest to separate Houston Hillel from its explicit pro-Israel advocacy, and therefore disingenuous to mischaracterize Rice PRIDE’s decision as exclusionary to queer Jews on campus. At the 2018 Policy Conference for the American-Israel Political Action Committee, Houston Hillel was awarded theAIPAC’s Ally of the Year.This designation is the product of years of events, actions and programs that whitewash Israel’s violent colonization of Palestine and delegitimize efforts to hold Israel accountable for its crimes. A testament to this is Houston Hillel’s participation in thePerspectives Tripto “Israel and the Palestinian Authority.” This trip is sponsored by theMaccabee Task Force, an organization established to delegitimize theBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctionsmovement by propagatingdeeply racist, anti-Palestinian, Islamophobic tropesabout its origins and practice. BDS, the powerful tactic which contributed to the fall of South African Apartheid, is one of the more prominent movements in support of Palestinian freedom internationally. Because of activities such as Houston Hillel’scelebrationof the anniversary of Israel s colonization of Palestine, their promotion ofIsrael fellowshipsand theircelebration of Israeli Occupation Forces, it is clear that this partnershippresented a threatto the safety of Palestinian and Arab students. Therefore, we reject attempts to slander and mischaracterize Rice PRIDE’s decision and instead affirm their commitment to freedom and justice. As members of a dynamic community, we believe that Houston Hillel does not provide meaningful Jewish engagement to Jewish students ofallidentities and backgrounds, namely,those of uswho reject the weaponization of Jewish identity to serve the colonization of Palestine. We challenge media coverage which centers the narrative of Zionist groups as opposed to that of the students making a statement — editorials that paint Rice PRIDE’s decision as “too hasty” or news articles thatplatform claimsthat the decision was not inclusive of Jewish students — and instead offer the following: Distorting our collective identity as Jewish people to engage in thedoxxing, harassment and outingof already marginalized queer students is dangerous to those students and unfair to us, and we will not allow the dominance of colonial thought to overtake the importance of Jewish values such astzedek(“justice” andchesed(“loving kindness” . Moreover, if those who opposed Rice PRIDE’s decision truly cared about the well-being of all students, the aftermath of said decision would not have resulted in fellow LGBTQ+ students fearing for their safety on and off campus. The opinions of those who support and endorse Hillel International’s “Standards of Partnership” do not reflect or represent our own as educated Jewish individuals. It is because of our understanding of Jewish tradition and values that we are able to differentiate between Zionism and Judaism, between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. We find it urgent to dispel the myth that Rice PRIDE has behaved in any way that could be construed as hostile to Jewish students. As a collective, we stand by Rice PRIDE’s decision to end partnership with Houston Hillel. We believe Houston Hillel is complicit inoccupation and apartheid,explicitly excludesPalestinian and Arab students and does not provide safety and security to students regardless of their identities. We encourage Jewish students at Rice to seek out, create and engage with other Jewish organizations, particularly those that center principles of justice and equality. In this vein, we are committed to facilitating and aiding partnership between Rice PRIDE and Jewish groups that provide meaningful, educational, religious and spiritual resources to Jewish college students, such as Judaism On Our Own Terms, Jewish Voice for Peace and other Jewish groups aligned with PRIDE’s values. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

ubyssey_2023_38,"March 6, 2023 Written byUbyssey news staff All year, we’ve been attending governance meetings and keeping an eye on what’s going on in the governance bodies at UBC. Here s a short rundown on what we think of each referenda item. We’re not here to tell how to vote, but we will be honest each question up for a vote. Behold,The Ubyssey’s guide to the 2023 AMS Elections referenda. The most visible bylaw change is the proposed creation of an Indigenous Constituency. According to Indigenous students, this would allow for them to unite Indigenous groups under one unit and allow for better self-governance, since the existing Indigenous Committee is bound to follow the AMS’s committee structure. The bylaw changes also include the elimination of some AMS Council seats, a change to the number of active members a constituency must have to have a Council seat or additional seats, a change to how Council can remove executives and power to the president to liaise with constituencies. The most troubling is the consolidation of affiliate school seats — all religious affiliate schools operate under different agreements with the province, making it tricky for one person to represent them all. However, it’s worth voting ‘yes’ for these changes to ensure the creation of the Indigenous constituency. This referendum proposes an increase of $52.50 to the current $277.50 AMS/GSS Health & Dental Plan fee. In the last two years, the AMS health plan has seen significant claim increases, with students claiming $6.96 million last year, compared to $4.32 million in 2020/21. This fee increase plans to address the increasing number of student claims while ensuring students receive the same level of coverage. It is important to note that the gender-affirming care referendum is contingent on this referendum passing. Thus, this deserves a ‘yes’ vote to guarantee extended coverage for students. Trans students at UBC are dangerously under-insured by the current AMS/GSS Health & Dental Plan, posing significant financial barriers for gender-affirming care. Despite councillors hearing personal testimonies regarding transphobic harassment at the February 13 AMS Council meeting, councillors voted to separate the $8 gender-affirming care fee increase from the general $52.50 fee increase. This act demonstrated the councillors disregard for the Trans community, effectively increasing their visibility and heightening the chances of Trans violence. This is worth a ‘yes’ vote and serves as your opportunity to protect the health care rights of the campus Trans community. The Ubysseyreleased an editorial in support of the Trans Coalition’s efforts on March 3. This is the second time the Bike Kitchen has filed a referendum to raise its fee, after last year’s failed to meet quorum. The non-profit bike repair and education shop has accumulated over $50,000 in debt since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting its ability to run free programs. In order to allow it to refocus on accessible community events, the Bike Kitchen said it needs a $3 increase to its existing $1.17. While the details on how the Bike Kitchen got into such a dire financial situation are a bit fuzzy, the fee increase is fairly small and worth it for such a valuable community resource.

crimson_2023_138,"Congratulations to the Class of 2023 on making it to graduation day! If you’re anything like I was approaching Commencement, you’re feeling proud, excited, a little sad to be ending your college journey, immensely relieved to be done with your final final exams, and grateful for four great years. The world is open to you, and you undoubtedly have impressive professional accomplishments ahead. Some of you will pursue a career in public service, as I have. Some of you will not. I will not try to dissuade anyone from their chosen career path. But I will make the case that service is for everyone, and you should find a place for it in your life. There is a tendency to think of success in terms of degrees, professional accomplishments, and job titles. But success is also measured in services to those without the same privilege you enjoy as Harvard alumni. My mom was a career educator. My dad led the Manhattan chapter of the New York Urban League and later helped run homeless shelters. Some of my earliest memories with them are of being stopped on the street by their former students and clients who just wanted to say “thank you.” As an impatient child, I was often pulling on them to move on, but those encounters made a tremendous impression on me. I saw the fruits of my parents’ service in the faces of people whose lives they improved in ways big and small. When I got to Harvard, I incorporated service into my life there, volunteering as a teacher and mentor through the Phillips Brooks House Association. And I have continued to teach — for a time as a law school professor and currently as a volunteer Sunday school teacher at my church. Teaching and making genuine connections with young people remains deeply fulfilling to me, even though it’s been a relatively small part of my professional life. As a student at the College, I also pursued service by advocating for policy change. I served on the Student Advisory Committee at the Institute of Politics, and as president of the Black Students Association. Those experiences ultimately served me well in my career in government, although my path was not straight. My first job out of college was as a consultant (like so many of you! . But I continued to volunteer in my personal life, and since law school, the majority of my career has been in public service, as a federal and state prosecutor. In many ways, I have achieved in my career in the traditional sense of the word. But achievement isn’t the most important throughline in my career. The connecting thread, as I see it, is using different areas of the law to address power asymmetries: suing or prosecuting people in privileged positions who stole from government programs, companies that exploited workers, law enforcement officers who abused their power, healthcare companies that denied mental health treatment to people in need, and businesses that financed violent crime. In the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, I have focused on expanding our services for survivors of crime who often feel left behind by the criminal justice system. We have embedded alternatives to incarceration into the core of our practice to ensure that people who have been failed by countless societal systems get the services they need and break the cycle of recidivism. I have not always seen the faces of the people who have benefited from my work, as I saw with my mom and dad’s former students and clients, but I know that I am using my Harvard education to help people who need a powerful ally to level the playing field. Whether it is in your career or as a volunteer in your community, I encourage you to do something to serve. Advance your career, yes, but also measure your success but what you do for others — students taught, victims counseled, patients healed. Systemic change requires advocates both inside and outside the government. You do not have to pick just one lane, and you do not have to take a straight path. Follow your particular passion at a particular moment in time. And regardless of what your day job is, remember that there are lots of ways to serve. One of my favorite scriptures comes from the Gospel of Luke: “To whom much is given, much will be required.” I was provided the opportunity of a great experience at Harvard. For me, that opportunity came with an obligation to serve. When I was a kid, I don’t think I knew where my parents went to college. I may not have known their exact job titles. But I saw their resumes of accomplishments in the people who stopped us on the street to offer thanks. If my kids can say the same about me in 40 years, I will have had a successful career. I wish you the same as you embark on your next chapter. Alvin L. Bragg, Jr., ’95 is a graduate of Harvard Law School and the current District Attorney of Manhattan."
crimson_2023_50,"At Harvard, the most meaningful government decisions affecting our daily lives happen not in Washington, D.C., but just down the block. If you’ve complained about potholes, enjoyed block parties, or ridden on new protected bike lanes, you’ve interacted in some way with Cambridge’s local government. The work that occurs at Cambridge City Hall affects all of us. Yet, on the whole, few people on campus pay any attention. For instance, statistically speaking, if you’re reading this and live in the Quad, the odds that someone in your ward voted in themost recent municipal electionsare about 3/10. If you live in River Central or River West, those odds are closer to 1/10. This year, that must change. Cambridge’s upcoming election is an intensely contested one, different from what weusually expectfrom local races. On Tuesday, Nov. 7, Harvard students have the chance to impact the allocation of an operating and capital budget that totals more than $1 billion — money that Harvard students benefit from in the form of the infrastructure we use every day. If you care about mobility justice in Cambridge, holding police accountable for their impact on the community, or the prospect of having somewhere affordable to live during graduate school, then this Tuesday must matter. Both on and off campus, many of us hold the misguided belief that 2023 is “an off-cycle year” because there won’t be regular federal elections. This view translates into some organizers believing they should spend their time “building relationships and getting everyone ready for 2024.” That approach ignores the critical importance of local elections. The media and pundits may focus on federal elections, but our votes in those races have little impact. Most Americans live in Congressional districts thatare not competitive. Onlya small proportion live in one of eight states with competitive2024 Senate electionsor one of seven likely to becompetitive in the 2024 presidential election. Plus, despite the constant attention American society pays to national politics, the reality is that most of us interact with the federal government infrequently. Lawmakers in Washington govern335 million people, while those in Cambridge govern a far smaller population — and have a more direct impact on our lives. Despite this impact, local elections consistently have weak turnout. On average,just 27 percentof eligible voters participate in municipal elections. In Cambridge in 2021, a mere33 percent of voterscast their ballots to impact city policies. New and returning city councilors will decide the fate ofprotected bike lanes,affordable housing,environmental justice,police reform, and more. Every registered voter at Harvard should help ensure the proper governance of this incredible city we call home. Although individual students are relatively transient, as a voting bloc, they comprise around 29 percentof the city’s population. Nonetheless, younger voters participate in local elections at far lower rates than older voters – perhaps because they pay less attention to these races. Yet, a mere185 votesdecided the most recent Cambridge City Council election. We have significantly more power to redefine our city’s future than many believe. Massachusetts confers college students with the right to vote in the place where we receive our higher education. In many states, like neighboring New Hampshire, conservative governments have enacted laws torestrict students’ right to voteprecisely because of the fear that we will recognize our power and use it. Perhaps we might even disrupt the status quo, shifting power toward candidates who promote policies more oriented toward the needs of young people — a group pretty clearly underrepresented in government. This Tuesday, students registered to vote have the unique opportunity to help set our city’s priorities, impact the distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars, and improve the lives of tens of thousands of residents. Let’s not waste this opportunity. This Tuesday, go vote. Clyve Lawrence ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Government concentrator in Adams House. Eamon C.

crimson_2023_114,"I live a 428.7-mile drive away from my mother. As she prepares breakfast for one in my childhood home, I lie asleep, enveloped in the sounds and stenches of my first-year dorm. While she fixes her hair for a big meeting, I have a heated debate on Annenberg Hall’s top five beverages. While she settles down with her favorite show before bed, I try to calculate how many times my Solo cup has been filled in the past hour. Clearly, my mom and I lead very different lives. But despite the distance, we’ve found a way to stay connected beyond phone calls or text messages: through images in our shared camera roll. A few months before moving to Cambridge, realizing that I’d never have enough storage capacity on my phone to keep up with the thousands of images I’d presumably be taking at college, I decided to give in to a nebulous, all-knowing space: the cloud. As a result of that decision, every image I take can be accessed from my mother’s device, and vice versa. This strategy has its pitfalls. By nature, a photo album presents an opportunity to create meaningful bonds between photographer and viewer. A touching objective, sure — but there are parts of the college experience one just doesn t want their parent to see. Thus, I created a hidden album, which she has yet to find. The rest of my life, however, is fair game. Predictably, sharing these intimacies, abstractions, and minutiae with my mom has stimulated a dialogue unlike any other. I’ve been forced to field a variety of interesting questions, like why my posture looks so bad in pictures, what the name of that person in my photo album who looks like Mark Zuckerberg is, and why there aren’t any pictures of me studying. But regardless of these small annoyances, our shared space is still a wonderful thing. It represents a step towards the transparency that can be fostered between parents and children, despite the jolt of fear that this vulnerability often elicits for people my age. Such an anxiety is all too familiar to me: As a child of a single-parent immigrant household, I craved my mom’s praise. I kept my head down, did well in school, and made nice friends, trying my best not to cause her any problems. I concealed from her facets of the real me. I’ve found that since entering college, the shared album has started to break down this barrier. Beyond acting as a device for introspection, the photo album also helps to ease the burden of our physical separation. As I imagine may be the case for many of my peers as well, attending college away from home has created some strain on my relationships. Communicating long-distance is hard, and sometimes I can’t muster up the energy to give a play-by-play of my week over the phone. But when I struggle to find the right words, my photo album can fill in the gaps. My camera roll tells the little stories of my life: the happy moments, like the day I got free Zinneken’s, to the less pleasant ones, like the time I realized that the strange smell in the dorm was coming from a molding slice of what I imagine was once pizza that my roommate had left in the fridge six months prior. When I can’t find the words to describe how I feel after a bad night out or convey the feeling of my pounding headache, the album has me covered. Ultimately, the album acts as a sort of interactive diary. Nothing compares to the simultaneous feelings of joy and surprise that come with discovering a picture of my mom’s new Swiffer, or stumbling on a sneaky shot of my middle school gym teacher walking her dog. Before consciously internalizing the idea that my photos exist in a common space, I never realized how much of my life I chose to capture through images. This semester, I have begun to reflect on what kind of narrative I’m creating through photography — how true a picture (no pun intended I’m painting of my time on campus. In one fell swoop, a collection of my favorite people, best meals, and most questionable outfits can be accessed, my album an amalgamation of all of my highs and lows. But despite the wide array of pictures that it carries, not every important moment makes it into my shared album. The story of my semester extends beyond my Tatte order to the more visceral moments of college existence: late-night heart-to-hearts, sweaty dance parties in the middle of the common room, and the butterflies I get before taking an exam. In that spirit, I’ve recently started trying to distill the collection: I print out my most impactful photos to let myself reflect on what I believe is truly worth sharing. If you struggle to pick up the phone to call your loved ones during a hectic week, I recommend trying out a shared album or two. It’ll give you the convenience of streamlining your life updates — but more importantly, it’ll let you share a piece of yourself with those who care. Julia S.

ubyssey_2023_14,"July 25, 2023 Written byIman Janmohamed Hi Iman, I realized I have to take five years to finish my degree and I am so embarrassed. Is it really ok to take longer than four to graduate? It’s totally normal to take more than four years to complete your degree! Things come up — work, life, maybe you changed your major once or twice, maybe you had to prioritize your health — and even if nothing came up, that’s ok, too! There’s no shame in taking longer to graduate, no matter the reason. Co-op? Cool. Wanted to chill for a bit? Sick. Needed to take time off to deal with some personal things? I’m glad you did! I can guarantee you that you won’t care that you graduated “late” five months, let alone five years after graduation. I know, I know that “LiFe iSn’T a rAcE, iT’s aBoUt tHe jOuRnEy” stuff is annoying when it seems like everyone is getting the hell out of UBC and suddenly working in client acquisition at Deloitte, but it’s the truth. You’re your own worst critic and it does no one any good comparing yourself to others — everyone’s situations are different and everyone does things at their own pace. Give yourself some grace and understand that it’s not that deep even though it might seem like it is. How long you take to graduate doesn’t define you, and way fewer people graduate in four years than you think. But again, who cares about that anyway? When your first-year RA tells you and your roommate that “five is the new four,” they aren’t lying — fewer people graduate in four years than you think (and the graduation data proves it , so don’t stress out. No one really questions your graduation timeline, and if someone does and clowns you for taking an extra year (or two, or three they’re being weird.

stanforddaily_2023_27,"In 1947, when my grandmother was 12 years old, her father died from diabetes. Due to a lack of viable treatments, complications of diabetes often went untreated. My own dad, who has been rail thin his whole life, is prediabetic, teetering close to the dreaded “D.” He tells me that he has to cut carbs and sugars — and he wants me to understand why I should do the same. I learn from him that those of us with a predilection for type 2 diabetes need to figure out how to move our 21st-century lifestyles closer to the traditional lifestyles where our ancestors didn’t develop type 2 diabetes in droves. We need to walk and exercise more to burn off the extra fat so that it doesn’t fill up our body cavities. We need to avoid overconsumption and make sure our diet is lower in empty carbs and higher in nutrition and fiber — closer to thetraditional Asian diet filled with fresh vegetables. 75 years after my great-grandfather’s passing, I googled my way to understanding my unfortunate family legacy. When someone has type 2 diabetes, while they may have basic bodily mechanisms in place to regulate their blood sugar levels, there is excess sugar in their bloodstream, and their cells don’t work efficiently enough to use it. The extra sugar unutilized by their cells turns into fat. This part of the story is where my family’s Asian ethnicity comes into play. Those of us with Asian heritage are at least30-50% more likelyto develop type 2 diabetes than persons of European descent. Only recently has science begun to unravel the mystery of why that is. A key culprit lies in the type and location of our fat. As a group, Asians havelower BMIsthan Caucasian people and that’s why, like my Dad, we often fall well within the standard “healthy” weight and height charts our doctors use. However, Asians actually have ahigher percentage of fatthan Caucasians. In addition to having less lean muscle, we tend to have more of the “bad” kind of fat in our bodies that kickstarts type 2 diabetes:visceral fat. This fat is hidden deep in our torsos, between our organs. Because of its concealed location, this type of fat doesn’t cause people to look “bigger.” Meanwhile, subcutaneous fat, which is located just below the skin, is more visible. Ironically, although subcutaneous fat makes a person look larger, it’s actually considered “good” fat by physicians because it doesn’t cause diabetes. Caucasians tend to accumulate subcutaneous fat before they accumulate visceral fat.Asians, on the other hand, tend to accumulate visceral fat over subcutaneous fat. This is one reason why a young Asian person who appears thin could have elevated blood sugar levels and even be diabetic. Modern science, including the study of genetics, is helping to unravel the mystery of why there is an epidemic of type 2 diabetes among Asians, both in the United States and in Asia. For example, scientists have found that thetraditional Chinese lifestyleinvolved strenuous physical activity and a low-calorie diet consisting of carbohydrates and little animal fat. In this environment, it may have been an advantage for one’s body to run efficiently on as little fuel — sugar — as possible. Moreover, less muscle mass meant less chance of burning up an already meager stash of fuel. Now take that lean, mean, fuel-efficient machine to modern-day America: food is plentiful, processed and filled with empty sugars and carbs, and most people don’t engage in the manual labor of their forebears. This may have overwhelmed the machinery of our bodies that evolved for physical hardship and low calories. Furthermore, this emphasis onoverconsumptionandlack of exercisehas started to spread to countries in Asia as well. The resulting type 2 diabetes epidemic has made us Asians victims of our own prosperity. The legacy of type 2 diabetes in Asians can be compared to that of sickle cell anemia in people of African descent. In people of Asian descent, having more visceral fat and less lean muscle mass may have been helpful in times of famine, but these traits have led to problems like diabetes in more prosperous times. Meanwhile, in people of African descent, having the sickle cell trait can provide people with anadvantage against malaria fatality, which used to be extremely beneficial due to lack of treatment for malaria. However, the sickle cell trait can also lead tosevere health complications, including infection and pain. But knowledge can go a long way towards coping with these conditions. I now understand that there are differences in diabetes vulnerability even among the different subgroups under the broad “Asian” umbrella.Korean, Japanese or Chinese ancestry puts you a notch up on the type 2 diabetes scale over Caucasian people.South Asians,Pacific Islanders and Filipinosaregenerally even higher upon that scale. The point is that we all need to be aware of what our own ethnic heritage predisposes us to so that we can take action. As an Asian American, my hope is that during my lifetime, medical research will find ways to diminish my susceptibility towards metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. In the meantime, I’m looking everywhere I can for small lifestyle changes to improve my odds for fighting diabetes, whether it’s simply swapping a sugary Frappuccino for an unsweetened iced tea or taking a few laps around Meyer Green."

crimson_2023_143,"I’m old enough to have witnessed many pivotal events at Harvard and many changes to its evolving culture. For example, when I graduated from Harvard Law School in 1967, I was one of 493 men in a class with only 26 women. Today, this gender gap has significantly decreased; in fact, there are more women than men in the J.D. Class of 2025. My law school class was composed almost entirely of Caucasians. Looking through the snapshots of faces in my yearbook, I see only 11 African Americans: nine men and two women. There is a section celebrating, if you will, the “Harvard Law Wives,” a group that in 1967 was in its 39th year. The wives reported that “The year commenced in the fall with a buffet supper and a tea given by Mrs. Griswold to introduce the new wives to Cambridge and to each other.” The referenced “Mrs. Griswold” was the wife of Erwin N. Griswold, dean of the Law School from 1946 until 1967. It is difficult to forget his remarks on day one of law school, for they began more or less as follows (from distant but vivid memory : “Gentlemen: Welcome to Harvard Law School. Look to your left and look to your right. One of the three of you will not be here at this time next year.” Given the sternness of Griswold’s message, perhaps my 26 female classmates were not terribly offended to have escaped his attention. The Law School was not at all unique. A similar culture prevailed in the College, with which I had occasion to become quite familiar shortly after graduation. I worked for a small Boston law firm for my first year out, but shortly thereafter I founded my own firm along with two other lawyers — Norman S. Zalkind and John G. S. Flym. It was our first big case that brought me back to Harvard. I recall that a veritable mob of students had engaged in an anti-war demonstration in Harvard Yard. By this time, students were refusing to show up when receiving induction notices, resulting in indictments. The firm of Flym, Zalkind, and Silverglate became expert in ‘draft law.’ But the most memorable case involved the Harvard Yard riot in 1969. A couple hundred students had taken over University Hall to protest the Reserve Officer Training Corps and its affiliated scholarships, as well as Harvard’s expansion into neighboring Cambridge communities. University Hall housed the heart of the administration, and the students famously forced then-Assistant Dean Archie C. Epps III, one of the few African American administrators at Harvard back then, out of the building when he refused to leave. In the end, 196 demonstrators ended up being arrested for the riot. Twelve reporters were immediately released, leaving 184 to be arraigned on charges of criminal trespass. At the Cambridge District Court trial, I remember the judge divided the defendants into smaller groups because the courtroom was not large enough to hold them all. In Middlesex County Superior Court, Flym, Zalkind, and I did our best, but we deemed the case hopeless, what with dozens of photographs of what transpired. Yet, to our surprise, the jury acquitted — a sign of the unpopularity of that war. Volume 71, number 11 of theHarvard Alumni Bulletin, dated April 28, 1969, describes how: “Students accused of criminal trespass were freed on personal recognizance, while those who could not show bursar’s cards were required to post $20 bail.” Looking back, what strikes me is the fact that Epps alone functionally filled the role of dean of students. Today, his shoes are filled — to the extent they will ever be filled — by an army of deans, deputy deans, assistant deans and so forth, who actually outnumber the faculty and inflate the College’s near $80,000 annual price tag. But my main purpose here is neither to reminisce nor to recount the trials and tribulations of your predecessors, nor to criticize this august institution. My task is to give you parting words for the future. But I am hardly the most qualified. In my view, the wisest words were penned by cartoonist Garry Trudeau, creator of “Doonesbury.” He penned two strips that are particularly relevant. In one, a few graduating college students discuss the “depressing” tuition debt that they owe before the dean takes the podium and states that: “All students owing more than $100,000 are invited to meet with debt counselors in the field house following today’s ceremony.” Graduation is a time of celebration, but one cannot help the dreary thought of the unreasonableness of the accumulated debt. In the other strip, the commencement speaker, seemingly aware of the hypersensitivity on most university campuses — a phenomenon known as “political correctness” — regurgitates a variety of administrative jargon, explaining that “The intra-college sensitivity advisory committee has vetted the text of even trace amounts of subconscious racism, sexism, and classism” and that “any offensive elements of Western rationalism and linear logic” as well as “references flowing from a white, male, Eurocentric perspective have been eliminated,” before ending the speech with a simple “Thank you and good luck,” offering the students little encouragement and advice. And so, members of the Harvard graduating class of 2023, it is my hope that despite shouldering the burdensome debt and the power to reform the education system for future generations, you will prosper. I thank you for your patience, as I assume that by now you have read my entire diatribe, and I wish you all good luck. Harvey A. Silverglate is a graduate of Harvard Law School and staged a write-in campaign for this year’s Board of Overseers election."
stanforddaily_2023_70,"Dear reader, I’m writing this letter from Stanford’s study abroad program in Florence, which is to say: for the past several weeks, I have had gelato nearly every day. Food, I suppose, has been top of mind for reasons beyond the theme of this magazine. After all, meals are sacred in Italy. You won’t find open laptops at the dinner table, or hear “Let’s grab lunch soon!” tossed around as an empty send-off. I have yet to see an Italian eating on public transport; the person who simultaneously walks and gnaws away at a panino, I’ve realized, is probably a tourist. Here, mealtime is not an occasion suited to multitasking — it’s something to be cherished and experienced in its own right. But perhaps I’m romanticizing, exaggerating these cultural differences a bit. For thereisa culture of gratitude and appreciation at Stanford vis-à-vis food, as evidenced by the stories in this issue. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, as Serena Lee ’25 reports, you can visit the lively farmers’ market at White Plaza.

crimson_2023_11,"On January 19, after around a week of student and alumni advocacy and widespread media attention, Harvard Kennedy School’s Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf acknowledged that he had “made an error in his decision not to appoint Kenneth Roth as a Fellow at the Carr Center for Human Rights.” Again and again, I heard sighs of relief at how academic freedom had been saved at Harvard. Rosy as the reversal sounded, the accompanying sighs highlighted an expected but disappointing reality: Harvard students are often content to advocate for politically neutral academic freedom, but many stay silent when it comes to confronting the brutal oppression of Palestinians. It seems a couple points were absent from Dean Elmendorf’s announcement. At no point did he address the elephant in the room: what scholars likeCornel R. West ’74 have allegedas Harvard’s complicity in silencing voices that call for Palestinian freedom. While I welcome the reversal, let’s be clear: What is essentially a tactical decision deserves little praise. I’m sure Dean Elmendorf wouldn’t have wanted some reaction like a fired-up student body holding placards in the Kennedy School lobby; God forbid a public scandal besmirch Harvard’s gleaming reputation. Instead, it would be much easier to give Roth a fellowship, apologize for the temporary doubt cast upon HKS’s sacred mission, and hope that everything would be swept under the rug by the time we arrived back for our first week of classes. But Roth’s allegation that Elmendorf denied his fellowship on the basis of Human Rights Watch’s “anti-Israel bias” under his leadership cannot be swept under the rug. What “bias” really appears to mean is that Roth doesn’t cower down to the deeply-rooted racism against Palestinians I believe is present throughout United States foreign policy and the Kennedy School itself. To be precise, Roth isn’t afraid to call Israel what Amnesty International agrees it is: anapartheid regime. I’d wager that Roth’s courage in calling out Israel’s apartheid regime is despised by some at the Kennedy School. It’s much easier to keep discussing stability in the world in conversations I believe functionally mislead and dehumanize people, treating Palestinians like chess-pieces to be disposed of where America’s interests deem fit. At the end of the day, what’s a little collateral damage to keep Uncle Sam on top? In his announcement of the reversal, Dean Elmendorf said his initial decision “inadvertently cast doubt on the mission of the School.” So it’s worth reexamining what, exactly, thismission represents. The Kennedy School claims to “improve public policy and leadership so people can live in societies that are more safe, free, just, and sustainably prosperous.” What definition of safe, free, and just makes it permissible to turn a blind eye to what evenIsraeli historiansand journalistshave labeled ethnic cleansing? Perhaps they mean free from accountability. Or free to unleash relentless violence against Palestinians under the guise of stability. Perhaps it is the same brand of freedom that justifies U.S.-backed interventions, regime changes, and crimes against humanity across the Global South. Get the beers and hotdogs out — Henry Kissinger is bringing you freedom! Similarly, HKS’s track record of offering positions should make us skeptical of the sincerity of its mission statement. HKS has proudly lended its name toAmos Yadlin, a former general in the Israeli Air Force who participated in the brutal war on Lebanon in 1982. Yadlin isknown to be an architectof the Israeli military s policy on “targeted killings” — killings of Israeli government-designated terrorists without trial that have resulted in scores of civilian deaths. The U.N.’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has declared these civilian killings unlawful and suggested they may violate the Geneva Convention, but HKS is happy to provide Yadlin with a platform to teach about national security. Yadlin is only one of several questionable characters. As Harvard students, we cannot continue to let our University welcome agents ofcolonial violencewhiledenying thosewho reject U.S.-backed Israeli apartheid. HKS reversed the initial decision in Roth’s case, but it happened only after wide public criticism due to Roth’s global platform and stature. If this was how Harvard treated a renowned figure, what is happening to the voices of Palestinian supporters with less extensive platforms? What Roth’s situation made blatantly clear is this: Pressure works. I find it unlikely, to say the least, that Dean Elmendorf woke up one day, in the midst of a public relations storm targeted at him, and discovered his moral conscience. It is far more plausible that he reversed the decision because of the immense backlash from student organizing groups, faculty members, and news outlets. But if we really care about freedom for Palestinians, appointing Kenneth Roth is the bare minimum. We must start to apply pressure and amplify Palestianians’ demands for justice. We cannot be satisfied with hollow apology emails. We cannot be satisfied with mere verbal commitments to anti-racism; we must demanddivestment from companiescomplicit in Israel’s human rights violations against Palestinians, and a University environment that treats Palestinian freedom as central to human rights. To call for accountability means to go beyond echoing the politically neutral call for free speech and ask ourselves difficult questions: In silencing Kenneth Roth, what was Harvard trying to shield its students from? And in reinstating his fellowship without addressing its own considerable bias, who does Harvard continue to silence? Josh D. Wilcox ’23 is a Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations concentrator in Pforzheimer House and an organizer for Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee."
crimson_2023_155,"What group is prioritized more heavily in elite college admissions than children of alumni or beneficiaries of affirmative action? Recruited athletes. Controlling for differences between applicants, athletes arethousands of times more likelyto be admitted than similar non-athletes.Recent researchfinds that only 11 percent of admitted athletes at Ivy League and similarly elite schools would have been accepted without athletic preference. We’re not talking about just a couple spots. Harvard has the most Division I sports teams in the country, with recruited athletes accounting for about 11 percent of recent incoming classes. I’ve read plenty of articles discussing legacy admissions and affirmative action, but I could hardly find any recent Crimson opinion pieces discussing athlete preference — despite the significant preference given to athletes. Maybe athletic preferences are so self-evidently legitimate that they’re beyond discussion. Indeed, many of the acceptances for recruited athletes can rightly be celebrated as meritorious. But certain athletic preferences do not deserve to escape such scrutiny. Former University President Lawrence H. Summers recently coined an excellent term for these cases: “aristocrat sports,” where membership and success are sharply defined by familial resources. In light of recent research detailing the systematic bias toward wealthy applicants at Ivy-plus schools, Summers is right to call for scrutinizing aristocratic athletic preference. Think of sports like squash, rowing, and fencing. Data do not exist on the average wealth of Harvard athletes by sport, but arecent Wall Street Journal reportfound that nearly 90 percent of Ivy League squash players attended private high schools with fees of around $30,000, and two-thirds of Ivy League lacrosse and crew athletes attended similarly expensive schools. Even the public school students who do play these sports often come from very rich districts. In line with these statistics, a recent study found that nearly a quarter of the admissions advantage for wealthy students in the Ivy League is due to athlete recruitment. Because class and race are closely intertwined, athletic recruiting also serves to favor white applicants. A senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union called such preferences “informal discrimination” and the Atlantic labeled them “a quiet sort ofaffirmative action foraffluent white kids.” Indeed, Harvard’s recruited athletes pool is substantially less diverse than the school as a whole. It’s not that those incoming athletes haven’t worked incredibly hard or aren’t incredibly talented. They have and they are. But the very opportunity to participate in these sports — much less to receive personalized coaching — is available to a very select few who are lucky enough to be born to wealthy parents, and so giving preferences to these sports tilts the admissions playing field towards the privileged. If you don’t happen to attend a handful of rich prep schools mostly located in the Northeast, this entire admissions channel is largely off limits to you. While our admissions department should attempt to cultivate excellence in the incoming class, it should not sacrifice fairness to do so. World class rowers are world class. But that doesn’t mean they deserve a spot at Harvard. It may be unfair to single out these sports when so many parts of the admissions system — from essay writing to extracurriculars — can be gamed by those with the resources and time to do so. But there’s a spectrum to how much income can affect certain opportunities, and aristocrat sports are an especially egregious example. Having rich parents is nearly a prerequisite to playing some of these sports, whereas the financial barriers to having impressive extracurriculars or an outstanding essay are much lower. (But if I thought those metrics were as wealth-dependent as elite sports, I would call for a reconsideration of them too! Moreover, the inherent unfairness of admissions is actually a positive reason to prioritize more objective and accessible metrics of talent,like test scores, whenever possible. The alternative — to simply surrender to the unfairness of admissions — is inadequate. Even if essay writing or extracurricular opportunities were as stratified by income as sports recruiting, those categories don’t have their own separate admissions system like athletics does. No one gets a designated liaison lobbying to admit them for having a really outstanding personal statement. Harvard has taken one of the activities most subject to income disparities and made it into an admissions backdoor. What’s to be done? Even if you aren’t on board with abandoning aristocrat sports recruiting entirely, there are a number of pragmatic solutions that can achieve similar ends. One approach,proposed by Harvard Economics professor Raj Chetty ’00, is to diversify recruitment for these teams. Our University could also follow in MIT’s footsteps by subjecting recruited athletes to the same admissions standards as other students. This change would reduce but not eliminate the preference for such teams. However we choose to proceed, the current system is clearly broken.As I’ve written before, Harvard is dominated by the rich by design. If Harvard is serious about improving its socioeconomic diversity, reforming aristocrat sports is low-hanging fruit.

At the last Faculty Senate meeting, a few senators, in a highly unusual procedural move, surprised the body by introducing a controversial motion that “the association of Rebekah Mercer and Rupert Murdoch in all positions of responsibility or honor at Stanford University be terminated due to their promulgation of dangerous, racist and antisemitic misinformation.” As everybody in the room knew, neither Mercer or Murdoch promulgated such information. They own news organizations that have been accused of promulgating such positions. It is a well-accepted tenet of journalism that owners of newspapers do not have direct control over content. But leaving that aside, what if they did? Would that be a reason to terminate their association with Stanford? As I understand the argument made by the proponents of this motion, the notion of academic freedom is fine unless it concerns a certain set of abhorrent ideas agreed on by the vast majority of society. This argument ignores the fact that this is exactly the position the people who hold the abhorrent views take. For example, Hitler believed in academic freedom so long as you agreed the Jews were such an evil they needed to be exterminated. I am not making areductio-ad-absurdumargument here. I mean this seriously. Nazis do not walk around believing they are bad people. They believe that their principles are actually so good that they do not need to be put to public debate. They believe that these ideas should be imposed on people who are too ignorant to understand. Most of my mother’s family was killed in the Holocaust as a direct result of that belief. The proponents of the Senate’s motion feel that their views are universally accepted and that that justifies the view that these subjects are beyond debate. I grew up in South Africa under apartheid. There, it was almost universally accepted amongst white people that races could not get along and needed to be forcibly separated. Some people were put in jail if they opposed that view. If you were white, you were certainly socially ostracized if you held the opposing view. And when you would argue for another view, people would cite exactly the same argument. They would say that freedom of speech was not absolute, that races just couldn’t get along, that black people were anyway inferior, that that was obvious, universally agreed. They believed white South Africans knew better than the rest of the world. Just like in countries in which women do not have equal rights to men, people in those countries argue that the status of women is not up for debate, that the West is a cesspool because western societies allow people to debate anything, that in an ideal society freedom of speech requires curtailment. Ironically, in South Africa at the time, the one place you could hold the opposite view was on the University of the Witwatersrand campus, where there was academic freedom. When you take the position that there are subjects and views that are not acceptable under academic freedom then in fact you do not have academic freedom. This is not an academic point I am making. It is what is going on right now on this campus, as was so graphically illustrated at the Law School last quarter. I agree with the senators who proposed the motion that racism and sexism are abhorrent ideas. I am certain that every person on the Faculty Senate also agrees with this. Under my set of values, these ideas are abhorrent. But for the reasons I have already enunciated, I do not support censoring people so they cannot debate these ideas. But there is another reason, perhaps more important, not to censor debate or exclude people with these ideas. By censoring debate, you take away any opportunity to change the mind of the people with those views. Instead, you send the message that perhaps the reason you do not want to debate the ideas is that you cannot provide a logical argument opposing them. That is an exceedingly dangerous and destructive message. I want to debate those views precisely because I believe it is exceptionally simple to provide a logical argument why those views are incorrect. The stance that there are some subjects that cannot be debated removes my ability to make that argument. The arguments I have made in this opinion piece are not new. They were embodied in the Constitution of the United States over 200 years ago. I also do not think that they are particularly controversial. For more than a century the stakeholders of this institution have worked extremely hard to transform a small regional institution into what I would argue is the best university in the world. Part of that struggle was establishing the modern notion of academic freedom. Now that the preeminence has been achieved: the current stakeholders of Stanford have a choice that past stakeholders did not have. They can continue doing the hard work that is required to maintain the preeminence or they can sacrifice that preeminence for their own ends. This is not a hypothetical choice. Research and education cannot prosper in a world that does not consider ideas that run counter to prevailing wisdom. Without the notion of academic freedom that includes listening and debating not just pleasant but also unpleasant ideas, the quality of the institution cannot be maintained. The fight to maintain academic freedom at Stanford is the same fight to maintain preeminence."
stanforddaily_2023_66,"To the Stanford community and concerned individuals everywhere, We, the members of Stanford Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP , feel compelled to address the recent and ongoing injustices faced by the Palestinian people. As the world witnesses the atrocities committed in Palestine, it becomes increasingly clear that these events are not isolated incidents, but rather part of the protracted struggle against settler-colonial oppression. On Saturday, as a part of the ongoing,decades-longstruggle against Israeli oppression, Palestine forces attacked Israel. The media’s depiction of Saturday’s resistance as a one-off event is fundamentally reductionist: no conversation about Palestine can be conducted without the context of the decades of systematic oppression, discrimination and violence the Palestinian people have faced. Israel currently places a “land, water and air” siege on the Gaza Strip. Regularly cutting off water and electricity, Israel vindictively rules and occupies the Gaza Strip. Israel also regularlyforcesPalestinian produce to spoil rather than allowing it to pass through checkpoints to where it can be sold. Israel’s choice to lay siege to Gaza has caused Gaza to become an “open-air prison,” a term being used by the Human Rights Watch. These conditions should provoke all of us to take action and fight for safety in the world. We are embarrassed to live in a world that tolerates this level of consistent, systematic and unrelenting violence. The fact that people can be treated like this in the 21st century is a stain on our history. Palestinians, like all peoples, have the legitimate right to resist occupation, apartheid and systemic injustice. Saturday’s events underscore the structural violence, displacement and daily hardships Palestinians have faced for decades under a regime that seeks to undermine their basic human rights and dignity. It is essential for us as an academic community and as global citizens to recognize the roots of this conflict. While it might be easy for some to view the issue as a distant geopolitical dispute, the reality is far simpler. Western media will hail the Ukrainians who defend their homeland as valiant heroes; however, there is a distinct double standard at play when it comes to the resistance of the Palestinian people against the settler colonialists of Israel. Furthermore, while Palestinian resistanceislegal under international law, Israel’s breathtakingly violent actionsareillegal collective punishment under the Geneva Convention. For example, Israel’s destruction of Palestine Tower, a media and residential building,constitutesa war crime, since news and civilians are not legitimate military targetsunder U.N. law. At its core, this message is about an oppressed population striving for equality, freedom and self-determination in the face of systemic subjugation. We are dismayed by the fact that institutions like Stanford, which proclaim values of justice, equality and human rights, continue to be entangled with companies and entities that directly or indirectly support the machinery of this oppression. Our association with such entities not only undermines our collective values but also tacitly condones the perpetuation of this injustice. Furthermore, between 2008 and 2020, Palestinians haveendured96% of the total casualties resulting from the conflict, demonstrating the one-sided nature of the situation. We stand firmly with theBoycott, Divestment and Sanctionscampaign, echoing their call for immediate action to cease all military, security and technological collaboration with those implicated in the ongoing colonization of Palestine. We also demand an end to any partnerships with companies that actively participate in the dispossession of Palestinians. We recognize the strength and resilience of the Palestinian people, who, despite facing overwhelming odds, continue to rise and assert their undeniable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Their resistance is not just a testament to their spirit but also a reminder of the universality of the human desire for justice and freedom. Injustice anywhere hurts all of us. The fact that Palestinians must endure such brutal conditions is an embarrassment to the modern human condition. The only thing that Israeli apartheid has succeeded in doing is creating violence and misery, which can be heard all around the world. In solidarity with the Palestinian cause, we call upon the Stanford community and individuals everywhere to educate themselves, raise awareness and actively challenge complicity in this system of oppression. Justice for Palestine is justice for all. This article was written by Hamza El Boudali and other members of Stanford Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP leadership.

rice_thresher_2023_49,"ByThresher Editorial Board3/28/23 9:40pm Rice is raising tuition again. We’re not here to complain about it: We understand that inflation has impacted the university’s expenses. In fact, that’s actually why we’re writing this editorial — just as the university’s increased costs necessitate increasing tuition, we believe the impact inflation has on campus organizations also necessitates a slight increase in the Blanket Tax. For those that don’t know, part of each tuition payment is something called the Blanket Tax, a fee levied by the Student Association and distributed to a variety of student organizations. The Thresher is one of those organizations, alongside Rice Civic Duty, Rice Rally Club and Rice Program Council. That’s right, the Blanket Tax is how we pay for Beer Bike every year. Other campus events benefit from the Blanket Tax as well. This semester alone, the Blanket Tax and its initiative fund helped finance Africaye!, PERIOD Week, the Residential College Chess League, the HACER Banquet and the Korean Street Market, to name just a few. The Blanket Tax exists to serve students, but its current budgets and initiative funding don’t cover as much as they once did. In order for Blanket Tax Organizations to fulfill their primary goals, and in order to keep funding initiatives for other campus organizations, the Blanket Tax fee, which was set in 2015 to be $85 per student and would be equivalent to $109 today, needs to be increased. To be clear, we’re not necessarily calling for a large increase. Just a few more dollars, when multiplied by every student, would provide thousands of additional dollars for student organizations and events. While a minor increase wouldn’t solve the mounting threat that inflation poses to campus organizations, it would serve as a band-aid over the enlarging wound of rising costs. Alternatively, just as Rice raises its tuition by a little bit each year, the SA could consider slowly increasing the Blanket Tax by a dollar or two annually, avoiding larger one-time increases entirely, as with the previous fee raises. Rice would not be the same without its student organizations. As it stands, Blanket Tax Organizations are forced to focus on maintaining their current levels of operation and aren’t given the space to meet the desires or needs of the student body that funds them. A stagnant pool of available funding, increasing demand and rampant inflation are stifling creativity, growth and innovation. In order for student groups to grow and forge new paths, they need just a little more money. Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Ben Baker-Katz, Morgan Gage, Bonnie Zhao, Hajera Naveed, Nayeli Shad, Riya Misra, Michelle Gachelin, Daniel Schrager, Prayag Gordy and Brandon Chen. Editor-in-Chief Morgan Gage recused herself from this editorial due to her position on the Blanket Tax Committee. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

wildcat_arizona_2023_9,"Mary Ann Vagnerova Kate Herreras-ZinmanFebruary 28, 2023 I’m not on speaking terms with my father, and I wish that was viewed as normal. I haven’t been on speaking terms with him since May of this year, and it comes up surprisingly often. People do ask you about your parents when you’re in college, but those aren’t questions you think of as odd until you’ve cut a parent off. My father has been manipulative and angry for all of my life, but that was my normal. I had to go to a university he wanted me to go to. I had to do things just his way or he would freak out. For an entire week in high school, he even kicked me out of his house for saying “Fuck you,” which is just about the most normal teenage thing I can think of but, to him, it was an egregious offense. My father is diagnosed withAutism Spectrum Disorder, as am I. For him, that manifests in a lot of rigidity that shows him needing people to bend to what he wants. It’s something he never worked on. So one day, I reached a boiling point. I was using the last of a semester’s meal plan money to throw a random pizza party for some friends. This wouldn’t do; why should I spend money on something dumb and frivolous when I could save him money by inviting him to dinner on campus with me? He even said he’d like to use my phone so he could callPapa John’shimself. He kept pushing the subject, and I realized that it was too much for me. We haven’t really spoken since; I’ve blocked him on every platform, and the major turning point was very literally pizza. When it does come up that we’re not on speaking terms, people automatically assume the worst. People say “I’m so sorry.” People ask if it’s because I’m trans. I have to work up the courage to tell them that it’s a voluntary situation — that what I wish they’d say is “good for you!” I have to push down this urge to tell them off for assuming so many things about me. Yet, the situation is a far more common one than you’d think. I spoke to many people who wish this was less taboo — more than I could possibly include in an article. I put out a call on social media for anyone who’d been in this position — voluntarily not speaking with their parents — to speak to me. These are their stories. First, Elizabeth Sofley responded to myFacebook post looking for peopleto speak to about this subject promptly. Sofley and I used to be on an improvteam together, called Disaster Time, over Zoomduring the pandemic, and this was the first time we’d seen each other since. We spoke on Nov. 18. Sofley had cut off her mother and had a compelling response as to when. “My mom and I were like the Pam and Tommy of mother-daughter relationships. We were like together — apart — together — apart.” Sofley and her mother would go through periods of not speaking starting when Sofley was 14 years old. It was eleven years ago, at the age of 28, that Sofley cut her mother off for the final time. Having originally left her mother at such a young age, Sofley said, “There wasn’t a preparation to leave. It was more like when Sylvester is hanging on a pole and Tweety’s going ‘pleek-pleek-pleek-pleek,’” Sofley mimedTweety Bird plucking at Sylvester’s hand. She went to live with her grandmother at that time. When asked about people’s responses to her not being on speaking terms with her mother, Sofley told me “What would be nice is inclusivity. If someone were to do the math to realize ‘This person probably has a pretty lonely Thanksgiving,’ I think an invite to an event that promotes community would be a perfect response.” Second, Robert Becker responded to the aforementioned Facebook post. I’ve known Becker for years. He’s a friend of my mother. Becker is atravel agent and rock musician, having played with bands such asThe Gin Blossoms. We spoke over the phone first thing the following morning, the 19th. Becker first cut off his father at a young age, but they eventually got back in touch. “When my mother became ill, I wanted to present a united front with my brothers and me, and my father sent me an email saying that what I was doing was a very kind thing, and that resumed contact between us.” Becker says that, for a while, this went well. Eventually, however, things turned sour again. “He began to do things that were very homophobic, not directed so much at me as at my little brother who was much more vulnerable than I was; he didn’t have the support of other gay people.” Eventually, Becker got back in touch with his father through other family members. They’re still in contact today. He says his father recently pointed out how happy Becker seems. “We had lunch, and my dad said to me ‘The others did what was expected of them, but here we are forty years later, and you’re happier than any of them.’ That’s nice. I’m not interested in being compared to them, but at least he recognizes that I’m doing my own thing and learned how to be happy.” Becker gave me a list of the four books he felt influenced him in finding himself and learning how to be happy during his times of emotional turmoil:“Destructive Emotions” by Daniel Goleman and the Dalai Lama,“The Art of Loving” by Erich Fromm,“Man’s Search for Meaning” by Viktor Frankl, and“Wind, Sand and Stars” by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. He was specific to note that he keeps extra copies around of the last one to give to people because he believes that everyone should read it. He sent me a copy, and I look forward to reading it. The book, amemoir about early delivery piloting and its dangers, sounds as spiritually inspirational as Becker describes it, but the real inspiration came from receiving it in the mail: I’m not the only person who’s experienced this, not even the only person in my life. Third, I spoke with Jen Haskin. Haskin is a family member of a friend of mine. She reached out to me based on myInstagram post. She hasn’t spoken to her parents in over a year after cutting contact voluntarily. Haskin is also unique in regards to everyone else on this list and, as far as I know, anyone I’ve spoken to; she has Dissociative Identity Disorder. I had a Zoom meeting with her outside the Main Library a few hours after my conversation with Becker on the 19th. Dissociative identity disorder is something I have very little knowledge of or familiarity with. When I asked Haskin to describe it to me, I joked “I know it’s probably not an easy thing to explain, but right now my mind is going toMoon Knight, and I know it’s not that.” As much as I was trying to be playful, that was also completely true — everything I know about Dissociative Identity Disorder comes fromsuperhero fiction. Haskin explained it to me in terms I understood. “It’s like a form of compartmentalizing everything. If you think about a bookshelf, for instance, and how there’s just books on it but they each have their own story, that’s exactly how my mind is built, so there’s different personalities that contain different kinds of information and different parts of my life.” Haskin says that it was one big incident that led her to cut off her parents. “I discovered that I had childhood trauma and sent letters to both my mom and dad and basically told them I had been abused during my childhood, and, if they wanted to talk to me about it, they could follow some strict boundaries I had set with it. I wanted them to physically write me a letter, not just send me a text message or try to call me and talk their way out of it. I wanted them to think about it and process it. Both of them broke that boundary, so that moved me in the direction of cutting them off.” Dissociative identity disorder made the process of cutting a parent off hard for Haskin. “It was like fighting. There had to be a time when it was about the people who were hurt and didn’t want to talk to them anymore and not about the people who wanted to be in a relationship with them.” Haskin stressed that the decision still felt like an empowering one. “It still feels empowering, and I would tell anybody who felt like they wanted to do it to do it because, even if it was a struggle, I would stand behind that.” A takeaway to be had from these stories is that it’s not always a bad thing to not speak to your parents. It can be empowering. It can feel like a step in the right direction. It’s okay if your friend doesn’t speak to their parents, and it doesn’t feel good when people assume that’s a bad thing. If you want to express sympathy, just be there for your friends. If you’re anything like me, as I found when writing this piece, there are already plenty of people in your life who have cut off their parents. It’s just not something that we talk about because it’s so taboo, so maybe they just haven’t told you. Follow theDaily WildcatonTwitter Kate is a sophomore at the University of Arizona.

crimson_2023_46,"What is Harvard’s mission? Former University President Henry Dunster wrote our college’s first charter in 1650 in part to answer that question. In addition to establishing the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, the document outlines one of Harvard’s goals aseducating Indigenous studentsalongside white ones. In practice, however, Harvard’s history is entangled with violence, dispossession, and erasure of Indigenous communities. From the enslavement of Indigenous peoples, to the construction of a university on land that was already occupied, tothe continued commemorationof the names and faces of people who participated in these historical atrocities, Harvard has hardly been an ally of the Native American community. That history of dispossession traces back to Harvard’s early years and spreads beyond Massachusetts. For example, the Harvard Legacy of Slavery Report documents how Harvard treasurer Thomas Danforth personally sought out land for the University taken from the Pequot tribe in Rhode Island and Connecticut. This case was not an isolated incident but part of a larger norm when Harvard was developing and expanding: In the 1800s, the Harvard treasurer was a mediator over a decades-long land dispute over a Harvard-owned 300-acre lot in Bucksport, Maine. Today, our university owns nearly 10 percent of all land in Cambridge androughly one-third of the Allston neighborhood.All of that area is the homeland of the Massachusett Tribe. Needless to say, the impact of Harvard’s dispossession in the area is large and still relevant today. Harvard has failed to live up to the laudable goal of Indigenous education in its charter. The historical Indian College building was constructed in 1655, only enrolled five Native students, and was dismantled by 1690. Now, Matthews Hall stands where the bricks of the Indian College were once laid. Given this legacy and its relevance to the present, Harvard has a responsibility to reconcile with Native communities. In 2017, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head — the same nation that the first Native American graduates of Harvard, Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck and Joel Iacoomes, were members of — issued a joint resolution calling on Harvard to keep the promise of the 1650 charter through commitments to Indigenous communities and students. In hopes of strengthening the relationship between Harvard and the tribes, the resolution called on Harvard to recognize tribal sovereignty, increase recruitment and retention of Indigenous students, and hire Native American and other underrepresented minority faculty and staff. The process of atoning for Harvard’s settler colonial history can only move forward if the University centers Indigenous voices, stories, and requests. While such an approach is self-evident to many, I don’t think Harvard has consistently shown up for Indigenous communities. Harvard ought to consider a wide range of reparative steps. For instance, though the University has started a formal review of the proposal to dename Winthrop House, this process needs more transparency and urgency. Harvard’s museums must also clarify and expedite the process toreturn Indigenous remainsback to their communities. Harvard also should examine ideas that would be more logistically challenging but surely worthwhile, like offering full financial aid to the descendants of tribes harmed by our institution, surrendering some land owned by the University outside of Cambridge to tribes, and ensuring that all administrators are thoroughly educated about the violence Harvard has inflicted upon Indigenous communities throughout history. Our University’s promise to Indigenous communities in the original charter remains unkept. Making good on this vow will be a fluid and time-consuming process, but Harvard cannot waste a moment. Only by addressing its past can Harvard create a better future for its Indigenous students and foster reconciliation with affected tribes. Zion J. Dixon ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a joint concentrator in History and Literature and African and African American Studies in Winthrop House.

stanforddaily_2023_8,"This week, Stanford’s graduate students joined the nationwide movement for the unionization of academic workers. After years of organizing the University’snearly 10,000 graduate students, graduate student workers announced plans to unionize, marking the occasion with a rally and thousands of signed cards. This year has already been marked by major actions by the graduate body at Stanford: the Graduate Student Council (GSC , for example, held a momentousVote of No Confidencein the administration and circulated apetitionto demand support from Stanford on skyrocketing affordability issues. The move to unionize and create a legal structure for graduate student representation is an immense step in building power to make much-needed changes. It’s a cause for celebration that our teaching and course assistants who shape our undergraduate experience can better advocate for pay raises and researchers can campaign for improved conditions. Stanford graduate students are in one of the most precarious positions of all graduate workers in the country — the affordability crisis in the Bay Area, with which we are all intimately familiar, has dramatically pushed up housing prices and living costs to an unlivable point for many. Graduate students earn around 50k per year, based onStanford’s minimum salary dataand Graduate Student Solidarity Network reports, which classifies them asvery low income in Santa Clara County. According to graduate organizer and PhD student in East Asian Languages and Cultures Kat Whatley, most Stanford graduate student workers are paying well over the federally recommended30% of income limit for monthly rent, making them rent-burdened. These conditions mean graduate students who are not single, childless and debt-free are extremely squeezed financially and often cannot choose to conduct research and further their educations at Stanford at all. This is unacceptable, particularly when these student workers are employed by one of therichest universitiesin the world. Unionization has the potential to change this, improving not only the lives of graduate students but also our lives and education as undergraduates. While graduate students face some unique challenges, many of their concerns are shared by the entire student body and the Stanford community as a whole. The unaffordability of on and off campus housing squeezes all of our finances. The dearth of free, expansive, accessible transportation makes all of our lives on campus more difficult. Lack of diversity in the graduate student body constrains the knowledge and experience that we all can learn from in our courses and research. Our central concerns are shared. Affordability is a central field of collective concern across all levels of the student body. High rents for graduate students dissuade undergraduates from pursuing postgraduate education at Stanford — who but those without student debt and financial obligations can afford rents that are often 50% or more of graduate salaries — and mirrorrising undergraduate housing coststhat put many students in a financial bind. Both undergraduate and graduate students can rarely elect to live in cheaper housing because it simply doesn’t exist at Stanford (the average rent in Palo Alto is$3,485 a month . Our undergraduate student body has an extremely high percentage of students living on campus despite students not being required to live here — around98% of us live in University housing— largely because there is so little affordable housing off campus, severely constraining housing options, and many students on financial aid do not receive the support they need to pay for housing on campus. Graduate students too are disproportionately constrained toon-campus housing,unlike most graduate students at other peer institutions, and as mentioned above are often rent-burdened by housing costs in University apartments. Graduate organizers have thus established that housing affordability is a central concern of the union effort, committing to fighting for affordable housing on campus. Unionization could transform the field from which students can advocate for University changes around affordability, building precedent for more affordable undergraduate housing and making graduate studies at Stanford more accessible to current undergraduates. These shared benefits are also quite clear in issues of transportation. With wide-reaching ramifications for affordability, equity and safety, Marguerite expansion has been one of the most discussed issues of the year. Without these lines and a holistic, accessible transit system, both undergraduate and graduate students struggle to find safe transportation at night, access resources like grocery stores and pharmacies and get off campus with the same ease as students with cars. Students have fought to reinstate pre-COVID lines, extend hours and make transportation generally more accessible. Just a couple of weeks ago, after an aligned push from theUndergraduate Senate(UGS andGSC, administrators announced that they were considering piloting a return of the Shopping Express line. When this wasconfirmedat a GSC meeting, members said that they would continue to champion full reinstatement. A graduate student union could be extremely powerful in this effort as a legal entity that can push for these demands. Low wages for teaching assistantships and research positions, inaccessible and expensive mental and physical healthcare resources, and public safety systems that fail to protect us and instead target communities of color are among other concerns the union has the potential to transform. All are critical issues on campus, and steps by administration to ease them have been minimal. These shared priorities are already targets of joint resolutions between the GSC and UGS, but resolutions alone don’t always lead to change. A union can be a more powerful force that the University must take seriously. Union organizers have also expressed excitement when it comes to partnerships with undergraduates on unique concerns for us as well, committing to support us on our biggest issues. To undergraduates reading this, do not give weight to fear-mongering that a graduate student union will be bad for us in any way. Claims that increasing graduate pay or subsidizing their housing will increase costs for undergraduates is a scare tactic to divide us —Stanford has the resourcesto do right by all of its students. Building student democracy through collective bargaining on the graduate level is an opportunity for all of us to grow our power in shaping Stanford. This is a long fight, and our public support is crucial to the union campaign’s success. To learn more about the union, please visitthe union’s website.

crimson_2023_102,"For Kurds in the homeland and diaspora, the scent of apples is one that, especially during the month of March, revives scars from the past. For those of us who grew up hearing stories about the Halabja Massacre of March 16, 1988, we are familiar with the narrative of late dictator Saddam Hussein’s use of chemical weapons, which smelled strongly of sweet apples, to gas this Kurdish city, ultimately claiming the lives of 5,000 people. 2023 marks 35 years since the deadly attack on the city, yet the lasting implications of the attack are still affecting Kurds across the world. Many survivors and their children deal with both psychological and physical consequences, such as respiratory illnesses. Moreover, the denial of the massacre, the continued idealization of Ba’athism (the political ideology of Saddam Hussein and Bashar al-Assad of Syria , and the persistent occupation of Kurdistan are all alive and rampant in the Middle East and in diasporic communities. As a student of Kurdish and Syrian-Arab heritage, I have grappled with the reality of these two conflicting identities for years. In Arab spaces especially, I have tried to amplify the stories of Kurdistan as much as possible. While there are many in my community who have expressed support and advocated for Kurdistan, I have noticed the lasting effects of bigotry and tribalism still taking place in our own campus spaces. Whether defending songs that mourn Saddam Hussein, chanting the Farsi translation of “jin, jiyan, azadi” without crediting its Kurdish origin, or claiming that a Kurdish state will only cause chaos in the Middle East, many on campus have reminded me that being Kurdish in diaspora does not make me immune to the erasure and oppression people in Kurdistan face. Many who praise Saddam Hussein as an “anti-imperialist,” pro-unity leader forget that the attack on Halabja was not possible without the help of Western forces including the United States. CIA files prove that the United States gave military and monetary aid to Saddam Hussein the same year he committed the attack against Halabja. Yet there are always excuses to back the oppressive dictator despite the Anfal Campaign, his genocide against the Kurds of modern-day northern Iraq. There is a famous Kurdish proverb that goes, “We have no friends but the mountains.” This phrase has always been symbolic of the repeated neglect and abandonment of Kurds by other communities in the midst of their oppression. The mountains have always been a place of refuge for Kurds — much unlike their neighbors — concealing them from the armies and fighters who work to ethnically cleanse Kurdish cities, towns, and villages. Remembering my mother’s stories of childhood under the Saddam Hussein regime in Halabja, I am filled with anger each time I hear someone claiming Saddam Hussein was a good leader “besides the Kurdish issue.” I, along with the millions of other Kurds across the world, am tired of having our stories brushed off to the side. There should be no “besides.” Occupation does not vanish our population; it does not erase our stories, our culture, or our language. Our land. Occupation does not erase Kurdistan. This is why we continue to speak. Because attempts at ethnically cleansing Kurds still persist today. Just a few weeks ago, on Kurdish Clothing Day, Iraqi forces guarding the entrance to a university in the disputed city of Kirkuk denied entry to Kurds wearing traditional clothing. Kirkuk, an oil-rich city, has been subjected to land grabs by the Iraqi government as well as an Arabization campaign with roots in the Saddam Hussein regime. Around the same time, on March 20, the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (formerly known as the “Free Syrian Army” shot and killed four members of a Kurdish family celebrating Newroz, the new year and spring solstice. These are just a few of the many attacks on Kurdish people under their occupying states. From Rojava (“Syrian” Kurdistan to Rojhelat (“Iranian” Kurdistan , the occupation poisons Kurdish society the same way Saddam poisoned Halabja. History is repeating itself through the erasure, gaslighting, and silencing of Kurdish people in the diaspora. I have seen this in my own experiences on campus, a disheartening example of how harmful ideologies like pan-Arabism and Ba’athism have left a lasting impression on both diasporic and homeland communities. But despite the displacement of our people and the dispossession of our land, we still resist. We celebrate Newroz in our vibrant traditional clothing and dance the halparke. We yell “jin, jiyan, azadi” even when our occupiers try to take this phrase away from us. We raise our Kurdish flag higher and higher, we preserve our mountains to reaffirm our connection to our lands, and we tell the stories of our people. We say we are Kurdish — not Iraqi, Syrian, Turkish, or Iranian. Our freedom rests on the preservation of our cultures, the rise against our occupying powers, and the storytelling of our past. I truly believe that one day, we will no longer be silenced, but liberated. One day, it will no longer be considered “divisive” or “provocative” for me to say that I am both Kurdish and Arab. One day, others will see that my two ethnic identities do not oppose each other, but work to uplift one another. I know that soon, others around the world who work to understand Kurdistan’s history and reality will join the mountains in supporting us. Dalal Hassane ’26 lives in Matthews Hall."
crimson_2023_0,"Several hundred students have spent the last few days urging Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorfto resignbecause he did something that was, well, entirely within his purview — Elmendorfvetoed the appointmentof Kenneth Roth as a fellow at the school’s Carr Center of Human Rights, and Roth subsequently claimed the veto was due to his “criticism of Israel.” Roth, the so-called “godfather” of human rights and former executive director of the nonprofit Human Rights Watch, spearheaded the transformation of HRW into an organization that has helped “turn Israel into a pariah state,” according to its founder Robert L. Bernstein ’44, who has since condemned the organization’s shift. I find it amusing that the signatories in this letter think they are entitled to demand his resignation. Not everyone is entitled to a fellowship purely in the name of free speech, and Dean Elmendorf has the procedural right to not select someone. While it is true that Dean Elmendorf’s reasoning is likely linked to Roth’s stances on Israel, this decision is not an attempt by the dean to block all anti-Israel perspectives. How do I know this? Well, the proof is in the pudding. The reality is that the Kennedy School and Harvard University writ large already feature an array of anti-Israel voices at the faculty, fellow, and student levels, who have been provided with ample support from HKS and the University: Fellows have included former Palestinian Liberation Organization spokesperson Diana Buttu, while HKS hosted a controversial 2012 “One State Solution” conference that was partially sponsored by the Weatherhead Center and the Office of the Provost, to name only a few examples. Dean Elmendorf never seems to have banned any of these people from discussing their views on Israel, nor has he ever publicly taken an explicitly pro-Israel stance, nor, as far as I can recall, has anyone else in the current Harvard administration, and so it would be hard to claim Dean Elmendorf is just a mouthpiece for the pro-Israel camp. What is also laughable is that the cohort advocating for Dean Elmendorf’s resignation on the grounds that his decision goes against “principles underpinning free thought in a free society” is part of the same group of organizations that has continually protested about the presence of pro-Israel speakers on campus. Many of the most vociferous among those who authored and signed this letter — particularly the Palestine Solidarity Committee and the HKS Palestine Caucus — are the same people who have supported theBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, which calls for Harvard to divest from any investments in Israeli companies, and who have called on students toboycott Israel Trek, a privately sponsored trip to Israel exploring the conflict from multiple perspectives. The PSC, for instance, refused to have a conversation with one of Israel Trek’s student leaders to preserve “the comfort level and safety of the Palestinian students” since the fact that some of the trip’s organizers were former Israeli Defense Forces soldiers created a“power imbalance.”But since Israel has a draft, nearly every Israeli student has served in the IDF. A similar letter from the ​​HKS Palestinian Alumni Collective calling on Dean Elmendorf to resign also says the school should not invite any speakers or fellows who “bear responsibility for war crimes perpetrated against Palestinians, including the crime of apartheid, a crime against humanity” — a phrase that, given the IDF draft, could be taken to imply that almost all Israeli citizens are guilty of war crimes, which would suggest that no dialogue should be had with any Israeli fellow or student. Pro-Israel voices, on the other hand, do not seem to be particularly welcome, through efforts like the push to boycott Israel Trek. Last spring,Amos Yadlin’s study groupwas met with consistent protests and a call from the PSC for students to “deplatform Yadlin’s troubling presence,” while Israeli ambassadorMichael Herzog’s visit to the schoolwas interrupted and overrun with student protesters. At every turn, it seems as if pro-Israel voices are not permitted to speak. You don’t see the organizations who called on Dean Elmendorf to resign advocating on behalf of free speech on these occasions, and so one can only conclude that their invocation of the principle in their letter is disingenuous — it seems, instead, to be anger that anti-Israel voices are not welcomed with open arms at every juncture. Even if Roth’s rejection is in part related to his views on Israel, it is not a violation of free speech for Dean Elmendorf to decide that a fellow who will just regurgitate already-existing notions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is extraneous. That so many students and student organizations have signed this letter is proof that Harvard students do not need another fellow reinforcing their views rather than encouraging discourse and debate. I hope Dean Elmendorf can use his platform going forward to bring in a fellow who can challenge the campus’s distorted conception of this conflict — say, a fellow discussing Israel’s role as the only democracy in the Middle East, with Arab and Muslim minority representation in its government, and by far the country in the region most accepting of the LGBTQ+ community. I would challenge every signatory on this letter to attend this fellow’s study group in support of, as they put it, “academic freedom.” Our campus discourse about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be nuanced and informative.

stanforddaily_2023_31,"I saw the emergency alert pointing to a 7.7 earthquake in my home country on Sunday evening. Turkey lies on several fault lines, but I thought it had to be a typo. 15 minutes later, my Twitter feed was flooded with cries for help: “I’m here at this address, save me. I can’t breathe and my brother’s unconscious,” said one tweet. “My mother lives in this apartment, please find her, someone please go check on her,” said another, “I’m under the rubble and it’s freezing, I don’t know where my family is.” After days of failed search and rescue, most of the people on my feed were dead. The first 48 hours were the worst part, as the people who called Turkey and Syria home waited while search and rescue efforts failed. It snowed on tens of thousands of my people until they died of hypothermia. We watched it happen live, on Twitter, as they begged the government, or anyone, to save them. I’ve never felt so desperate. I begged publicly on Instagram for donations maybe a hundred times while Stanford’s official Instagram account shared celebratory images of “Flower Friday at White Plaza.” That same Friday, during those Valentine’s Day celebrations at White Plaza, we were collecting donations for survivors a few feet away. No one around me knew about the earthquakes until I had told them. I have lost weight, cried through my classes, felt sick and lost sleep. Many other Turkish and Syrian students have been affected in the same way, as we wait and hope the death toll won’t reach 200,000. People who knew would look at me and tell me I “look tired” or ask me if I’ve had “a long night out” despite knowing that I’m from Turkey. None of my professors reached out before I told them I was affected. Although Markaz and Bechtel have been very sensitive and helpful, they are only able to reach a select few Muslim and international students and can’t spread awareness among the rest of the student body. When people hear my perspective, they tell me they never knew it was this bad. This is because of Stanford’s tardy and nonchalant statement that only showed a death toll statistic, sent out five days after the earthquake. We reached out to the Dean’s Office numerous times before that to no avail. Those around us were left to think there was nothing that should cause disruption in our lives. For what may be the most devastating crisis of the decade, we had expected all of our professors to send out announcements to their classes and offer their support. What Stanford decides to prioritize as an emergency worth telling its community has severe consequences. Does it not affect faculty caring about their students, awareness within our student body, and where donations from influential people go? We have a non-negligible Turkish and Syrian student body who worked and grieved tirelessly all week, and our expectations from Stanford were far higher than what we were given. This negligence is even more hurtful when I think about those who have lost more than I have. Here’s a quote from my friend Abdul Omira ’23: “My community back home is torn apart. I lost a few extended family members so far, as well as seven childhood friends, and the rest of my family and friends are displaced again with nowhere to go. I had an assignment due. Literally no Stanford officials reached out.” The Stanford community is full of kind students and compassionate faculty, and Stanford failed to give them the opportunity to understand and respond quickly to our situation. Part of Abdul’s extended family lives in Antakya, Turkey. They moved there after the start of the war in Syria. I met Abdul when I coincidentally saw him post about his family and friends in Antakya on Instagram. He was looking for a crane to dig his family out — they were still hearing their voices from under the rubble, but there was a chance they wouldn’t make it. After finding a friend who had contact with rescue teams in the region, I waited to see if Abdul’s family could be saved. They had heard their voices three hours prior, but time was running out. The next morning, I saw a text from my friend: “Don’t text him. They found their corpses. He knows.” Abdul reached out to me later that day and told me that while his relatives had died in that building, the team we sent there found a little girl alive. “Just the fact that we found that child is enough for our whole family,” he told me. I was crushed by his heartfelt response, as well as how no official channels from Stanford even offered their condolences despite having him on record as a Syrian citizen. “I think if Stanford had put together a more robust way of getting us together, we would have been a few hours early,” said Abdul. Although we can never know, I wish I had known about his situation as soon as the crisis hit and not three days after. Delaying this news points to a massive disregard for our mental well-being. It shows us that we’re seen as second-tier world citizens and a negligible part of the Stanford Community. It shows us that it is okay to wait five days to acknowledge our suffering when we’ve been doing everything we can to send money back home. Had Stanford acknowledged the magnitude of the earthquake during these first five days, we could have saved more people and received sympathy for being unable to do our academic work. During times like this, “I’m trying to be okay. How about you?” is a common way to respond when asked how we’re doing. I’m trying to be okay with what happened back home, but I’m not okay with how Abdul, I and all other Turkish and Syrian students are being treated on this campus. I beg Stanford to try not to dismiss their failure just for the sake of preserving the school’s image, and I urge other students in similar situations who’ve been neglected in the past to speak out. Finally, I ask you all — students, alumni, and faculty— to let me borrow your voices and show that this level of negligence won’t be tolerated in our community. For those of you who have reached out to your Turkish and Syrian friends or students, tried to help alleviate their responsibilities, and taken the time to learn about the magnitude of what had happened, thank you.

stanforddaily_2023_46,"On Oct. 7, Hamas blew up sections of the border fence around the Gaza Strip. Its fightersenterednearby Israeli towns and farming villages withwritten ordersto kill every civilian they could find — men, women, children and even babies — except for some to be captured as bargaining chips. They did as instructed, killing over 1,200 and taking over 240 hostage. The dead were later found raped, tortured, butchered and sometimes beheaded. Caught by surprise, Israelis quickly regrouped, halting the rampage and clearing the invaders from their territory. They rescued survivors and brought medical care to the many gravely wounded. Israel then launched a counterattack, first with bombing, and then, after careful preparation, with a ground assault. This conflict has brought a battle of words and slogans to Stanford and to campuses across the country. Most blame not the aggressor, Hamas, but its victim, Israel. President Richard Saller and his counterparts elsewhere have issued multiple statements and calls for dialogue, to little effect. Here I discuss examples in which the meaning of legal terms are twisted for emotional impact, and shouted chants replace civil discourse. Prominently, signs on campus have called Israel’s actions “genocide,” a word I see as a hand grenade tossed as an inversion of the Holocaust. When Nazi Germany killed fully one third of all the Jews in the world, the word “genocide” wasinventedto describe this evil, an attempt to intentionally destroy an entire group of people. Israel, on the other hand, wants to kill Hamas’ fighters, and the killing of soldiers in an enemy army is expected and permitted in war. Israel is not trying to kill everyone in Gaza but to free its hostages and remove Hamas from power. Protesters at Stanford deny Israel’s right to exist within any borders at all, calling its creation “settler-colonialism.” This concept may properly describe the English landing at Plymouth Rock. However, when applied to Israel, it is a loaded term that sweeps aside 3,200 years of Jewish history in which an indigenous people have re-established their ancient homeland after the invasions of successive empires, including one 1,400 years ago that brought Arabic and Islam from the Arabian Peninsula. Israelis’ and Palestinians’ long-standing claims to the land can be reconciled only by co-existence, but the chants we hear at demonstrations, including at Stanford, leave little room for that. “From the Jordan river to the Mediterranean sea, Palestine will be free” translates to “it’s all ours” — no Israel, no Jews. How? “Globalize theintifada” provides an answer — violence, against Israelis and against Jews everywhere. This assault of loaded words continues with accusations of Israeli “war crimes.” The laws of war include the rule of “proportionality,” which states that the legality of a military action depends on the balance between its objective and its means and consequences. Under prior law and the Rome Statute that governs the International Criminal Court, a “war crime” includes “intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects … which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated.” Causing civilian deaths is not itself a war crime, nor does proportionality require that deaths on both sides must be roughly equal. Critics denounce Israel’s response as “disproportionate” and therefore a “war crime.” But to determine the validity of these accusations we must closely examine whether Israel has properly delineated what is “proportionate” from what is “excessive.” Consider the battlefield. Hamas intentionallysitedcommand centers, arms factories and weapons depots in crowded civilian areas. Many line their 300-mile network of tunnels, with fighters descending through access shafts hidden in homes and hospitals. Rockets are launched outside mosques and schools. A Hamas headquarters is beinguncoveredin tunnels under Al Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest. Hamas chose these strategic locations to protect itself behindhuman shields(which is itself a war crime . To achieve “military advantage” from attacking its hidden enemy while reducing “incidental loss of civilian life or injury to civilians,” Israelwarnedcivilians to evacuate. Even so, there have been many deaths, as the critics properly point out.Hamas sourcesclaim that Israel has killed about16,000, without distinguishing civilians from combatants. By Israel’s estimate, the deaths include5,000or more Hamas fighters (over 30% of the total . Compare this to other urban battles, where combatants typically constitute only10%of the dead. Of course, the dead care little for statistics. But once an attacker starts a war, the defender may do only what is necessary and proportionate to end the threat. In this ugly context, Israel has satisfied the test of proportionality and has undermined the protesters’ accusation of war crimes. Next, consider the demonstrators’ call for “an immediate ceasefire.” This slogan also makes fine emotional rhetoric but lacks critical context. The slogan overlooks the ceasefire that wasalready in effect on Oct. 6. Even as it was signed last May, Hamas was deep intoplanning this meticulous attack. That ceasefire was only ahudna, a temporary truce, to be broken when convenient. Moreover, Hamas still holds over 130 hostages, and it is unlikely that Israel will get them back alive without military pressure. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar even threatened that Oct. 7 was “a rehearsal” for future attacks. Thispatternhas recurredevery few yearsin a loop, like some bloody version of “Groundhog Day.” How could another ceasefire break this loop? Israel now says the war will continue until all hostages are freed and Hamas is removed from its misrule of Gaza. Perhaps new, responsible leadership, under international supervision, will at last support the people of Gaza. Perhaps the Israeli government’s scandalous neglect of security before the attack will lead to an investigation, a new election and a new Israeli government too. The parties might then grope toward the dim light of co-existence, glinting in the distance at the end of this tunnel. Finally, here at Stanford, loud rhetoric that offers more heat than light coarsens debate on campus. After this war, perhaps we will stop shouting offensive slogans and return to learning from one another through reasoned and informed dialogue.

crimson_2023_31,"I’ve already worn my first sweater of the school year, and it’s gotten cold enough for me to comfortably wear hoodies to bed. The skies appear much darker than this past summer’s, and I often look outside to shadows instead of people. My shoes have been soaked through by unexpected rain, and my backpack has seemingly permanent wet spots from my umbrella. As movies and outings turn into problem sets and essays, it’s easy to let the gradual tide of turning weather pull us under. We make long, dark walks for late-night office hours, often alone and stressed, shivering and wishing we could just understand our homework from the comfort of our rooms. For many, nighttime walks are filled with unease, the dark doing little to comfort our already anxious minds. During the day, countless classrooms lack natural lighting, leaving us with the pale yellow glow of artificial bulbs to agitate our already existing headaches. It’s no secret that, despite the excitement of future snow and cozy clothes, the colder months can have serious effects on our well-being. The loss of natural light affects our circadian rhythms, and in turn thelevel of available serotoninin our brains. Some of us experience trouble sleeping, mood variations, or a mix of both. In more extreme cases,seasonal affective disordersprings depression upon around 5 percent of the American population in colder months. Seasonal depression is more common up north, where we live, likely due to the more noticeable seasonal changes. Studies have also shown thatstudents who come from less seasonal areasare at higher risk of developing symptoms of depression in the winter, meaning we may want to pay closer attention to some of our international and southern peers during these chilly times. Natural light is a generally good thing, as most of us know. People who chronically receive less sunlight showmore fatigue and symptoms of depressionon average, whereas greater outdoor exposure is associated with less anxiety. But do any of us really prioritize getting enough light for ourselves? As we walk from lecture to section to seminar, we get exposure to natural light for only eight or so minutes at a time. If we’re lucky, we enter a small Science Center room with one large window for everyone to see out of; if we’re not, we are left in one of Harvard’s various basements. The preservation of Harvard’s ancient buildings has left many of us learning in classrooms with dim interiors, lit only by harsh fluorescents. Even the notably more modern-looking Science Center houses countless classrooms without windows. There is no easy fix for what unavoidably happens every year. We can’t stop the cold weather from creeping in, and with the current state of our climate, we shouldn’t seriously want to, either. So what is there to do? I am not telling Harvard to strip down its historical buildings to construct new ones — though they certainly have the money to add more windows. Rather, I am emphasizing our need to make the most out of the sunlight we already rarely get. Light isn’t going to magically cure us of the stressors of college life; it’s not going to take away our deadlines, our overflowing calendars, or our worries for the future. But prioritizing a little extra sunlight is still worth a shot. The shifting weather is far too strong for my words to hold a solution, but I can still offer a small piece of advice. Try to take in the sunlight as many times as you can when the sun is still up and people are still milling about. Do homework near big windows, and, if you can, take your calls outside. Your body, and mind, might thank you. April S. Keyes ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Winthrop House."
stanforddaily_2023_11,"Today, after many years of graduate student organizing, Stanford graduate workers will finally get the chance to join many of our peer institutions and unionize. This is a great day to be a graduate student at Stanford. Although we have talked to many of you face-to-face, you may still reasonably ask: what does the Stanford Graduate Workers Union stand for? How will my needs and concerns be addressed by joining a union? In response to these excellent questions, we share our platform below and invite you tovisit our union website hereor attend a union information session on April 6 at 6:30 p.m. in EVGR B 144. These are only some of the things for which we stand; this list will only continue to evolve as the union grows to hear and represent every graduate worker on campus. As Stanford graduate workers, we know that Stanford works because we do. We conduct research and teaching integral to the University’s operation, reputation, and mission. We also know, however, that as graduate workers almost all of us are forced to navigate unjust working conditions in some form during our academic careers at Stanford. SGWU is fighting for a union because the problems we face as graduate workers are solvable. We believe that the ability to engage in collective bargaining with the University administration — in other words, participation in the decision-making that affects us — will help us build a Stanford where all graduate workers can thrive. Our proposed platform, which consists of five core points, emerged from the preliminary results of the Institutional Research & Decision Support (IR&DS Expenses Survey (AY 2022-23 , the Graduate Student Council (GSC Summer Affordability Survey and Bill on Affordability(October 2022 , the GSCpetition(February 2023 , the results of the IR&DSPh.D. Exit Survey, theIDEAL Survey, and thousands of conversations between workers over recent years. This proposed platform, inspired bythe gains of other graduate worker unions, is just a starting point. Stanford’s graduate workers will democratically decide what to fight for through a bargaining survey disseminated before contract negotiations. Ultimately, by participating in this process, graduate workers gain democratic decision-making power in two ways: We build a union that is by us and for us, in which each graduate worker has a voice, and we secure the ability to demand greater fairness, transparency, and democracy in the University operations that impact nearly every aspect of our lives. SGWU will fight for: As the GSC has made cleartimeandtime again, Stanford graduate workers are, and have been for some time, subject to an acute affordability crisis. This crisis disproportionately affects international and immigrant workers, parents, first-generation students, and workers from low-income backgrounds. The Universityrecently announcedthat its AY 2023-24 minimum assistantship stipend will be $50,616. This figure falls significantly below the“Very Low Income Limit”of $59,000 for a 1-person household in Santa Clara County established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD in FY 2022.* This will be thethird consecutive yearthat our salaries have not kept pace with inflation — in other words, our real wages have gone down each year for the last three years. Meanwhile,Stanford’s cost of living calculationsshow that in AY 2023-24, approximately 48% of our stipends will go to rent; we graduate workers know that, for many of us, this figure is significantly higher.** This percentage has increased steadily over the last decade: In 2013,it was just over 40%. Stanford is our employer and often our landlord. We live in an area with one of the highest costs of living in the country, and the math just isn’t that complicated. We need a living wage, annual raises that match the rising cost of housing and inflation rates, public transportation and parking subsidies, an expansion of Marguerite shuttle routes and schedules, the elimination of graduate worker fees, and housing that is actually affordable. We recommend that Stanford reduce rents charged by Residential and Dining Enterprises (R&DE , asgraduate housing in particular is subsidized by taxpayers via property tax waivers. We emphasize that the needs of graduate workers and faculty are often mutually aligned. We advocate for the elimination or reduction of graduate tuition, a decrease in overhead costs, and the elimination of Terminal Graduation Registration (TGR tuition. By minimizing the tuition rates charged to principal investigators, external grants will be able to support increased labor and material costs. A living wage is a critical step on the path to achieving racial and class-based equity, which are persistentlyskewedin many Stanford doctoralprograms. *As the GSC has pointed out, the margin between Stanford’s minimum assistantship stipend and the region’s “Very Low Income Limit” as stipulated by HUD far outpaces the corresponding margins for Stanford’s peer institutions. **The federal government defines a household as “rent burdened”when more than 30% of its income goes to rent and as “severely rent burdened” when more than 50% of its income goes to rent. More than one in three respondents to theIR&DS Expenses Surveyreported that they had foregone medical, dental, or vision care because they could not afford it. Many of us have had the experience of having our requests for reimbursement for medical expenses from the Emergency Grant-in-Aid fund rejected arbitrarily, or of struggling to obtain adequate mental healthcare. Meanwhile, theGraduate Family Grantfund provides each household with up to $20,000 in support, even though, as the GSC notes, the cost of childcarealonein our area ranges from$20,400 to $28,880. These conditions render graduate work and academic professions significantly less accessible to all of us, and especially to those with chronic illnesses and disabilities. There is currently no recognition of rights for graduate workers with disabilities asmandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act(ADA , and Office of Accessible Education (OAE policy changes are difficult to track. The University must provide full dental and vision coverage, expand mental healthcare options, increase the number of mental healthcare workers at Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS so that every graduate worker has access to a therapist they trust, offer health insurance for dependents at no additional cost, eliminate the Vaden Health Fee, grant at least one quarter of paid medical leave with guaranteed placement in housing, and allow graduate workers to enroll in a retirement plan. Moreover, we need parental leave for graduate workers, lactation rooms, and access to subsidized child and elder care. Comprehensive benefits have been shown to contribute togender inclusion and equity, which are persistentlyskewedin many Stanford doctoralprograms. The results of theIDEAL Surveydemonstrated that power abuse, harassment, and discrimination are rampant at Stanford — and that these issues are magnified for those of us who hold one or more marginalized identities. All too often, we are left with few to no good options for resolving situations that impede our ability to do our work and cause us physical and psychological harm, as institutional channels for reporting are often designed to protect the University instead of us. As a result, our experiences end in silencing, intimidation, and retaliation rather than justice, transformation, and healing. We need a fair, efficient, and effective grievance procedure through which graduate workers can choose to resolve power abuse, harassment, discrimination, and retaliation issues with the support of a union advocate; a neutral, third-party arbiter in cases in which the graduate worker and union advocate are unable to come to an agreement with the University; union representation in disciplinary proceedings; clear, transparent standards for disciplinary proceedings themselves; and collectively negotiated contingency plans for graduate workers when a supervisor is publicly accused of abuse. In addition, Stanford must improve its policies around race, gender, and disability justice, and we should have a say in the development of these policies. We will fight for improvements to our work conditions, including the maximum research and teaching load that can be required of graduate workers by their supervisors, professional feedback and development, and performance evaluation.Stanford Ph.D. students rankthe availability of faculty, program structure and requirements, and work commitments as the top three most significant obstacles to academic progress. We need professional workplace standards to remedy these problems. International and immigrant students constitute a significant portion of the graduate worker body, yet those of us who are not U.S. citizens face significant logistical and financial barriers that interfere with our work on a daily basis. We will fight for reimbursements for visa fees, a grievance procedure for graduate workers who have been unjustly terminated and fear deportation, improved legal resources as well as tax and immigration counseling for international and immigrant workers and their dependents, paid leave for immigration hearings and foreign elections, flexibility for workers returning to their home country to visit loved ones or renew visas, strengthened resources for workers navigating culture shock and a lack of community, and the University’s promise not to allow entry or provide information to governmental agencies about graduate workers for the purposes of detention or deportation based on immigration status. Despite the fact that the research and teaching we provide are indispensable to Stanford, we exercise little power in Stanford’s decision-making processes. The GSC supports unionization because its recommendations are consistently dismissed and ignored, and are in no way binding for administrators. As the GSC noted in itsrecent petition, this year the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education promised to consult the GSC before setting the minimum graduate assistantship stipend for AY 2023-24, only to next contact the GSC 48 hours after publicly announcing that stipend. Stanford must guarantee graduate worker representation at all levels of the University, including seats on the full Board of Trustees. Graduate workers must hold voting power on the issues that affect them, which include everything ranging from graduate housing to the University’s investments to campus safety policy.

crimson_2023_122,"Burning forests, flooding homes, and raging famine. The impending doom of climate change is scarcely a revelatory fact. The world — at least most of it — has come to the consensus that we are living on borrowed time, and that we ought to do something about it. Since fossil fuels are one of the greatest contributors to climate change, alternatives such as electricity are in high demand. The use of electric vehicles has been endorsed by celebrities, subsidized by governments, and made the subject of research and teaching by our very own institution — and that support is well-earned. With increased demand for electric vehicles and the batteries used to power them, the World Bank has estimated that production of battery metals will increase by up to sixfold by 2050. What many people might not know is that two thirds of the world’s cobalt — the key metal used to make these batteries — comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Located at the heart of Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo is the continent’s second largest country. Congo is rich in natural resources: From the rubber that powered the bicycle industry and later the automobile revolution, to the uranium used for nuclear bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and now the cobalt used in electric car batteries, Congo has often been the center of attention for outsiders looking to manufacture on a large scale. And yet, Congo’s wealth in natural resources has not translated to wealth for its citizens. With nearly 62 percent of its population living on less than $2.15 per day in 2022, Congo is one of the five poorest countries in the world. If anything, Congo’s wealth in minerals has been the architect of much of its misfortune. Political instability, deadly conflicts that have claimed lives of more than five million individuals, and human rights abuses — all of which can be traced back to Congo’s wealth. This has been the curse of the Congo, and it dates back almost a century and a half, decades before Congo became a sovereign nation. The geographical area that is now the Democratic Republic of Congo was once the Congo Free State, the personal fiefdom of Belgium’s King Leopold II. Under the guise of protecting its people against the slave trade, King Leopold claimed Congo in 1885 as his own personal property. With a huge market for ivory in Europe, King Leopold saw an opportunity to make a fortune from Congo — even if it occasionally required extorting the locals to do his bidding. Around the same time, in Edinburgh, Scotland, John Boyd Dunlop’s invention of the pneumatic wheel revolutionized motor transport in Europe — and changed the fate of the Congolese for the worse. Congo was rich in rubber, and the subsequent boom in the demand for the material came as great news for King Leopold’s finances. With an army, the Force Publique, at his disposal, he could extract and profit from the rubber as much as he liked. The locals, of course, bore the brunt of this venture. Given the labor-intensive nature of extracting rubber, it became increasingly difficult for the Force Publique to supervise labor directly. Accordingly, officials resorted to quotas to make sure production would still meet global demand. To enforce the quotas, the soldiers would kidnap the wives and kids of the local men and hold them hostage until the quotas were met. Failure to meet the quotas meant that their families would be left to starve — often to death — or have their hands chopped off. The Force Publique would raid villages, capturing produce and livestock, and until a village chief made coordinated efforts to produce a certain amount of rubber, the villagers would be left to starve to death. Children were not spared. Often used as porters for European explorers, they were forced to carry heavy loads on their backs through treacherous paths, where several of them would die from exhaustion and starvation. Children would be subjected to brutal punishment for as little as laughing in the presence of a white man. Many of them were kidnapped, or had their parents killed, and taken to missionaries in child colonies where they were trained to become soldiers for the Force Publique. Eventually, as African American missionaries were sent to Congo to scout for possible relocation for freed enslaved individuals, the horrors that had been neatly tucked in Congo were exposed to the rest of the world, and international pressure forced King Leopold II to hand over the colony to the Belgian government. By this time, 8 to 10 million individuals had died in Congo — a number that, despite its shocking magnitude, is conspicuously left out in the traditional Eurocentric litany of the 20th century’s horrors. King Leopold wiped out close to half the population of Congo in less than three decades.King Leopold’s ghost still haunts Congo. Cobalt mining in Congo today is characterized by elements eerily similar to how rubber was extracted in the past — exploitation, destitution and death. While most of Congo’s cobalt is extracted from large mines owned by foreign conglomerates, an estimated 20 percent is hand-mined by artisanal miners. Working without any protective gear, artisanal miners dig deep underground tunnels to access the mineral ore and extract it by hand using basic tools. In the process, they are exposed to dust containing cobalt, which puts them at high risk for lung disease. Because the hand-dug tunnels are unsupported, many of them collapse, often claiming the lives of the miners. For artisanal miners, safety is a luxury preserved for those who have means. Close to 40,000 children, some of them as young as six years old, work at these artisanal mines. With unpromising prospects for their education, many of these children are forced to work in the mines to support themselves or their families. And their work isn’t light: From carrying heavy bags on their backs to digging out ores by hand, the children of the mines perform tasks almost indistinguishable from the ones carried out by their adult counterparts. While artisanal mines account for most of the dangerous forms of extraction, the multinational conglomerates operating the mines can hardly absolve themselves of wrongdoing. In mining regions, the chain of events after mineral deposits are discovered is almost formulaic. Vast tracts of tree-covered land are cleared, toxic effluents start contaminating the water, the air becomes dense with dust from extraction, and soon enough, a manager from the mine announces that the venture has to relocate — leaving the local miners and polluted ecosystem behind. Given all the destruction that cobalt mining causes, should we give up on electric vehicles? Certainly not. The point of my article is not to decry the idea of electric vehicles as the sole and root cause of Congo’s misfortunes. My point is that as agitators for clean energy alternatives, we are not doing enough. At both the institutional and student level, Harvard is at the forefront of climate change action. From institutes that conduct solution-oriented research to activism by students that pushes for accountability and action, there is no scarcity of campus discourse on combating the climate crisis. As we continue to innovate toward and advocate for clean energy alternatives, we must find solutions that go beyond just “cleaner” alternatives. We must find solutions that do not create other problems. This does not mean we should wash our hands of Congo. Blanket assertions of corruption as being responsible for the situation in Congo deeply misconstrue the crux of the issue — Congo’s problems are also the world s problems. The need for car tires, nuclear ammunition, cell phones and electric vehicles, and the willingness to have them at whatever costs, have driven Congo further and further into her current predicament. As such, we have a responsibility to Congo to do better. I wish that our rush to stop the ticking time bomb that is climate change was not so inextricably linked to Congo — but that would be nothing more than a comforting lie. Cobalt mining in Congo reminds us that creating a sustainable future does not end with divesting from fossil fuels, or even ceasing their use. The conversation must go on, to ensure that our alternatives do not leave us in the same situation we are in with fossil fuels. Ultimately, we must ask ourselves: Does saving the future of the planet have to mean Congo dies today?

rice_thresher_2023_6,"ByImogen BrownandGeorgia Jensen11/28/23 10:39pm Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. When “Pro-Life After Roe” was published in the Thresher, we were in the midst of finalizing a semester-long report on the state of reproductive rights in Texas. We had spent the day compiling firsthand accounts of the panic, pain and trauma produced by abortion bans. It felt necessary to address the guest opinion and confront the harms of abortion restrictions. We first want to establish that the debate over when “life” begins acts as a detached, moralistic distraction from the real consequences of abortion restrictions. How to weigh the “life” of a fetus against that of the pregnant person and what makes “life” worth protecting are long-disputed philosophical questions. We should be discussing therealitiesof abortion bans and the harm inflicted on communities when healthcare is policed and politicized. We believe that the inflammatory rhetoric of the “life” debate inhibits open conversation around abortion. When one side denounces the other as supporting murder, it becomes impossible to engage in constructive dialogue. At its core, abortion is about autonomy. Since theDobbsdecision,over a dozen stateshave implemented near-total abortion bans. In Texas,abortion provision is a felonypunishable by up to 99 years in prison. Themajority of Americansand themajority of Texanssupport abortion rights, yet their intimate reproductive decisions are constrained and scrutinized by an anti-abortion minority. “Pro-Life After Roe” claims to champion “the forgotten in society,” but people of color, low-income individuals, immigrants, minors and other marginalized populationsface disproportionate health and financial consequenceswhen abortion is limited. Onestudyfound that over 72% of people who were denied abortions ended up living in poverty. In Texas, Black women sufferthe highest riskfor poor birth outcomes. Texas law includesvague exceptions for “life-saving” abortionsthat thrust physicians into murky legal territory and threaten pregnant people’s lives. The opinion sidesteps the issue of medically necessary abortions by claiming that certain life-saving procedures are not abortions because they do not intend to terminate the fetus. This ignores myriad circumstances in which intentional abortion procedures are absolutely medically necessary.Over 20 accountsfrom the ongoingZurawski v. the State of Texascase attest to the horrors of denying necessary abortion care. Many of the plaintiffs sought abortions because their fetuses displayed fatal abnormalities likeanencephalythat would — and often did — endanger the plaintiffs’ lives if carried to term. Why should someone be brought to the brink of death before being allowed a medically necessary procedure? Abortion restrictions exacerbate the extraordinary dangers of being pregnant in Texas. Texas already has thehighest maternal mortality ratein the nation.Over 46% of Texas countiesare designated “maternity care deserts,” with some residents traveling up to 70 miles to reach the nearest birthing hospital. The criminalization of abortion providers has further resulted in anoutflux of medical professionalswho provide essential pregnancy and gynecological care. Texas laws both demand that people carry their pregnancies to termandmake it remarkably unsafe to do so. “Pro-Life After Roe” argues that religious organizations supplement prenatal support, but the link provided by the author directs readers to a chain ofself-admittedcrisis pregnancy centers. Often faith-based, CPCs are anti-abortion organizations that masquerade as licensed healthcare facilities. They target uninsured, low-income populations by offering free ultrasounds, then do everything in their power to deter people from seeking abortions. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, at least71% of CPCsspread damaging misinformation, including claims that abortion carries cancer and infertility risks, and lie to people about how far along they are in their pregnancies. Worst of all, they are oftenstate-funded. Crisis pregnancy centersintentionally deceivepeople in order to propagate religious, anti-abortion agendas. Where is the “truth, mercy and love” in that? TheRice bubbledoes not protect us from the fallout of abortion restrictions.One in four womenwill have an abortion in their lifetime, the majority of whom are young adults. These areour peers, friends and loved ones, and we must center their realities. On both sides of the abortion debate, circular theorizing about “life” has produced an ideological stalemate. But we can no longer afford to ignore the real harms of abortion restrictions by discussing this issue in a moralistic vacuum. We owe each other honest, pragmatic conversations that challenge preconceived notions, misinformation and stigma. As “Pro-Life After Roe” stated, every person has immutable dignity. Under any circumstance, forcing a person to remain pregnant plainly violates that dignity. We are responsible for shifting the language on our campus — for recognizing abortion, not as a philosophical question but as an essential right. Abortion is a personal decision. Abortion is healthcare. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.

crimson_2023_89,"When I was fourteen years old, I found an older cousin’s iPod nano stashed away in an old basement room: a baby blue, perfectly-square brick of an MP3 player. Pushing the small, circular knob on its bottom to the right, I watched as a black Apple logo lit up on its screen. Utilizing the click wheel, I happened upon a song, curated by a name unfamiliar to me at the time: Lecrae. “Now all I see is money, cars, jewels, stars / Womanizers, tough guys, guns, knives, and scars / Drug pushers, thugs, strippers, fast girls, fast life / Everything I wanted and everything I could ask life” Click. This was my first introduction to Christian hip-hop. Having just committed afresh to Christianity and looking for ways to express my humanity and honor God, I was all caught up in religion. Hearing all that language about sin? No way. I turned it off. In time, I would return. There was something about the music’s content, its realness, that attracted me — and it would come to spare me my sanity as I grappled between my Blackness and my seemingly counterfeit faith. It is this tension between sacred and secular, between spirituality and culture, that made Christian hip-hop an incisive tool in retaining both my personhood and the purity of my faith. *** Innovative enslavement disguises as fresh freedom. As early as sixth grade, I felt the profound emptiness of living according to my own desires, so I chose to give up my life for Jesus. I felt I was spiritually transcending — at the cost of assimilation to white evangelical culture. Growing up in Colorado Springs, Colo., also known as “a mecca for evangelical Christians,” my newfound Christianity absorbed surrounding evangelicalism. Instead of sermons centering the mistreatment of the oppressed, our politics centered issues of sanctity: opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. The issues I heard about on the news at home misaligned with everyone’s concerns at church. When I was left on the margins, an alien floating between non-believers and church folk, Christian hip-hop spoke to me: “I really can’t tell if I’m overdressed or I’m underdressed / If I’m underpaid or just overstressed / If I’m cynical or just over this / Cause I’m tired of tryna get over there, man it’s over there / Party’s over” *** I’ve been caught up in Christianized double-consciousness. I’ve lived almost my entire life under the white normative gaze. I’ve had my share of weird experiences — hair petting, scary-calling, athlete-comparing — but tying them to racism? That seemed extreme. During the summer of 2020’s racial awakening and the Covid-19 scare, I decided to work as a Christian camp counselor in Colorado’s beautiful mountains. I was one of two Black counselors. As we trained, I realized I felt estranged. No internet service. What was going on with the Black Lives Matter protests downtown, around the United States? Hardly anyone that I was around was talking about race. While the others used their free time to have Bible study, play volleyball, or hang out, I went to the WiFi-equipped common area and looked up news articles and videos. I tried to read up on what was going on in the country. But it was never enough. This camp, centered around helping children find purpose, find life, find God, seemed to take little concern for the summer’s racial awakening. Even in training, before the children arrived, our Christian practice was centered around character building. When the news came that the kids would not come because of Covid-19 restrictions, so camp would be canceled, a part of me actually uttered a sigh of relief. Once again an alien floating between non-believers and church folk, Lecrae’s music spoke to me: “Aw man, now they actin’ like I’m suddenly political / Told me shut my mouth and get my checks from Evangelicals / Boy my momma raised me on Angela and Eldrigde / Chuck Berry made it, but the credit went to Elvis” *** I am hesitant to categorize this music that resonates with me. It’s not a genre. Mainstream radio doesn’t play it, and neither does the church on Sunday morning. Christian hip-hop is more than just music; it is a movement. Much like the protests of two summers ago, which parts of the media tried to co-opt for their own political agendas, Christian hip-hop (a name often ascribed to the music, rather than professed by its curators refuses to be named. I believe the complexity of Christian hip-hop is a lot like mine at Harvard: learning to love myself, for myself, just as I am. Attempting to glorify the God who calls me son, all without giving up my personality, my unique identity, my cultural background. Christian hip-hop is a golden needle in a haystack, a jewel in a barren field, a forsaken treasure. It is a testament to the potential for a flourishing Black and Christian cultural identity. When my Christianity — constantly threatened by cultural assimilation and the transgression of someone else’s social norms — is nearly lost, Christian hip-hop acts as a surgical knife, dividing between the beautiful and the ugly, putting me and my faith back together again.

crimson_2023_66,"This op-ed is part of a special opinion package, “Antisemitism at Harvard, According to Seven Jewish Affiliates.”View the full package here. “An antisemite is someone who hated me before I was born,” Elie Wiesel, survivor of Auschwitz, said. Antisemitism is a denial of humanity of the Jew. The reactions that occurred at Harvard in the wake of Oct. 7 considered Jews oppressors and, in some way, unworthy of human consideration. In the calculus of an antisemite, Jews are both subhuman and superhuman – vermin who control the world. Common antisemitic rhetoric places Jews at the center of conspiracies, secretly controlling anything and everything: America, the banks, the Middle East, a vast colonialist enterprise, immigration, the Federal Reserve, NATO, and even Taylor Swift’s concert tour schedule. People hate Jews because they are communists, capitalists, foreigners, residents, immigrants, elitists, have strange ways, are unassimilated, too assimilated, bankroll the left (like George Soros or bankroll the right (like Sheldon Adelson . People hate Jews because they are weak and stateless, or because they are Zionists and defend Israel. This hate is justified in a number of ways, and it is never just because someone is Jewish. One ideology common at Harvard is the colonialist settler ideology. Colonialists are people who come from one place, take a land, and now have two. But, Jews are far from being colonialists. Jews come from Israel. In this ideology, the colonialists are almost always white, but the Jews in Israel are quite diverse. Colonialists do not share the land, but Israel gave the Sinai Peninsula back to Egypt and has made many separate offers to share their land with Palestinians — which the Palestinians rejected. Further, Jews were kicked out of Israel by one colonial power — Rome — and returned by overthrowing the rule of another — Britain. Much of Harvard is captured by an ideology that centers oppression, but dividing all of the world into oppressor and oppressed is dangerous. Once you divide humanity by race or creed or nation into two camps — the good and the evil — you have adopted the mentality of the despot. This is bad for society, as well as for Jews. Although many do so in ignorance, when people chant “from the river to the sea” the most natural interpretation of their calls is advocacy for territory without Israel, without Jews. Israel is the only country in the world that is routinely and widely targeted for eradication. So is anti-Zionism synonymous with antisemitism? There are exceptions, but the overlap is striking. I have never heard of activists who are angry with China targeting Chinese restaurants in Paris, but when Hamas terrorists were recently arrested in Europe with plans to blow up Jewish institutions, they were not targeting Israel, but Jews. If someone is angry at Israel, they target Jewish synagogues, businesses, and restaurants — anything associated with Jews, anywhere in the world — no matter their relationship to Israel. This enmity has deep roots. I have a position at the Harvard Divinity School, and I often wonder whether we teach students that both the New Testament, and to a lesser extent the Koran, contain messages hostile to Jews. Do the students learn that Martin Luther said Jews “are a serpent’s brood” and their synagogues should be burned, or how during periods like the Almohad persecution, Jews could accept Islam, flee, or die? How Christians persecuted and periodically murdered Jews for some 1,500 years? Jews experienced more acceptance in Muslim lands, yet still were labeled impure, subjugated, and were often persecuted. Many of my congregants in Los Angeles were forced to flee Iran when the Shah fell in 1979 — their property confiscated, the leader of the community executed, and the Khomeini regime making clear they were unwelcome in the new Islamic republic. Having lost everything and escaping with their lives, years later, they still have nightmares. Why all this hatred against one small people? We remained different, distinct. We would not become Christian or Muslim. We were outsiders, others, champions of diversity. Moreover, Jewish culture — portable, book-focused, and one that venerates scholarship and learning — primes us for economies where information and mental agility lead to success. When you don’t like someone, seeing them succeed magnifies the antipathy. Finally, Jews introduced the idea of ethical monotheism — the moral demands that one God makes on human beings — to the western tradition. As Jewish essayist Maurice Samuel said, “no one likes an alarm clock”; Jews represent conscience and conscience is a disruptive and painful partner in our lives. The energy and outrage Jews generate — making up 0.2 percent of the world population — is oddly disproportionate. Antisemitism is a wild, irrational eruption. Harvard has along and ignoble historyof antisemitism, as Harvard President Claudine Gay said in her remarks to Harvard Hillel in October. It is time to admit it, confront it and overcome it. One can criticize policies without calling for the end to the only homeland Jews have ever known. One can demand a Palestinian state without globalizing the intifada — the term for a protest that previously resulted in over 110 suicide bombings that targeted buses, cafes, and malls. If we cannot learn to argue civilly at Harvard, how can we have hope for the civility of other places in the world? Jews gave the world a precious gift: the idea that each human being is an image of God. I pray that we all remember and honor that gift. Rabbi David J. Wolpe is a visiting scholar at the Harvard Divinity School. He served on Harvard’s antisemitism advisory group before stepping down in early December."

Its contents are current to October 19. As members of the UBC academic community and educators committed to principles of social justice and equality, we are troubled by the statement that UBC Interim President Deborah Buszard issued on October 11 titled “Supporting the UBC Community.” The statement explicitly refers to “the atrocities from the terrorist attacks on Israel” but remains silent regarding the ongoing state terror committed by Israel against Palestinians. At the time of this writing, and as reported by UN bodies, human rights organizations and news agencies, Israel has: These actions are a clear violation of international humanitarian law and amount to crimes against humanity. They are taking place while Israeli officials continuously dehumanize Palestinians. Israel’s defence minister called Palestinians “human animals.” Members of Israel’s House of Representatives, the Knesset, and apologists abroad openly advocate for slaughter, ethnic cleansing and collective punishment, amounting to anotherNakba, or catastrophe, when over 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes in 1948. President Buszard’s statement also makes no reference to Palestine or Palestinians, choosing to refer instead to “Israel, Gaza and elsewhere. The erasure of Palestine as a geography, Palestinians as a people, and their plight as a nation dehumanizes Palestinians and denies them the fundamental right to safety, security, freedom and liberation. It runs contrary to the claim that UBC is committed to “providing a safe, inclusive environment, with a shared value of peaceful relations.” UBC’s declared support for decolonization and practices of equity, diversity and inclusion ring hollow in light of this partisan approach. Such dehumanization comes in the wake of similarly lopsided statements by UBC’s Faculty Association and other university administrations across Canada, the US, and the UK. Statements that erase or dehumanize Palestinians may have a dire impact in Palestine and in the diaspora, as made evident by the hate-driven murder of Wadea Al Fayoume, a six-year-old Palestinian-American child in Chicago. In light of all of the above, We send a message of support to all Palestinian colleagues and academic communities across North America and Europe that are facing a hostile climate of intimidation from their governments, media, and university administrations. We affirm the right of the Palestinian people to freedom and sovereignty from Israeli occupation, settler colonialism, and apartheid. We renew our commitment to the safety and well-being of UBC’s Palestinian students, faculty, staff and their allied colleagues.

crimson_2023_134,"“Hi! We’re fundraising for the crisis in Sudan right now —” “Sorry, I’m not interested.” The past week of my life has been defined by the repetition of this interaction, accompanied by glances of pity and discomfort as I haul around posters and flyers advertising the fundraiser for medical relief for the crisis in Sudan. My peers avoid eye contact, cross the street, or rush to classes, dodging another plea for money for another seemingly backwards nation in crisis. And it’s not to say that such a reaction is entirely unwarranted. In a world where we, as struggling college students, are inundated by a slew of worthy causes, it is hard — and frankly, emotionally taxing — to pick and choose which ones to amplify and donate to. But what my peers do not realize is that to me, this is everything. The home and livelihood of my family, the streets I spent my childhood wandering — bombed and burned before my eyes. On April 15, a war broke out in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, between the national army and a powerful paramilitary group. In the two weeks since, hundreds of civilians have been killed and thousands more wounded. More than half of Khartoum’s 59 hospitals have been shut down by the crisis, leaving very few open facilities to service its population of 6.3 million. Water and electricity have been cut off across much of the city, and the United Nations has termed the situation a humanitarian catastrophe. Yet, many international relief organizations have stopped operations in Sudan. Powerful nations, including the United States, have pulled out their diplomatic personnel through emergency military evacuations in the span of barely over a week. If you’ve been on Instagram or watched the news in the past few weeks, you may have caught glimpses of the crisis: Pictures of the capital burning, videos of soldiers firing into homes, and loaded tanks parading through the ash-covered streets. Alternatively, you may have heard about the crisis from the several people and organizations supporting the fundraiser at Harvard. But these short interactions can only help so much, because the media continues to focus primarily on death and destruction rather than the conflict’s humanitarian toll, framing my people as complicit in a war we have no stake in. A war which cannot be won. Corpses now litter the streets I walked just a few months ago, in a city where it is now a privilege to escape from and become a refugee. Yet it seems that the plight of Sudan falls upon deaf ears, our suffering almost an expectation of the international community. There is a perception that this is, and has always been, our normal. I cannot help but compare our situation today to the beginning of the war in Ukraine a little over a year ago. Harvard flew Ukrainian flags in solidarity with American ones, held vigils and fundraisers, and hosted political discussions that were not suggestions but the expectation. I wonder why, when the current humanitarian toll is comparable, that the same courtesy and care is not afforded to us as well. The answer, quite simply, is that where I see the beautiful, endless, glittering Nile, the towering pyramids, the rich and fertile soils that have raised generations of my family, and the fierce warriors of my proud Nubian bloodline, the world sees violence, death, and destruction. How can the world possibly see humanity now when our African bodies were written off as disposable centuries ago? How can it understand that we have one of the richest traditions of successful democratic civil uprisings in the world? How can it see that when the coup came, when our democratic dreams of 2019 were dashed by the Sudanese military in 2021, we continued to fight? That it was the international community that legitimized the rule of power-hungry men in their own self-interest? That we were silenced, our dreams for democracy used to strangle our very being? How can it begin to imagine our resistance, our livelihoods, our smiles, our power, our kindness? The answer is that on the international stage, Sudan does not matter. We are not just disposable — we are a nuisance. It feels like our diverse and beautiful population of 46 million people is written off as inconvenient, standing between the Western world and untapped natural resources. It feels as though the success of the international community can be equated with our extinction. Our inescapable reality was a controlled detonation waiting to go off to the nations of the West, a pressure cooker where the lives of the 16,000 American citizens who remain in Sudan are not deemed a priority, it seems, because of the otherness — the Blackness — of the Sudanese people. And so, I question how it is possible that I entered college four years ago having been a part of the successful Sudanese democratic revolution, proud to inject my nation in the academic and political discussions here — yet I leave with a nation in tatters, and depart from a university that could not have done less to help. Yet I will continue to fight and advocate and fundraise for Sudan. The international community may have written us off, but I guarantee you we will fight for survival with our very last breath. Sudan is deserving of freedom. Of peace. Of justice. Of life. Reem K. Ali ’23 is a Government concentrator in Leverett House."

Here’s what to expect at the March 15 Senate meeting. In an effort to move toward the use of open educational resources (OERs , Senate will be voting on changes to fee-based digital learning tools used for assessment. These include a cost cap of 12 per cent of the domestic course cost (which is equivalent to around $70 for a 3 credit arts course , a cap of 20 per cent of the final course grade which can be attributed to assessments using fee-based digital learning tools and that all fees must be outlined on the course syllabus. There are exceptions to these rules. This historic vote will bring UBC Vancouver’s policy closer to UBC Okanagan s digital learning tool ban. The UBC Vancouver Senate expects these fees to be gone by the 2028/2029 academic year. In February, the Curriculum Committee brought forward the approval of the new MBA Climate Track which included BAEN 580A: Indigenous Relations & Climate Economy as an elective for the program. Student senators, led by Faculty of Education Student Senator Holly Patraschuk and Graduate Student Senator Jorden Hendry, were vocal about their opposition to this course being an elective and voted to send this back to the committee for further consideration, calling on UBC to honor its commitment to our Indigenous Strategic Plan. This was successful and resulted in this program track to be sent back to the Curriculum committee. The new program proposal requires BAEN 580A, replacing BAEN 549: Sustainability & Innovation.

wildcat_arizona_2023_12,"“Ron DeSantis” byGage Skidmoreis licensed underCC BY-SA 2.0 The backwards state of Florida dug itself deeper into the ground last month with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ decision to ban Advanced Placement African American Studies from high schools across the state. This news comes after DeSantis signed into order theStop W.O.K.E. Actof 2022, in which“W.O.K.E”is an acronym for the “Wrongs to our Kids and Employees.” Such wrongs, in the eyes of Florida’s legislation, include the intricacies ofcritical race theoryfrom which employees and students are protected under the Stop W.O.K.E. Act. Critical race theoryhas been circling public debate across the country. The concept has unfortunately become a politically polarizing fight like almost everything in the United States. It really should be accepted as a fact, though, because, day after day, more instances of the instilled prejudice in American social systems are unveiled. The AP African American Studies course is set to debut across 60 high schools in the United States withCollege Boardin charge of its implementation. Florida’s education department disrupted the course from being launched on Jan. 12, when theysent a letterto College Board complaining about the validity of the course curriculum and linking their argument to their ignorance of critical race theory. What is perhaps even more troubling than this DeSantis-led complaint is College Board’s compliance. On Feb. 1, the organization announced the significantwatering downthey have done to the AP course set to pilot through 2024.The New York Timeshas identified some of the revisions done to the course as cutting a number of Black figures associated with critical race theory, Black-queer history and feminism. DeSantis, who has madecountless homophobic claims and effortsin his time as governor,defended his argument: “Queer theory. Now, who would say that an important part of Black history is queer theory? That is somebody pushing an agenda on our kids.” Not only is he denying thelinks between queer history and Black history, but he is recycling this repeated argument against the queer community as an excuse to completely ban African American Studies. A study done in 2019 byPulse Opinion Research for U.S. Term Limitsconcluded that there was a 64% approval rate statewide for DeSantis around the time of his election. Not all Floridians, of course, are cheering for DeSantis like he’s their god however. Fedrick Ingram is a native Floridian and the president of the Florida Education Association andhe saidDeSantis “believes he was elected to be a king, not the governor.” Ingram said African American studies should be valued in the same manner that Japanese history or music theory are, and “politicizing African American history is shameful of the governor.” It turns out that some of those who are protesting DeSantis’ decision are backing their argument with a case close to home. In 2010, Arizona officials banned a Mexican American studies program from making it into Tucson schools until 2017 when ajudge ruled it unconstitutionaland racist. Despite this feat, “it took seven years of litigation to have that founded,” Nolan Cabrera said.Cabrerais an associate professor in the Center for the Study of Higher Education at the UA and we agreed that the same unconstitutionality and racism applies to the situation rooted in Florida. On our own campus, there have been multiple instances of racial hostility targeted at Black students within the last year. Last September, Black studentKai Leigh Harriottbecame one such victim when UA official Maribel Alvarez filed a report with the University of Arizona Police Department against her following a series of troubling events. Harriott defended herself with her own report against Alvarez, but university officials failed to support her. In fact, Harriott said UA Dean of Students Kendal Washington White incited much of the unjustified retaliation against her. She did receive backing from students however, most notably in the form of anOctober protestled by the Coalition of Black Students and Allies. I asked Cabrera what he thought students could do to protect themselves and their peers from blatant racism at school. He responded by saying, “I think that’s actually the problem. That, you know, racism is so widespread that it’s almost impossible to isolate yourself from it.” He did, however, stress the importance of advocating for those causes that we believe in. It’s inspiring to see that the student body did exactly that when they showedsupport for Kai Leigh Harriottin October despite the campus administrators who let her and many of the Black student body down. People like Ron DeSantis sadly don’t come few and far in between. He is just one elected official representing the majority of a whole state and who knows how many more keeping racism in this country alive. When we see racism occur far away from us, such as in Florida, we must recognize that it can be just as dangerous as nearby. For that reason — and many more — it needs to be called out until it is dispelled from our systems and no longer institutionalized.

Harvard took part in shaping this revolutionary fervor. General George Washington even quartered his troops in the historic Massachusetts and Hollis Halls. Today, Harvard University has been so corrupted by its apparent desperation to appease the far-left that its moral compass has been long forgotten. It is profoundly disappointing to see Harvard University, a prestigious institution which we care so deeply about, devolve from fostering an age of American independence into an institution that enables abhorrent antisemitism. On Oct. 7,Iranian-backed Hamas terroristsinvaded Israel and brutally murdered more than 1,000 people, leading to thedeadliest dayfor the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas terroristsmassacred concertgoers,raped women, barbaricallyburned people alive,beheaded babies, andkidnapped more than 200innocent men, women, and children, many of whom arestill being held captiveby Hamas in Gaza. As the free world watched in horror at the grotesque Hamas attack, evil antisemitism erupted on America’s college campuses. Following the attack, more than 30 Harvard student organizations co-signed apublic statementin response to Hamas’ attack claiming that Israel was “entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” These Harvard student groups effectively blamed Israel for the unimaginable atrocities that Hamas inflicted on Israeli civilians. While this statement is sickening and multiple groups have sinceretracted their signatures, what is worse is the failure of Harvard’s leadership to immediately condemn the statement. Harvard’s silence created a vacuum in which heinous antisemitism echoes loudly. To fill this void, I led my fellow Harvard alumni on Capitol Hill in a letter condemning the statement and demanding that University President Claudine Gay denounce antisemitism. Yet throughout President Claudine Gay’snumerous statementsat this point, she has never condemned the Harvard student organizations; instead, she has declared that Harvard is committed to creating an environment that fosters free speech and open dialogue. Harvard alumni and students are well aware that the University stifles free speech; recently, Harvard rankeddead lastin the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression’s college free speech rankings. Strikingly, in multiple of President Claudine Gay’s remarks responding to the Israel-Hamas war, she has stressed Harvard’s commitment to freedom of speech,even saying, “It’s in the exercise of our freedom to speak that we reveal our characters. And we reveal the character of our institution.” President Claudine Gay has certainly revealed the lack of character of Harvard as an institution — coupled with Harvard’s abysmal record of protecting free speech, the willingness of Harvard University to now vehemently defend free speech whenthat speechcalls forthe death of Jews and the eradication of Israel is absolutely revelatory in Harvard’s unacceptable lack of moral clarity. This rot of antisemitism is not only plaguing Harvard University but is proliferating on campuses all over the country. While these universities desperately attempt to appease the far-left through hiring an army of diversity, equity, and inclusion officers, a professor at Cornell University claimed that Hamas’ murdering and hostage taking on Oct. 7made him feel exhilarated. A group of students atGeorge Washington Universityprojected “Free Palestine from the river to the sea,” a phrase calling for the eradication of the state of Israel and the genocide of the Jewish people. The plague of antisemitism on our college campuses is rotting out these institutions, and it must be stopped. Universities across America receive billions of taxpayer dollars through federal grants, contracts, and tax incentives. It is unacceptable, and frankly un-American, that taxpayer dollars are supportingHarvard professors— evendepartment chairs— and students who are defending the phrase, “from the river to the sea,” which implies genocidal elimination of the Jewish state. This is why I am working to ban federal funds from any university that enables antisemitism to proliferate on their campus. House Republicans willinvestigate how universitieslike Harvard have devolved from helping lead our nation in the fight for independence to promulgating terrorist apologists. To ensure Jewish students are able to attend school in a safe environment, I will work in Congress to demand that America’s colleges and universities implement institutional changes to rid antisemitism from their campuses. As a senior member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, the highest-ranking Republican woman in the United States Congress, and a Harvard alumna, I will hold President Claudine Gay accountable when she is under oath today for her responsibility in allowing antisemitism to proliferate on Harvard’s campus and continue to call for her resignation. As a Harvard alumna, I believe we must demand that the most well-recognized and preeminent higher education institution in the world rediscover its moral clarity and eliminate antisemitism from its campus.

stanforddaily_2023_50,"Since the Honor Code took effect in1921, Stanford has expected students to report one another’s alleged cheating during exams, thus keeping instructors (i.e. professors and TAs from proctoring exams. This century-long policy changed last May following the work of theCommittee of 12(C12 , which resulted inupdated Honor Code languagethat made academic integrity “a community undertaking that requires students and instructors to work together to ensure conditions that support academic integrity.” In addition to the updated Honor Code language, the C12 approved the commission of a multi-year study to assess the merits of exam proctoring and examine broader academic integrity concerns (e.g., mental health on campus, pressures to succeed . The aim of this study is to serve as the basis for future University academic integrity policies. The committee tasked to lead this study — namely, the Academic Integrity Working Group (AIWG — is being selected as we speak. It will be composed of four students, four faculty, one administrator from the Office of Community Standards and another from the Office of the General Counsel. Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU leaders have been tasked to nominate the student members of the AIWG, with the Vice Provost of Student Affairs (VPSA nominating its administrators and the Faculty Senate doing the same for its faculty. But unlike the ASSU, the Faculty Senate and the VPSA have approached this nomination process with zero transparency. Across all of its meetings this quarter, the Faculty Senate devoted no public discussion to its AIWG nominees. The VPSA has also failed to publicly discuss the AIWG’s administrative nominees. Nothing excuses the Faculty Senate and VPSA from openly addressing this matter. I expect better from the Faculty Senate, which has the University president, provost and the deans of its seven schools sit in on its meetings. I expect better from VPSA, which reports directly to the provost. Due to the significance of AIWG’s work — particularly its implications on academic integrity, mental health and OAE accommodations — the lack of transparency concerning the nomination of its faculty and administrator members breeds mistrust among students. Secrecy causes students to speculate, despite having little basis, about the intentions of faculty and administrators. A potential us-versus-them mentality and the negative perceptions surrounding the process could easily be avoided if the Faculty Senate and VPSA were more open with students about how it chooses its nominees. Stanford students already maintain a level of mistrust towards the faculty and administration. The Faculty Senate previouslythreatenedto unilaterally impose proctoring in a full circumvention of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate’s (UGS oppositionto proctoring. Senators Gurmenjit Bahia ’24 and Kyle Becerra ’24describedthis as “a disregard for undergraduate student voices” and “the democratic process.” Senator Amira Dehmani ’24 described the relationship of trust between them and faculty as “completely broken.” Students’ lack of trust in the University has been a long-standing issue. The lack of transparency at this stage therefore only serves to exacerbate these sentiments. I believe that the Faculty Senate and VPSA should look to the ASSU on how to transparently conduct the AIWG nomination process. The ASSU hasevaluatedits AIWG nominees in detail, discussing their qualifications and experiences in public meetings. The UGS and Graduate Student Council (GSC introduced the nominees in one meeting andvotedto confirm them at their next meeting. The Faculty Senate and VPSA could follow the ASSU’s lead in adopting this approach, and this effort would certainly go a long way to rebuild trust between students and faculty and administration. In order for students to trust the University again, I believe that students deserve more transparency. The ongoing presidentialsearchprocess should take that seriously. The University addressing athleticaccommodationsas it moves to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC should take that seriously. Graduate students, in theirfightfor a more affordable Stanford, deserve to know about the decisions being made in their name. The AIWG nomination process is no exception to this. The glaring lack of transparency over this only serves to erode students’ faith in the University. The burden to remedy this, I believe, rests entirely in the hands of the Faculty Senate and VPSA.

crimson_2023_163,"Just months ago, I felt the breeze of the motherland hold me so tightly I could almost sense my Kurdish ancestors offering me protection, healing, and joy. I felt Kurdistan — a place I believe to be a land of freedom despite the geopolitical forces that have shackled it across four states. I stood in my mother’s city, Slemani, feeling more connected to her than ever, absorbing the memories of her childhood in the land that created her, uplifted her, and held her. In moments like these, my identity was not a sharp split, but an eternal bond to those who came before me. Though my joy back in the homeland made every border on this Earth feel meaningless, internally I still experienced their lasting effects. I felt as though my linguistic disconnect from Kurdish identity affirmed the borders that have perpetuated harm against my people. As a Kurdish and Syrian-Arab woman, my ties to language have always been complex. My English is better than both of my ancestral languages, and I feel a constant imbalance between Kurdish and Arabic. At Harvard, I was able to immediately enroll in an elementary Arabic class; however, it took almost a year of requesting language instruction to hear Sorani Kurdish in a Harvard classroom for the first time this month. While I feel empowered by the opportunity to learn the Kurdish language at Harvard, I am infuriated that others do not get the same chance. In different parts of Kurdistan, the act of preserving our indigenous language is often treated as criminal. That is why it’s more important than ever to teach and learn the language across the diaspora. On September 16, 2022 — around one year ago —Jina Amini, a Kurdish woman from Rojhelati (Eastern Kurdistan died, reportedly after being beaten by the Iranian morality police. Her Kurdish name, the one her family used, was not the same one she used for official documents because of state discrimination. Today, the people of Kurdistan continue to repeat “jin, jiyan, azadi,” meaning “women, life, freedom,” as history repeats itself with the silencing of Kurdish heritage, language, and history. Across Kurdistan, the Kurdish language has been a target of erasure because it is perceived as a threat to the regimes that try to diminish our culture, history, and freedom movements. Pressure on the usage and teaching of the Kurdish language persists in regions like Bakur (occupied Northern Kurdistan , where the streets of Amed and Mêrdîn continue to flourish with vibrant markets and songs of resistance. Occupying governments continue to inflict violent pressure on cities in Rojhelat like Sine, where the mountains stand taller and stronger than the bullets that pierce Kurdish bodies. As I begin to learn Kurdish at Harvard, I think of women like Zara Mohammadi, a teacher from Sine, who was sentenced to five years in prison because she taught Kurdish in her class. I think of the people who are subjected to violence for preserving the culture I am just beginning to understand. I think of the people who are incarcerated for teaching, writing, and speaking the words I have just begun to learn. Sometimes, the Kurdish language feels foreign to me, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I am deeply connected to these lands. I, like other Kurds across the diaspora, long for a world of freedom, of azadi. I want not only to learn the language, but to preserve it. I want todance the halparkeas I understand every word that rings along to thesounds of the saz. But most importantly, I want to honor the work of people like Mohammadi, who embody resistance. This process of learning the language that has survived generations in my family, generations in Kurdistan, is one that both resurfaces and introduces many emotions. I feel rage at the continued attack on Kurdish identity and language. I feel a sense of healing, as I recognize the words that filled my family’s household. Most importantly, I feel a sense of urgency, a desire to protect and share all aspects of my ethnicity. To continue reviving what doesn’t appear on a map. We Kurds will continue to yell “jin, jiyan, azadi.” From Amed to Halabja, from Mahabad to Efrîn, we will uplift the narratives of those who fought to keep our struggle alive. We will remain unapologetically Kurdish, anywhere and everywhere, because people like Jina Amini were never able to. Because people like Zara Mohammadi are put behind bars for doing so. Because our rivers flow across borders as one and our mountains greet one another from miles away, embracing one another in a shared pain yet a shared sovereignty. As I connect each letter in the Kurdish alphabet in a Harvard classroom, my pen gliding across the sheet in an effort to connect what was once fragmented, I think of a free Kurdistan in which our chants of “jin, jiyan, azadi” evoke our rich history, not our drawn-out suffering. I think of a free Kurdistan in which our language, history, and culture are no longer considered crimes in their being, but testaments to our ancestral lands. Dalal M.

crimson_2023_27,"After Hamas’ atrocious terror attack on Israeli civilians earlier this month, some decided that supporting Hamas amounts to being “on the right side of history.” Likewise, some Harvard students and recent graduates seem to believe that being on “the side of justice” requires supporting Hamas by framing its horrific actions as a legitimate decolonization attempt. While the justification of an attack on civilians is extremely worrying, it reflects a deeper problem on campus: utter ignorance about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict itself. This ignorance has led to statements that are, at best, misinformed and, at worst, deeply dangerous. For that, I can only advise my fellow classmates that, if they want to be on the right side of history, they should know history — specifically the history of Jewish people in Israel — first. As an Israeli who has spent her life learning about the conflict and living its ramifications, I am mortified by the historical inaccuracies spreading around campus used to justify violence and the eradication of the state of Israel. The heart of many of the criticisms I’ve seen recently rely on the idea that Zionism or Israel is inherently colonial. But that view is completely ahistorical. The Jewish people inhabited the land of Israel between1,200 B.C.E.and136 C.E.In this land, we developed a language, a culture, and a governing body. There, we became a unified people. After living under the foreign occupation of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and the Roman Empire, in their several attempts to regain sovereignty, we were exiled time and time again, though a minority Jewish presence remained in the land continuously. When Jews were deported from the land, many were sold into slavery, and others were dispersed across the region and outside of its boundaries. Nevertheless, Jewish culture did not die out. Over the approximately 1,800 years of exile, we longed to return to our homeland, retained our culture and tradition, and never lost our identity or assimilated into other nations. During the 19th and 20th centuries, we escaped the countries we lived in as we were slaughtered in masses and finally returned to our homeland, which since our departure, had been under the control of various empires but never had its own independent regime. Zionism is the ideology — borne from that centuries-long desire to return home — supporting Jewish self-determination in the only Jewish homeland that has ever existed. The modern State of Israel is the manifestation of this political movement. After diving into the history, it becomes clear that framing Israel as an inherently colonial state completely ignores Jewish history and denies the Jewish people’s connection to the land where that history took place. It ignores archeology, genetic studies, and historical records like Josephus’s “Antiquities of the Jews,” all of which unambiguously establish the history of the Jewish people in the land of Israel. The most obvious manifestation of this distorted historical understanding arises in chants like “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” — a call for Palestinian self-determination in the entirety of the land that currently encompasses both Israel and Palestine. This rallying call presents Palestinians as the sole people indigenous to the land between the river and the sea, while denying the indigeneity of the Jewish people and, therefore, denying the right of Jewish people to also exist as a free entity in this land. It claims that any Jewish state on any part of the Jewish homeland is illegitimate. I believe in the right of the Jewish people to self-determination precisely because I believe in the right of Palestinians to self-determination. One right to self-determination does not exist without the other, because they both stem from the same principle: the belief that peoples have the right to live freely in their indigenous land. Unevenly endorsing the right to self-determination is either a logical absurdity or a deliberate attempt to deny the Jewish people this basic right. Of course, the Israeli government has its failings. It should be criticized for its faults, a cause I have taken up my entire life, in protest after protest. Nonetheless, criticism against the government should not — by any means — lead to questioning the right of that country to exist. Israel’s right to exist cannot be undermined by its government’s faulty actions, just as the Palestinian right to self-determination must not be undermined by the Palestine Liberation Organization’s or Hamas’ actions. If I can still stand for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination even after Hamas brutally massacredmore than 1,400 of my own peoplethis month, pro-Palestinian activists should stand up for the Jewish right to self-determination, in spite of Israel’s many flaws. So next time when a classmate calls to free Palestine “from the river to the sea,” know that they are calling to once again exile one of this land’s indigenous peoples. For these people — the Jewish people — rights and safety have been repeatedly elusive throughout history. Being on the right side of history is fighting for the right of both people to exist and enjoy sovereignty in their native land, not just one.

Send topics you d like covered toyeah I know, the rent situation is shit . I knew immediately that I wanted to write something on it. Here we are. To learn more, I spoke to Zoe Nicoladis, a fifth-year economics and psychology student, who’s part ofUBC Bona Fide, the club hosting UBC Bachelorettes. “The idea came from a lot of conversations with people about how online dating is so frustrating,” said Nicoladis. “The origin was really frustration with that whole atmosphere, but especially after COVID, it feels like that’s the only way to meet people.” Nicoladis also cited her evolutionary psychology class with Dr. Azim Shariff as a creative influence on the inspiration for this project. We shared a laugh when I told her I’dinterviewed himfor aLove Nestarticle about fuckboy culture. “In my class, we talked about how the brain is really wired for in-person connections. Especially after COVID, we should be meeting in-person, that’s what humans are supposed to do,” she shared. “We started a club called UBC Bona Fide to create ways in which people can meet in-person. UBC Bachelorettes is one of those initiatives. Dating reality TV shows are so addicting because it’s so cool to see people fall in love, and we just wanted to bring that to UBC.” When I asked Nicoladis more about how her team plans to interpretThe Bachelorette’s format, she said the team has been reviewing applications and will be picking five students to be UBC’s bachelorettes. The bachelorettes will then have five roses to give to UBC students who attend the match-making event — and you’re invited. “Anyone can come in and go in the room and have five minutes to chat with whoever. Each bachelorette will have five roses, and they can pick five people they’d like to see again,” she said. “They’ll have to go on dates with the five people, and we’ll slowly get more narrowed down until they each find the one, hopefully.” Nicoladis said this is the first time anything like this is happening at UBC and that the Bona Fide team hopes to host the event every term to give students more in-person opportunities to find love. “This is a trial run, so we have low expectations,” said Nicoladis. “Hopefully it could be a long-term thing.” Love NestisThe Ubyssey s dating column — both satire and serious.

crimson_2023_118,"It was around this time last year that I had gotten back all of my college acceptances, and began to come to terms with the reality of leaving behind my friends and family in northern California to attend Harvard. For months I had claimed that moving far from home didn’t scare me, but once the decision was made, the first instances of doubt quickly crept in. Long, expensive travel days to and from Visitas opened my eyes to the fact that if I moved across the country, my family and friends would not often be able to visit me. The reprieve of a weekend trip home would be wholly impractical. And as the summer before my first year progressed, more reasons for doubt crept in: Moving my belongings across the country became a logistical nightmare, and the reality of not personally knowing anyone else attending Harvard set in. What had I gotten myself into? This uncertainty left me seeking reassurance, but in the wake of the excitement and enthusiasm surrounding my acceptance, I was scared to voice these doubts. To high school seniors wondering whether moving far away for school is a good idea, I’m here to offer you that reassurance I once sought. It’s been about eight months since I moved, and while I miss my favorite coffee shop and getting to pet my dog, there have been a number of unexpected joys from moving thousands of miles away from home. At Harvard, for the first time in many years, I had the chance to make an entirely new set of friends. There was no petty drama of “cutting people off” or “dropping” familiar faces — I was in a new place, surrounded by entirely new people. Losing the built-in companionship of family forced me to totally reorient my everyday interactions and surround myself with friends that supported me the same way. If you’re scared to leave people behind, a daily walk across campus becomes an opportunity for hometown gossip, and with nobody local around to overhear, you can fearlessly drop first and last names. In other words: I’ve gotten good at talking on the phone. The distance will reveal who from home you can live without, and who you can’t. Then, when term breaks come around, you can make time for the people who really matter. Without the bristling caused by everyday interactions, conflict dwindles and reunions tend to be sweet and nostalgic. The time difference from Massachusetts to California means that I can wake up late and go to bed late, and my family will idyllically trail three hours behind me. I often find myself on the phone with them after I’ve stayed up finishing an assignment; it’s midnight here, but it’s only 9 p.m. back home, and not even my 12-year-old brother has been sent to bed. Also, nobody here has to know what activities I did in high school, so there’s no social pressure keeping me from making changes and trying new things. I’ve made big changes — like some friends I’ve made here, Ino longer run competitivelyas I did in high school — but making little changes can be refreshing too. I could have picked a brand new favorite color upon arriving at Harvard, and instead of my childhood best friend questioning when I swayed from blue to green, everyone here would have just smiled and said okay to this revolutionary new answer. As the incoming class of 2027 continues to scour informational pages, make pro-con lists, and travel for admitted students days like Visitas in the lead up to acceptance deadlines, I want to offer assurance that distance from home is a factor worth embracing, not cowering away from. As you prepare to move away, you’ll shove your belongings into oversized Ikea zipper bags, ship dorm supplies you ordered online to your brand-new mailing address, and relish the opportunity to reinvent your life: yourself, your friends, your daily routine. A fresh start, newfound independence, and a potential reputation rebrand all feel like cliché reasons to move away, but don’t dismiss them: Let yourself explore and rediscover. The opportunity to move away is a privilege, and if you do have that choice, I urge you to consider taking it. Move across the country, move across the world, and I have a feeling you’ll find your own reasons to be grateful you did. McKenna E.

stanforddaily_2023_93,"Persis Drelljust announcedshe will be stepping down as provost after six years. If you’re anything like some of the people I talked to, your reaction was ‘what the heck is a provost?’ The provost is the chief academic and budget officer. For our University community, academics is obviously hugely important as one of the major ties that bind us together. But thebudget for themulti-billion dollar enterprise that is Stanford University isfiercely complicated, too, making the yearly responsibility required to keep the University running something of a Herculean task. The impact the provost has on everyone in the University is exemplified by theveritable army of high level administratorswho report directly to the Office of the Provost. A central tenet of democracy, to which our University leadership has astated commitment, is that people impacted by a decision must have a say in that decision. Given the impact the provost has on everyone in the University community, it is imperative that the faculty-led search committee have voices and representation from across the University. Specifically, there should be representation from the undergraduate, graduate student and postdoctoral scholar populations at a minimum. Those committee members should have voting seats as required for true representation. Stanford has a stated commitment to shared governance. Recent actions havecalled that commitment into questionfor some members of our community. Proactively including student and postdoc representation in the important task of choosing a new provost for our University is a step that could help begin to repair the broken trust. It would also align with aspecific recommendationfrom the recentLong Range Planning Reportproduced by the Stanford University Postdoctoral Association (SURPAS .

rice_thresher_2023_53,"ByGrace Eichenour3/7/23 10:03pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Over the past year, Rice has piloted a partnership with Generation Conscious, offering zero-waste and toxic-free, refillable laundry detergent sheets to students during apilot programat Hanszen College. The program consists of a central dispenser, in which students can refill a reusable container with 10 individual sheets at a time. These sheets are packaging free and plastic-free, and require 97% less water and 95% less carbon to produce and distribute than the average leading detergent. The pilot program ran for the duration of the Spring 2022 semester, RESP/RISE programs in the summer and the start of the Fall 2022 semester. However, it came to a screeching halt when the inventory was exhausted. While the refill station saw large utilization numbers – with over 15,000 laundry detergent sheets dispensed over this six month time-frame – and the exit survey of the pilot program revealed overwhelmingly positive reviews, administration at Rice have been hesitant to commit to the program at all residential colleges, and as a result the status of accessible and sustainable laundry at Rice has entered an increasingly vulnerable state. If we want sustainable laundry to be the reality for Rice students for years to come, we must continue to be vocal and encourage Rice to follow through on its commitments to climate justice. As someone who is actively engaged with the program in my roles as a zero waste intern at the Administrative Center for Sustainability and Energy Management and an environmental justice coordinator at Generation Conscious, I have had the pleasure of witnessing the positive impact this program has made at Rice, beyond giving students access to free laundry detergent. Generation Conscious has been able to engender change within the Rice community due to its undeniable compatibility with Rice’s commitments to reach carbon neutrality and promoting cultural inclusivity, including but not limited to, eliminating hygiene insecurity, reducing plastic and water waste, and replacing pollutive infrastructure with sustainable, accessible and equitable substitutes. The detergent refill station reaches carbon parity to the traditional pod and liquid detergents after merely 750 sheets are used, and every additional sheet after that saves 0.14kg of carbon dioxide. Applying this to the Rice population yields that if two out of three students swap their current detergent for the sheets, Rice can halve the climate impact of laundry by 2030. As the expansion of the program continues to be postponed by the administration, Taylor Gilliam, another environmental justice coordinator at Generation Conscious, and I, in collaboration with ACSEM, have consistently fought and advocated for the continuation of the partnership. In a recent survey that we conducted, 96% of participants elected that they would like the expansion to occur, and some indicated they would be willing to increase their tuition by up to $15 to fund the program. Most recently, we drafted a resolution in conjunction with the Environmental Committee of the Student Association. The goal of the legislation was to emphasize that the undergraduate student body unanimously supports the expansion of the program and to call on the Rice administration to ‘Be Bold’ and fund a full expansion of the environmental justice laundry detergent programs to all residential colleges. The legislation was unanimously ratified on Feb. 20, demanding the administration fund the yearly inventory to supply each member of the undergraduate student body with 5 refills of 10 detergent sheets. The highlights of the resolution, which can be found in the SA’s documentation, that garnered excitement among student leaders were FGLI employment opportunities, reducing Rice’s net climate impact through emissions reduction and student fellowship opportunities. As the SA is empowered by the opinions of the student body, the unanimous support for this new legislation emphasizes the overwhelming support the program has gained throughout its pilot. The SA uses its power and legislation to then inform the Rice administration of general attitudes on campus, and this legislation is no exception to that rule. While the resolution unanimously passing in SA is a huge win in our fight to secure Generation Conscious’ spot on campus, there is still work to do. A written agreement to make the program a permanent aspect of life here at Rice is still yet to come, and the support of the student body is the most powerful tool in our efforts to achieve this goal. Whether you have used the program before or you are just now learning that it exists, it is imperative that we all speak up and get involved in making Rice a more sustainable and equitable place. Administrative inaction has only made the student body more eager for this program, and if we want to uphold the sacred relationship between students and our leaders that Rice so desperately wants to foster, the causes and programs students fight for must be acknowledged and implemented. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

That is exactly what ASU did on Feb. 16! Bravo! I felt so welcomed and included when, as a multiethnicstudent, I received an email calling me Black. Thanks, ASU, for acknowledging my identity in such a respectful and tone-aware manner! Now thankfully, in my case, even though I am multiethnic, I do identify – racially speaking – as Black. So something like this doesn t really bother me. However, I can t be sure that this is the case for allmultiethnic students on campus who received this email as well. When I put down my demographic information in my ASU application, I marked both white and Black, and it s likely what other multiethnic students did too. But I m not just being called Black, I m being called a Black Sun Devil. Thanks, ASU, for making it clear that for some reason if you re Black you re somehow different from other non-Black Sun Devils. Again, very inclusive and oh-so-tone-aware! All I can say is, I sure hope when pride month comes around, I get an email calling me an LGBTQ+ Sun Devil. Keep that same energy! In all seriousness, seriously? Did no one read this email to themselves or someone else before hitting send? And I m not the only one who was rubbed the wrong way by this. Many of my fellow Black Sun Devils were posting about this on the ASU Snapchat story, calling it out as weird and borderline racist – rightfully so. They could ve worded that better, said Penda Sisay, a freshman studying civic and economic thought and leadership. Most definitely wasn t expecting it, which is why everyone reacted the way they did. Regardless, as the email continues, it links toa website for Black History Month events. Aside from maybe just coming off as repetitive to students who may have been aware of these events already, such as me, this isn t terrible… That is until you realize that this website was only provided via email to 1,345 first-year Black Sun Devils, according to an ASU spokesperson. If a website lists events labeled as welcoming to all students, wouldn t the logic be to send this email to all students? Shouldn t Black History Month be a month for all people to come together to celebrate Black excellence? What a very inclusive choice to instead share this website only with Black Sun Devils. The email also included links to some tutoring resources for us to reach out to if we were having some trouble academically. While many mass emails to students from the University include these resources, it was out of place given the context and the purpose of the message. Now, I think the question here is obvious: why would you link to tutoring resourcesin an email that’s about celebrating Black History Month that was sent exclusivelyto your Black students? This is weird and even slightly racist if you do just the smallest bit of reading between the lines. And again, it s not just me getting weirded out. If you re trying to speak about Black History Month and how you re excited that, as a Black student, I am staying in your community, why are you adding a link to tutoring services under it? Sisay said. That just looks very wrong. The email ended with links to the 24/7Open Call Open Chatservice through ASU Counseling and theDean of Students Office. I emailed the University outlining my concerns, asked why it was only sent to Black students, and why the University chose to include tutoring services. In response, an ASU spokesperson said the email was part of the University sLIFT Initiativeand guided by the ASUBSSI(Black Student Success Initiative Community of Practice established at ASU in 2020 as part of theUIA(University Innovation Alliance BSSI to develop and launch a personalized and comprehensive plan to positively transform the experience of Black students. Perhaps in the future, you should have someone outside of these organizations read your emails before sending them. I don t understand how this slipped through without someone flagging it for a rewrite. At the end of the day, I m sure the University didn t intend to come off this way in their email. I m sure that they genuinely did want to try to be kind and welcoming to their Black students. But when I, and others, read this email, those welcoming feelings of inclusivity clearly did not translate.

stanforddaily_2023_85,"It’s been an exciting year in the Faculty Senate. A brief overview for those who have missed the most recent kerfuffle: Professor Jakovljevic and Professor Lipsick, who sits on the Faculty Senate Steering Committee, brought forward amotionrequesting that Rebekah Mercer and Rupert Murdoch be terminated from all association with Stanford. Ms. Mercer and Mr. Murdoch are on theBoard of Overseersat the Hoover Institution. President Marc Tessier-Lavigne responded with someprepared remarks, which included the claim that if the Faculty Senate voted in favor of this motion, it “would be setting itself up as a thought police.” Nonsense. I think I’d probably vote against the motion. Ms. Mercer’s and Mr. Murdoch’s indirect support and amplification of prejudice, anti-semitism and white nationalism are immoral and distasteful. I don’t like their association with Stanford. But at the same time, Ms. Mercer haspublicly statedthat she doesn’t personally believe in such hateful rubbish. While I think most of President Tessier-Lavigne’s prepared remarks are mistaken (more on that in a bit , he makes one point I do agree with: it is important that different groups within the University have a freedom of association. The Hoover Institution has decided that the benefits of association with Ms. Mercer and Mr. Murdoch outweigh the drawbacks, and I want to respect that decision. But while I’m inclined to agree with President Tessier-Lavigne that we should not terminate association with Ms. Mercer or Mr. Murdoch, his prepared remarks are misguided, inaccurate and illogical. His defense of the Hoover Institution’s judgment is couched in wild claims of the collapse of the University and jingoistic dog whistles: “thought police,” “orthodoxy” and “autonomy.” By falling back on such emotional absolutes, the statement misses the real challenges and the difficult questions we must face. My deference to the Hoover Institution’s judgment on Ms. Mercer and Mr. Murdoch is conditional, as everyone’s should be. Stanford’s principles of academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas are not absolute. We do consider certain ideas or behavior so unacceptable that we disassociate from them:we removed David Starr Jordan’s name from campus spaces, in part due to his promotion of eugenics, and I hope we would not have accepted post-conviction donations from Jeffrey Epstein, asMIT did then said it was a mistake to do so. Furthermore, in an academic setting, not all ideas are created equal. As scholars, our primary responsibility is to decide which ideas are good and worth consideration, and which are not. As thePolitical Science department’s webpage on Academic Freedomarticulates well, “Of course, scholars have constitutional rights to express outlandish views as private citizens or in public discourse. They do not have the same protections if they propagate such views in their position as scholars… Although the First Amendment would prohibit government sanctioning an editorialist for theNew York Timesif he were inclined to write that the astrological signs of world leaders explain the incidence of inter-state wars , no political science department could survive if it were unable to deny tenure to a young scholar similarly convinced.” There is a line; there are people Stanford will not associate with. Jordan and Epstein are clearly on one side, whileGeorge Sorosand theKoch brothers(despite all of the controversies around them are clearly on the other. The Faculty Senate has actively debated particularly challenging cases that are close to the line,such as the tobacco industry. Such debates are critical, for us to actively explore, define and defend our values and principles when they are in tension. Perhaps Ms. Mercer and Mr. Murdoch are close to the line. Perhaps they are far. Having a named position of authority, rather than only funding research, might move where the line is. We won’t know unless we debate the matter and consider the facts. We all want what is best for Stanford. While I currently don’t support Professor Lipsick and Professor Jakovljevic’s motion, I wholly support their raising it for debate. I respect that their moral compasses tell them that the negative association of Ms. Mercer and Mr. Murdoch with Stanford so greatly outweighs any benefit. I respect that they have the moral integrity to argue so. I want to hear their arguments and consider them. As a reply, I would hope to hear a defense of the Hoover’s Institution’s decision on the merits of the case. But by instead responding with a hyperbolic set of predictions on the downfall of Stanford, President Tessier-Lavigne’s statement does exactly what it says we shouldn’t do: it argues we cannot even ask the question. Philip Levis serves on the Faculty Senate and is a Professor in the Departments of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.

state_press_2023_7,"The NHL may have gone back on its pride tape ban but the fact it happened shouldn t be forgotten. The NHLreversedits backward decision to ban pregame Pride gear this week after an Arizona Coyotes player,Travis Dermott, defied the authoritative ban. His courageous stance for inclusivity should be celebrated. Over the summer, the NHL banned pregame Pride jerseys and tape after several players refused to wear the gear last season. By doing so, the NHL backtracked on years of extending a hand to LGBTQ+ fans. Season after season, players and teams wore sweaters decked out with flashy rainbow colors and Pride Tape to spice up otherwise dull equipment and to show LGBTQ+ fans that they were welcome to the sport. Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid and Boston Bruins captain Brad Marchand immediately decried the ban. But it took an unknown second-line defenseman to end the NHL s ruling and support the LGBTQ+ community. Dermott has advocated for LGBTQ+ rights throughout his NHL career and was raised to stand up to mistreatment. Dermott wrapped Pride Tape on the top of his stick before theCoyotes gameagainst the Anaheim Ducks in Tempe. Like my parents said growing up, How awesome would it be to be the guy people look up to? That s what really hit home when I was a kid, especially from my mom, Dermott toldPHNX Sports. You want to grow up and be that guy. While the league changed its decision, the fact that the NHL instated the Pride Tape ban initially upset some ASU LGBTQ+ club leaders. Sophie Warnock is an activist and the president of Confetti, an LGBTQ+ student organization on the Downtown Phoenix campus. Warnock thought the NHL was forcing people to hide their identities with the ban and praised Dermott for taking a stand. It just goes to show how strong it is and how much it s been developed, Warnock said. It just goes to show that even if you take away flags or other stuff like that, you re not going to take down the LGBTQ community. It s going to be there no matter what you do. Brenna Garcia, facilitator of advocacy for the ASU Rainbow Coalition, was also proud of Dermott for violating the ban. Garcia said professional leagues must use their platform to create welcoming environments so players don’t have to protest in the first place. The NHL should prioritize making their operations more diverse and welcoming because there clearly are queer and trans athletes seeking community and representation, Garcia said. Being able to have things like pride tape and jerseys are the bare minimum. The NHL s decision is a step in the right direction for a sport infamous for its toxic culture. In past years, leagues have permitted atoxic bro culturewhere players only talk about sports, women or music. Hockey s glaring culture issue creates an atmosphere where anyone who isn t seen as normal is excluded, making potential fans scared even to attend games. I d also feel unsafe because if I can t even sport my pride flag, how am I supposed to feel safe in a community? Warnock said. Like I could be attacked, and they wouldn t care because I can t even show a pride flag. As a lifelong fan, it saddens me that people don t feel safe watching hockey. This sport has brought me cherished memories of attending St. Louis Blues games with my dad, where we sing Gloria and count goals with the famoustowel man.I ve been on top of the world when my team won the Stanley Cup and devastated when my childhood hero was traded. I ve also seen hockey build community off the ice and bridge gaps between people who would ve never met. I ve seen diehard fans embrace strangers, packed subway cars celebrate exciting wins, and even bitter rivals share a laugh. No one should feel excluded from a sport that can create so much joy. That s why we need to thank Dermott for standing up for his beliefs and proving that hockey can change for the better to include new demographics of fans. Hockey should be for everyone, not a select few. Edited by Mia Osmonbekov, Walker Smith and Caera Learmonth. Reach the reporter atjcbarron@asu.eduand follow@jackcbarronon X.

crimson_2023_159,"Does your dorm room feel like Dante’s seventh circle of hell? Do you now personally identify with that scene where Frosty the Snowman becomes a sentient sweat puddle? Are you looking more and more like a microwaved popsicle? If so, congratulations on completing your first week at Harvard University! While some students may complain of trivial inconveniences such as “sweltering dorms” and “emergency heat advisories,” I’m writing to assure you that this weather is perfectly normal and completely temporary, so don’t fret about that lack of air conditioning! Now you might be thinking, “But, Mireya, my room feels hotter than Hugh Jackman in the Sahara. Is this not a safety issue?!?!” Yes, yes it is! But as the saying goes, “if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.” At least,that’s what HUDS workers were forced to dowhen temperatures in the Mather House servery became so intense that administrators had to close the dining hall in order to protect workers from the suffocating heat. But worry not! As the Dean of Students Office reminds us, Harvard has many air conditioned spaces to offer students a blissful reprieve from Cambridge’s oppressive heat, such as our gyms, our libraries, and the Smith Campus Center. So if you find yourself struggling to sleep in your 90-degree dorm-oven, just grab your pillow and head on down to Lamont! In my time at Harvard, students have slept everywhere from dining halls to labs to libraries simply to escape their sweltering rooms. Trust me, you’ll have company. Now if you’re worried about having to sleep in a library every night, rest assured that these warm days are numbered. The hottest temperatures in Cambridge last from mid-June to mid-September, and luckily for us, no one lives on Harvard’s campus in the summer. Well, except for summer school students. And student researchers. And maybe some athletes. And theater people. And graduate students. And PBHA students. And high-schoolers. And also some international students. But they’re probably fine, I imagine. Still, for those of you who’d rather not move into your lab to avoid waking up in a pool of your own sweat, I’ve compiled a list of tips and tricks for surviving Harvard’s sweltering dorms. Enjoy. 1 Drink lots and lots of water. This will make you need to pee, giving you frequent, wonderful excuses to book it to the nearest public restroom — which, unlike your dorm, is probably air conditioned. 2 Hang out in air-conditioned spaces. If you’re unsure of which spaces have air conditioning, use this simple trick. Do Harvard administrators work there? If so, it’s probably air conditioned. 3 Get many, many fans. Make them follow you on Twitter. Mobilize them with charismatic tweets. Convince them to write and perform a groundbreaking, 20-hour rock-opera about the importance of central air conditioning units. Trick Harvard’s administration into attending by telling them it’s a Kroks concert. They will be so moved that they’ll have no choice but to immediately install portable AC. 4 Wear fewer clothes. This will help you discover your rockin’ bod and boost your self-esteem. This newfound confidence will put a swagger in your step that’ll make you feel infinitely cooler! 5 Close your blinds during the day. This will prevent any outsiders from looking into your room and seeing the portable air conditioner that you secretly installed to prevent yourself from turning into a student-shaped puddle. 6 Reach out to other students. Especially ones living in DeWolfe or the Inn. These dorms are some of the few that have working air conditioners. Befriend these lucky students. Seduce them. Do whatever it takes to drink in some of that sweet, sweet AC. 7 Take cold showers. The freezing cold water will provide a shock to your system, causing you to momentarily forget your hot and sticky reality. You will soon begin to crave this feeling and seek it out in other places. You will become interested in sky-diving. Bungee jumping. Cliff diving. You will become so good that you are offered an unpaid, full-time internship performing dangerous and life-threatening stunts with Cirque du Soleil. You can then leave Harvard and take the offer immediately, for Cirque du Soleil has air conditioning. So, yeah, I hope that advice was helpful. In all seriousness, though, it’s high time that Harvard upped its AC game. Climate change is here to stay, and expecting students and House staff to live and work in sweltering conditions without proper cooling systems becomes more unethical every year.

rice_thresher_2023_45,"ByThresher Editorial Board4/11/23 11:59pm The first annual Moody X-Fest isin the books, and by most standards it should be considered a success. But if this is to be an annual event — and we hope that it will be — a few adjustments need to be made. First, the name ‘X-Fest’ has got to go. It’s bad. But more importantly, students should be meaningfully involved in the planning process to ensure that future festivals continue to attract student engagement. To our knowledge, the only solicitation of broad student feedback in planning this year’s Moody Fest was a ranked-choice survey open to students, although it certainly wasn’t advertised as such. With potential artists including Bad Bunny, Robert Earl Keen and Paul Wall, it feels safe to say that none of the names on that survey were plausible Moody Fest headliners. No offense to the (roughly four Grouplove die-hard fans on campus, but we’re pretty sure that no one was that excited about them performing. Students went because it was a free concert, and a novel one at that. But if we continue to book B-tier bands, we’re worried students will quickly lose interest. To be clear, we are not calling for a student takeover. No one wants to turn the Moody Fest into a Beer Bike-esque event where a pair of sophomores are stressed beyond belief trying to plan the whole thing. But including a few students on the planning committee, or conducting multiple rounds of student focus groups, would go a long way toward making sure that the festival will be well received on campus. An event designed to attract Rice students should actually appeal to their interests. We’ve also heard rumblings that this “experience” might not be an annual concert, but rather an ever-changing product with different types of events hosted each year. We love that idea, but again, students need to be meaningfully included in the planning process. Because, and we mean this with all the love in the world, we’re pretty sure that a group of middle-aged adults aren’t super in-touch with what types of “experiences” college students will enjoy. Our humble suggestion? A campus-wide game of laser tag — or anything the students actually enjoy.

state_press_2023_31,"When someone’s housing is determined by their income and is not treated as a public good, the result is the establishment of massive luxury developments while the University neglects its housing and affordable non-University options are not adequately provided. The $1.8 billion development,South Pier at Tempe Town Lake, that could be on the ballot in May is a perfect example of how the commodification of housing has a tremendous impact on student life. The development is styled as a world class waterfront experience. ASU students and Tempe workers should oppose this development and help make housing a public good for all. The development advertises fine dining, an observation wheel, a luxury hotel, a business hotel, residences, shopping (with the world’s best luxury brands , entertainment andmore. The overlying theme is clear: luxury. READ MORE:Controversial Tempe Town Lake housing development lands on spring ballot One might think that when the city of Tempe first heard the details of the proposed development, its leaders would have taken a moment to think about its student population and Arizona swell-knownhousing crisis. Unfortunately, they did not, and the development is in the process of potentially being put on the ballot through an appeal process including the city of Tempe andCentral Arizonans for a Sustainable Economy. It s not like students and workers have it easy with the housing situation in Tempe. I applied for housing back in October, I put my deposit down, I had everything ready to go… I flew to Arizona, I got here on the fifth of January, and they told me they couldn t accommodate me in the Tooker Dorms this semester, said Gabriela De Los Reyes, a freshman and international student at ASU studying materials science and engineering. I had to look through Facebook Marketplace to take someone s lease to be able to get a place as quickly as possible because all of the places that I was applying to were full or were out of my budget, De Los Reyes said. The average rent for an apartment in Tempe is $1,912, according to RentCafe. While this may be affordable for those in middle-to-upper income brackets, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology living wage calculator says that a living wage in Tempe for one adult with no children is $18.48. The Tempe minimum wage is $13.85. What we are really concerned about is the use of tax incentives and public resources to incentivize the development, said Brendan Walsh, the executive director ofWorker Power, a social welfare organization. They re (the city of Tempe making great pains to try to figure out how to help get a similar development agreement, this one in the case of the Coyotes entertainment district, onto the ballot by May, Walsh said. This referendum, not accepting the signatures and putting the item on the ballot, seems to me, as I said, to be cynical and hypocritical, in the extreme. It s unjust to students and workers in the area for the city to attempt to force the Tempe Town Lake development off the ballot. It was already bad that the city tried to make the development happen in the first place, but that they’re still trying to force it after strong opposition is a travesty. When someone s housing is determined by their income and is not treated as a public good, the result is the establishment of massive luxury developments while the University neglects its housing and affordable non-University options are not adequately provided. I don t agree that housing should be based on the profit motive. I feel like it s a human right, I feel like it should be accessible for everyone. I feel like people should stop seeing it as a means to create wealth and rather as a means to create benefits and value, De Los Reyes said. ASU students and workers in Tempe should strongly oppose the luxury development, whether it ends up on the ballot or not, and push for housing as a human right.

thetech_mit_2023_1,"MIT has certainly had a notable series of controversial events recently regarding free speech, fromthe rash cancellation of Professor Dorian Abbot’s EAPS lecture in 2021, tothe “problematic postering” incident earlier this year, to the set of provocative speakers invited this term bythe MIT Students for Open Inquiry group. Out of the first of these controversies emergedthe MIT Free Speech Alliance, which advocates for expanded free speech protections at MIT (and of which I am a proud member . Subsequently, MIT adopted theMIT Statement on Freedom of Expression and Academic Freedom, which is comparable to the famous Chicago Principles in formalizing freedom of speech and freedom of expression rights on campus. And while MIT is a private university and, hence, is not technically held to the same legal standard that public universities are held to in regard to First Amendment protections, I certainly hope that MIT’s free speech policies would be as expansive as those enshrined under the First Amendment. Recent events, particularly the disruptive protests held by the MIT Coalition Against Apartheid (CAA , have cast an even brighter light on MIT’s free speech policies, to a far greater extent than prior controversies did. Indeed, the two recent opinion pieces inThe Techlast month discussing these events both pointed to the importance of free speech on campus. As a starting point, it is worth notingthe value in not excluding “hate speech” from standard free speech protections. My first real exposure to this concept was in 17.035 (aka 21H.181 , where Harvey Silverglate was invited to speak to our class one day. Mr. Silverglate is one of the co-founders ofthe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression(FIRE , which is one of the leading advocacy groups for free speech protections on college campuses across the United States. During our conversation with him, one of my classmates raised a hypothetical: What about students who advocate in support of hate groups or terrorist organizations (say, a local chapter of the KKK or ISIS ? Mr. Silverglate answered that those students still nonetheless had the right to free speech on campus. This answer, of course, stunned me. “This is protected speech?? Is he crazy?!” I surely thought. However, after hearing Mr. Silverglate’s explanation for his stance, along with thinking more deeply on this issue myself, I came to realize that there may indeed be rational reasons for “hate speech” to be protected as free speech. Firstly, there is always the concern of speech regulations potentially devolving into a “slippery slope.” After all, “hate speech” is already a nebulous term, so it stands to reason that it could potentially be expanded and warped further and further over time, until it encompasses a broad swath of all kinds of speech. An obvious counter to this “slippery slope” argument is that it is merely a logical fallacy, and that the arguer should simply step off the “slippery slope.” In an ideal world, this could be the case; unfortunately, history suggests otherwise. In fact,these types of regulations tend to backfire,hurting the very people they ostensibly aim to protect. Secondly, due to the nebulous nature of “hate speech,” there is a strong potential for speech regulations to be enforced in a biased manner, in which a double standard applies depending on the content of the speech. To those who doubt this will occur, I would simply point tothe present situation, in which it seems to unfortunately be an all-too-common occurrence to see someone who previously was very much in favor of free speech restrictions when it came to certain speech content suddenly discover the importance of free speech protections when it comes to other speech content, or vice versa. Finally, there is the reason that Mr. Silverglate provided for his view in my 17.035 class: He would want to know who the KKK or ISIS supporter in the room is, if only to know not to turn his back to them. When we heard this, my classmates and I chuckled at how absurdly, yet obviously, true this was. Yes, it can be beyond painful to find out that members of your community hold hateful views; however, surely it is better, if only for your personal safety, to know *who* these people are, so that you can react accordingly. Of course, the above three points do not mean there is no cost whatsoever associated with allowing “hate speech.” I personally have experienced the costs of this myself, whether it was when a passing motorist in the Bay Area shouted at me and my other Asian-American friends to “go back to your country,” or when a deranged bus rider in DC lobbed disparaging remarks about my ethnicity at me. These incidents were certainly disgusting to experience, even if I believe they nonetheless involved protected speech. And obviously, these costs can increase further to the extent that such speech grows more severe, more pervasive, or more offensive. So intuitively, there must be some line at which these costs ultimately outweigh the benefits of permissive speech policies. The Supreme Court has established that harassment that “is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school” crosses a line beyond standard free speech protections. This standard makes sense, asit ensures speech is protected up until the point at which it begins to seriously interfere with the ability of our fellow classmates to enjoy the benefits of attending our great school. I have not been to campus recently, so I cannot personally attest to the current atmosphere here. However, to the extent that any students have been intimidated by rhetoric on campus to a sufficient degree such that, e.g., they are legitimately fearful to venture to classes, and this rhetoric has been “severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive,” then clearly this line would have been crossed. Such rhetoric also clearly would not necessarily need to be aimed directly at those individuals, as long as it satisfied that three-pronged test. To explicitly use one example brought up duringthe hearing held by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on recent events, calls for genocide presumably satisfy both the “severe” and “objectively offensive” prongs, simply by their very nature. So, to the extent these calls were also “pervasive” (e.g., being chanted in back-to-back protests, or being repeated in locations across campus , such that the affected students could not effectively avoid this speech while going about their lives, then this rhetoric would no longer be protected speech. Now, my understanding, based oncommunication from the MIT administration, is that the Committee on Discipline (“COD” is currently investigating individuals against whom complaints in this matter have been filed. Firstly, in light of recent events, it should be reiterated that the CODmustinvestigate these complaints. Any attempt by the administration to delay, disrupt, or otherwise interfere in proceedings would be not only deeply wrong-headed and immoral, but also insulting and injurious to all the members of our community who have filed complaints. Moreover, I strongly urge the COD to provide due process to all those it investigates and to ultimately pursue proper sanctions, up to and potentially including expulsion, against all those, and only those, who crossed this line from protected “hate speech” to unprotected “severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive” harassment aimed against other members of our community, or those who violated MIT’s content-neutral “time, place, and manner” policies (discussed further below . Finally, even to the extent that “hateful” speech or other extreme rhetoric is lawfully protected, and rightfully so, by no means does that imply such speech should be accepted as is. If anything, the opposite is true: this sick, vile sludge should frequently and consistently be called out for what it is. So, let me be clear here and unambiguously state that: Assaulting another human being on the basis of race, ethnicity, or religion is repugnant. Finding glee in the suffering of another human being is beyond perverse. Calling for genocide is utterly evil. No ifs, ands, or buts. For friend or foe, for a neighbor or a stranger, I will always stick to my convictions on this matter. Ultimately, refusing or ignoring to call out this speech will only lead to rampant de-humanization. And, absent a widespread collective understanding of our shared humanity, I fear that we will all spiral further and further down into an abyss of collective madness. On that note, I also want to say, to any member of our MIT community who may have felt isolated or attacked over the past few weeks simply for existing as a living, breathing human being, you are not alone: I will gladly stand alongside you in spirit, and I will always recognize the dignity inherent in you as a fellow human being. And I am certainly always willing and happy to lend an ear if you ever want to reach out. Now, with this discussion of “hate speech” in mind, are there any (other limitations to free speech rights at all, whether at MIT specifically or across the United States generally, that are reasonable to enforce? The answer is yes. For example, I generally have the freedom to rant about howthe SALT deductionis terrible. But if a municipality wants to prevent me from talking about this specifically on a megaphone at 2 AM in a residential area, that municipality has the right to restrict me so long as this is part ofa content-neutral, narrowly tailored noise ordinance. Similarly, public universities have the right to apply these “time, place, and manner” regulations as long as they are content-neutral and narrowly tailored, and they leave open alternative channels for the speaker(s , following the Supreme Court’s three-pronged test on this matter. Again, it should be noted that MIT is not a public university, and hence does not strictly need to align with this standard; fortunately, though, the “MIT Statement on Freedom of Expression and Academic Freedom” appears to align with current case precedent regarding the First Amendment, specifying that: “MIT does not protect direct threats, harassment, plagiarism, or other speech that falls outside the boundaries of the First Amendment. Moreover, the time, place, and manner of protected expression, including organized protests, may be restrained so as not to disrupt the essential activities of the Institute.” As an aside, it should be noted that merely stating an adherence to First Amendment principles does not necessarily mean, unfortunately, that these principles will always be followed. To the extent they still occur on campus, unconstitutionally broad restrictions on speech, such aswholesale bans on banners or flags, should continue to be called out and rejected as the illiberal policies they are. Now, in regards to “time, place, and manner” restrictions, I am aware of at least two clear instances where the CAA deliberately violated such policies. The first is the organized protest that occurred on November 2, in which members of the CAA disrupted the office of the MIT Center for International Studies (“CIS” . Ina letter, the CIS Director, Professor Evan Lieberman, noted that “many staff reported having felt alarmed, intimidated and even afraid,” and he followed further that “the protest involved methods that we consider to be unacceptable and a violation of MIT policy.” Policies against disruptive protests occurring in semi-private office space would surely satisfy the Supreme Court’s three-pronged test for “time, place, and manner” regulations. The second isthe organized protest that occurred on November 9 in Lobby 7. The CAA appears to have planned to holda protest from 8 AM to 8 PM in the Infinite. In a pre-emptive response, on November 8, the MIT administration circulatedpolicies outlining certain areas in which protests could be held, which notably excluded Lobby 7 and the Infinite. One CAA member claimed this came as a “complete surprise” and that it “was very obvious it was a means of trying to censor this and shut down this protest.” Undeterred, the CAA moved forward with its plans, first arriving in Lobby 7 at around 7:30 AM. Counter-protestors subsequently showed up, first arriving at around 9:00 AM, with the two sides then facing off for several hours. With tensions escalating, MIT staff evidently tried to have the protesters move to another location, to no avail. By noon, the MIT administration appears to have been concerned aboutescalating tensions leading to an outbreak of sustained violence, and, as a result,called on all individuals to leave Lobby 7 by 12:15 PM. According to the article, all counter-protestors subsequently left, but many protestors remained, with the CAA President reportedly saying that the protestors decided it was important to maintain a “strong and unified position.” Subsequently, additional, non-MIT-affiliated individuals joined this protest. The protest continued until 9 PM, before finally ending. So, was this protest protected speech, or did it violate MIT’s content-neutral “time, place, and manner” regulations and thereby cross the line into unprotected speech? To answer this question, I ignore the distinction of MIT being a private university and consider First Amendment precedent generally, thereby affording the CAA greater free speech protections than it otherwise might receive. Past precedent suggests that the initial guidelines circulated by the MIT administration the day prior to the protest didnotpass the Supreme Court’s three-pronged test on “time, place, and manner” regulations. In particular, these policies outlined a limited (albeit admittedly large in area set of outdoor spaces in which protests could occur, and further specified that “t hese spaces must be reserved in advance with reasonable notice.” Given that these policies were only circulated the day prior to the protest, it is not clear if they feasibly allowed for alternative venues for the protest to occur in. In addition, given the timing of the circulation of these policies, it is also unclear if this was entirely content-neutral, if they were sent out purely in response to the message that the CAA intended to convey at its protest. Finally, and most importantly, restrictions placed by universities that limit free expression to certain areas (i.e., “free speech zones” havehistorically been struck down as unconstitutional, with one court ruling holding that free speech must be permitted on “park areas, sidewalks, streets, or other similar common areas … irrespective of whether the University has so designated them or not.” This being said, what about content-neutral prohibitions only on protests specifically occurring in Lobby 7 or other interior areas, which I understand exist at MIT? Assuming these were publicized well before hand, would these prohibitions similarly fail this test? I would venture no. Namely, an argument could be made that a university has a vested interest in, e.g., ensuring that pedestrian traffic is not restricted by protests, and this reasoning could presumably allow for such a restriction to pass constitutional muster. Nonetheless, the policies circulated by the MIT administration on November 8, as stated, likely failed the Supreme Court’s three-pronged test on “time, place, and manner” regulations. The same, however, cannot be said for the subsequent request by the MIT administration that all individuals leave Lobby 7 by 12:15 PM. As a starting point, the threat of imminent violence has a strong tradition in jurisprudence for tempering freedom of speech; for example,Brandenburgfamously established the “imminent lawless action” standard. Given the events of the morning, it seems reasonable to think that sustained violence could have potentially broken out if both protestors and counter-protestors continued to face off into the afternoon. And universities arguably have not only the right, but also the obligation, to prevent violence and uphold general order on their campuses. Now, turning to the original three-pronged test, and considering the prongs in turn, firstly, this request was content-neutral, as it applied to both protestors and counter-protestors. Secondly, this request was narrowly tailored, as it applied solely to Lobby 7. Finally, the MIT administration allowed for the protest to occur in a different venue; in fact, MIT staff evidently attempted to help the protestors relocate, but the CAA unfortunately refused to take this offer. As such, it is clear that the MIT administration’s request that all protestors leave Lobby 7 on November 9, due to concerns over violence, would satisfy the Supreme Court’s three-pronged test for “time, place, and manner” regulations. Moreover, as far as I am aware, the CAA has neither apologized for these past violations nor promised to avoid future violations. In fact, at the November 12 protest, the CAA appears to have been unrepentant, with, as I understand it,one CAA speaker saying that: “We remain steadfast … we won’t back down … stood up to one of the most powerful institutes in the world and got them to back down … we are strong, united, and powerful … so we will let MIT know that we will keep fighting and we will keep pushing.” As such, there is no reason to believe that these two events will be isolated occurrences, absent either the CAA facing meaningful consequences for its actions or a significant shift occurring in the composition of its leadership, with the latter appearing unlikely barring the COD carrying out significant disciplinary action (i.e., expulsion . Now, how are the CAA’s repeated, deliberate violations of MIT’s content-neutral policies relevant for recognition by the Association of Student Activities (“ASA” ? Straightforwardly, in Article III, Section 1 ofthe ASA’s Bylaws, the responsibilities of recognized student groups are laid out, which include point #2: “Each activityshall complywith … MIT policies on student conduct” (emphasis added . Moreover, Sections 2 and 3 of Article II of the ASA’s Bylaws further specify that “a ny ASA recognized activity not meeting its responsibilities as set forth in this constitution and the policies of the ASA may be subject to derecognition.” This also intuitively makes sense: ASA-approved groups can use the MIT name and, in some instances, operate with funding from MIT, so that continued ASA-recognition implicitly means tacit approval from the MIT administration. Again, I understand that the COD is supposedly investigating individuals. However, I am not aware of the COD also investigating the CAA, or other student groups, as a whole. As such, the resulting course of action that the ASA Board must take is clear: investigation and, if (presumably appropriate, de-recognition of the CAA. As a former member of the ASA Board, I acknowledge this may be a novel decision to make, and it should certainly not be taken lightly, particularly given any concerns regarding free speech. Whilenumerous groups have been de-recognized in the past for failing to meet the requirement that their active membership consist of “at least 50% MIT students,”I am not immediately aware of any prior instance in which a group was de-recognized for a reason similar to the situation at hand. Nonetheless, the ASA must carry out its duty, whether it comes to recognizing student groups, approving student group funding, or de-recognizing student groups, in a viewpoint-neutral manner. As such, given the apparent facts of this matter, pending a fuller investigation with due process for those involved, and absent any public contrition from CAA leadership, the ASA Board has an obligation to de-recognize the CAA for having violated the ASA’s Bylaws deliberately and repeatedly in a manner that clearly goes beyond free speech protections. I strongly urge the ASA Board to perform its duty on this matter. And if the ASA Board fails to do so, I strongly urge a two-thirds majority of the student group representatives at the next ASA General Body Meeting, this upcoming spring, to vote in favor of de-recognition. Failure to do so would likely either encourage even more unchecked disruptive protests in the future or result in an even more pervasive double standard of regulations being frequently applied unevenly (and likely dependent on content . Both of these possibilities would ultimately further tarnish the credibility of MIT as an institution of higher education, further fracture our community, and perhaps even lead to furtherintrusive government investigations(which would arguably be warranted . As an aside, I want to be clear that the above is emphaticallynota call for those reading this to harass the members of the ASA Board on this matter, whichever way they may be leaning, particularly for readers who are not MIT students. Those who are motivated can always write up their own opinion pieces, after all. And for those readers feeling upset, you can always send your comments my way atchadqian@alum.mit.edu, if you want to tell me how stupid I am or whatever. “Practice what you preach” and all that jazz. Now, a diligent reader will probably have realized by this point that I have refrained from explicitly mentioning either “Israel” or “Palestine” in this article so far (external links notwithstanding . This exclusion is deliberate. On one level, I recognize that I am by no means an expert in the geopolitics or history of this region of the world. As such, I would, at best, end up sounding astoundingly dumb if I tried expounding on anything in detail. I just simply know thatthe atrocities that Hamas committed against innocent civilians on October 7were utterly, truly abhorrent and barbaric. I simply know that there are humanitarian rules of war that all sides must follow. And I simply know that the fog of war can be blindingly thick at times, withthe present conflict being no exception from this rule. I suppose that much at least is axiomatically obvious to me, but, hey, what do I know. Moreover, I believe the above principles I laid out apply universally. Indeed, if an ASA-recognized student group advocating for a view that I passionately held (“Students Against the SALT Deduction,” anyone? decided to violate MIT’s content-neutral “time, place, and manner” policies deliberately and repeatedly, I would hold the same position I expounded upon here. After all, selective application of regulations is corrosively antithetical to the proper, healthy functioning of a rules-based society, like our own. Of course, perhaps it would be remiss of me to not make at least one, somewhat more conclusive comment on the wider “context” of this situation. So, to that end, I will conclude this lengthy piece with a prayer for all Israelis and Palestinians: May, one day, they all live in peace. Free from suffering. Free from destruction. And free from terror. Chad Qian was a member of the MIT Class of 2020.

rice_thresher_2023_12,"ByThresher Editorial Board11/14/23 10:37pm After years of student protest and the final report from the Task Force on Slavery, Segregation and Racial Injustice, construction crews have removed the Founder’s Memorial statue from its pedestal. Willy’s statue will no longer be the centerpiece of the campus’ main quad. We certainly have our gripes with the redesign process. We worry that the construction and landscaping will go over schedule, impacting graduation — after all, Rice doesn’t have the best recent record of finishing large construction projects on time. Even if the redesign does finish by April, photographers will almost certainly face a huge crunch of graduation photoshoot requests. Good luck finding a shot without people in the background, if you get one at all. We also understand that the solution will not please everyone. The Thresher previously reported that Rice will move Willy’s statue into a grassy area between Sewall Hall and Lovett Hall and will create a space to provide information about William Marsh Rice, his ownership of enslaved people and his broader role in the institution of slavery. Some will disagree with the statue’s new location in the quad, especially its proximity to the Welcome Center and prospective students. Others will say the statue should never have been moved in the first place. Still, changes were made. In 2021, the Student Association passed a resolution to remove the statue from its prominent place. Students led years of protest and constructive conversations. Rice formed a task force that conducted groundbreaking research and produced a series of recommendations. And at the end of it all, student advocacy worked and Rice listened. Student activism should not end here. The Task Force on Slavery, Segregation and Racial Injustice has recommended another suite of actions for Rice to take to untangle itself from its legacy of institutional racism. Many underserved student groups are advocating for change, too, and Rice should listen to their voices. Rice prides itself on student governance. It’s refreshing to see student advocacy make a difference. We hope it continues. Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

wildcat_arizona_2023_5,"As the semester begins to wrap up, political cartoonist Dietz argues the University of Arizona has yet to help the community after this past year’s events or make amends for the toll the school continues to take on student and faculty mental health. Since the shooting last semester, University of Arizona President Dr. Robert C. Robbins and the school’s administration have been focused on recovery and mental health — but this commitment often feels like lip service. Healing from trauma takes an unknowable amount of time, even with medication and therapy. The administration’s wish for a speedy recovery is not only at odds with the human condition, but outright apathetic to it. In November 2022, it was reported byKGUNnews that the UA had removed a memorial for professor Thomas Meixner without consulting the Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences. When asked why it was taken down, the administration responded with, “best practices suggest that a month is a reasonable time to balance the comfort that many gain from the memorial’s presence to the perhaps daily reminder that can upset others as they grieve in their own ways.” I do not believe there has been any significant report or study that has ever suggested community-made memorials have a negative effect on those communities. It seems more likely that the university did not want a public reminder of tragedy to taint the university’s image. This failure to be honest with students and faculty has led to an increased burden on campus mental health. Many students and faculty that I have talked to continue to feel unsafe. Nobody seems to believe in any of Robbins’s promised changes. The administration’s refusal to ownup to its own failuresafter the shooting has weakened trust for handling future incidents.‬ This leaves students and faculty watching the continuing trend of school shootings with a heightened anxiety about their own safety. A recentlyleaked reportfrom the UA revealed that Black students are experiencing higher levels of emotional distress as well as higher levels of harassment. The UA only wishes to paint a picture of being a safe campus for diversity and inclusion,without engaging the accountabilityneeded to make it a reality. The administration is aware their primary demographic is affluent white students and their messages of racial equality and acceptance is ultimately to soothe white guilt rather than assure Black students’ concerns. Women on campus continue to feel unsafe and lack confidence in the administration’s ability to hold male students and staff accountable for harassment and assault. A young female opinions writer for theDaily Wildcatwas harassedand threatenedby male students. When she reported this to the Dean of Students office, the response was disorganized and delayed. Murad Dervish, charged with the killing of Meixner, even had a history of harassment on campus months before the shooting, yet had no problem returning to campus with a weapon. Multiplecomplaints were made to the UAabout this harassment, according to several hydrology and atmospheric sciences faculty members. Had the administration prioritized the safety by believing its own students and faculty when complaints were filed, then perhaps Dervish might not have had the opportunity to carry out his attack. The combination of economic burdens with traumatic events has only made things harder for working class students. Students with less financial means have fewer resources and less time to heal than those who are more well-off.‬ The UA’s Counseling and Psychological Services does not even acceptAHCCCS,Arizona’s Medicaid service that provides insurance for those in financial need. There is also the fact that many adjunct professors do not make a substantial amount of money teaching classes that they now feel unsafe in. So both students and faculty facing financial troubles are left with few options. The reason the university leaves its own campus community without support is likely because doing nothing makes it look like there is nothing wrong with campus culture as a whole, and campus culture is a major selling point for attracting new students. Robbins and his administration may send out a slew of emails about mental health, healing as a community and creating a safe space, but at the end of the day, they are just emails. Robbins was theformer CEOof Texas Medical Center prior to running the show here at the UA and it shows. The school’s administration under him is heartlessly cold to the human needs in a way that feels distinctly corporate. Every mistake, every failure, has a clear profit motive no matter how much mental health is invoked as a rationale. Robbins is great for the school’s wallet but a heavy burden for the collective health of the campus.

stanforddaily_2023_4,"On Dec. 2, 1998, when I was a Graduate Student Instructor at UC Berkeley, I walked away from my classroom and onto a picket line to strike for recognition of the Association of Graduate Student Employees union (ASGE/UAW . In the days leading up to the strike, University administrators argued that we were students, not workers; and that our paychecks were financial aid, not wages. Most concerning to me and many others, the University administratorstoldus repeatedly that unionization would damage the critical mentorship relationships with faculty that are so important to success in graduate school. It took two more years of negotiations, legal petitions and labor actions beforeUAW Local 2865gained hard-earned recognition, first representing all graduate student instructors — and now all academic student employees — across the University of California system. Unsurprisingly, the fears stoked by University of California administrators never materialized. For nearly a quarter century, UC graduate student employees have been represented through collective bargaining. Their work as unionized employees has not jeopardized their status as students. And graduate students continue to form productive mentoring and advising relationships with UC faculty. Why didn’t unionization of graduate student workers at the UC system affect faculty-student advising relationships? The simple reason is that the issues that drive student workers to seek union representation — affordability, healthcare and housing costs — are issues that faculty have little or no control over. At Stanford, a recent survey conducted by the Graduate Student Councilfoundthat 78% of respondents reported that they could not meet minimum standards for covering rent, health care, food and transportation. Anecdotally, these statistics are made real to me when, in advising and mentoring meetings, students confide to me that they are deferring needed health care or relying on local food banks for their groceries. It is tragic that in thefourth richest countyin the United States, and at Stanford University, with thefourth largest endowmentof any United States college or university, many of our graduate students are struggling to meet basic human needs. The situation is only getting worse: the recently-announced 2023-2024 cost-of-living adjustment for graduate student wagesfalls below inflation ratesfor the third year in a row. Affordability issues are affecting Stanford’s ability to attract, recruit and retain the most talented graduate students in our disciplines. And researchshowsthat financial concerns have a direct impact on graduate student motivation and degree completion. Data from the UC system validates this: since graduate student workers gained union recognition, doctoral degree completion hassteadily increasedacross the UC system. In other words, graduate student unionization appears to support, rather than detract from, graduate students’ academic progress. In the weeks and months ahead, Stanford administrators may trot out the same familiar anti-union rhetoric that UC Berkeley administrators used in the 1990s. If they do, don’t believe the hype. Collective bargaining doesn’t disrupt advising relationships between graduate students and faculty. Instead, it enhances our academic community by ensuring that graduate workers have the dignity of union representation when they negotiate with the University. That’s why I stand with the Stanford Graduate Workers Union — and why other faculty should too. Dr. Barbara L.

wildcat_arizona_2023_4,"Opinions writer Noor Haghighi argues that even if influencers start off posting with innocent intentions, they often quickly get endorsed by companies who turn their lives into a monetized show. This is not to say you should cut all ties with your favorite influencers, but relying on and idolizing them is a dangerous game. It’s 2018. You’ve come home from a boring day of AP Euro lecturing and waiting for your crush to Snapchat you back. Your bed has never looked so good. You plop yourself down for what you expect will be just an hour of chill time before doing homework. You locate YouTube on your home screen and find that Emma Chamberlain has posted a new video. In the thumbnail you see a scrunchie in her hair and a mason jar full of iced coffee in her hands. You see her do the same thing you just did: come home from school, grab a snack, lay down and reflect on the day that’s passed. “She is so relatable,” you think to yourself. And she was. She captured the simplicities of being a teenager: trying new foods and crafts, dying our hair and getting excited about music. She showed us how normal it was to have acne, she inspired us to buy our clothes second-hand, she made it okay to sit in front of a camera and express her vulnerability physically and emotionally. At the end of the day, she was just a teenage girl all alone in her bedroom or car, like the rest of us. Five years later, Chamberlain lives in amulti-million dollar homein L.A. and is no longer as relatable as she used to be. The Philz Coffee that once adorned her image is now replaced with her own line of wildly popular drinks calledChamberlain Coffee. In the last several years, she has been invited to a multitude ofred-carpet eventsincluding the Met Gala and international fashion weeks alongside celebrities. I doubt very many of her subscribers are 21-year-olds with the same luxuries. Yet what keeps the fans coming back? Most influencers started out as teens vlogging their ordinary days. At this stage, they are like the middle ground between us regulars and celebrities. They aren’t totally out of reach, but they still give us sparks of inspiration and assure us that we are not alone. However, this period of casual influencing doesn’t last long before they are swept away by countless offers. Chamberlain and those alike are just puppets of the influencer world being controlled by advertisements. She is a prime example of how most influencers begin posting innocently — maybe out of loneliness or as creative expression — but quickly get endorsed by companies who turn their lives into a monetized show. Take the D’Amelio family, for instance.Charli D’Ameliobegan posting short dancing videos on TikTok in the spring of 2019 and has now amassed over 150 million followers at the age of 18. Her family has a reality show on Hulu and all of them — down to her four dogs — seem to have a career of their own. It feels like nobody who is popular on YouTube or TikTok is posting just for fun anymore, and that means those on the other side of the screen cannot consume their media just for fun either. There are many costs that come with high media consumption, especially at a young, impressionable age. The influencers themselves are not necessarily the ones in control of this system to stardom, but they are feeding it by complying and promoting the material-driven agenda of the corporate realm. This is not to say you should cut all ties with your favorite influencers, but relying on them is a dangerous game. The effects of consuming their content on an everyday basis may go unnoticed — the thrift hauls, photo dumps and thank yous “for the birthday wishes” create only the illusion of relatability. You feel that you know this person and that they made this post for you. This practice leads us to fall into the same tendency of material-dependent happiness and what could be considered friend aversion. Rather than finding relatability with people in real-time, we seek it from somebody who has more than us. When thinking about the title of “influencer,” it’s a challenge to even pinpoint what makes them so influential in the first place. They are not scientists, many are not the artists or “creators” they are labeled as and they certainly are not philanthropists. The one thing they do have is attractiveness, and they typically have something that we are envious of. I’ve tried to put myself in the shoes of influencers and think: what are they to do but agree to a huge inflow of cash in exchange for minimal work? Anyone would do the same, right? Their compliance makes it okay for their followers to strive to do the same. The millions following influencers like Chamberlain and the D’Amelios are subject to have their individuality tarnished with the constant reminder to “buy this” and “try that,” especially when those trends are what everyone else is already playing into. The same risk runs with the tendency of hyper-labeling. The “clean girl” look is one of the most sought-out labels circling TikTok right now. Not only is it geared toward a certain demographic (of white girls , but it also categorizes a whole bunch of girls under one style rather than encouraging them to express themselves with a fearless mindset. Trends are one of the most problematic fuels of this influencer culture. Data shows that “YouTuber” is themost desirable careerby Generation Z, and that if the “opportunity was presented to them,” over half of them would become influencers. There seems to be a delusion amongst our age group that this sort of status is attainable, but the biggest triumphs of influencing are typically handed to white women who are already well-off to begin with. Alix Earle, one of TikTok’s most influential, has a page described byCosmopolitanas “filled with makeup, glamorous outfits, acne updates, college lifestyle, and pure chaos. ” Those “acne updates” do not exactly make her relatable, though. For one, it’s nearly impossible to find a video of hers where her face is not completely acne-free. Even if she does happen to address a tiny pimple on her cheek every now and then, the rest of the time she is documenting rides in private jets and parties with expensive attire. Earle and other influencers alike are so obviously separating themselves from the rest of us who are in a lower tax bracket. But I find it frustrating that their millions of followers can’t seem to catch on. In many cases, those followers are too young to catch on. When I was 15, I was too young to catch on myself. And, at that point, TikTok had not amassed the power it has today. With its accessibility, addictiveness and lack of age restrictions, TikTok especially makes it easy to lure in teenagers at the formative age that they are establishing their identities. Young users cannot be blamed for the media they consume when their vulnerability is capitalized on. Still, there are users at the college age and beyond who blindly conform to influencer culture as well and it is imperative that they realize this toxicity. There is no use in worshiping women like Earle who make it seem like the lavish life is available to anyone who wants it. They make being white and having conventionally beautiful features the expected norm. Without those features, however, you are not as desired by mainstream companies and you arenot as likely to be offered the same amount of money. This also begs the question of who we are allowing to be the role models for teenage girls today. After all, it is likely that more teens know Chamberlain’s name over, say,Malala Yousafzai’sorGreta Thunberg’s. Take it from my own Instagram friends: 103 of the people I follow on Instagram follow Chamberlain, while only 39 follow Thunberg and six follow Yousafzai. In many ways, it is easier to follow an influencer who posts her outfits and her morning pastries over an influencer who informs and calls for action on social media. But what many do not realize is the long-term damage of idolizing Chamberlain, Earle and those alike. Their content maintains the cycle of unhealthy comparison andself-harm amongst young women. And the ones who claim to be relatable despite their unfathomable wealth are especially dangerous. Young women should be encouraged to seek inspiration from individuals who are true influencers with the social awareness to combat injustice — rather than perpetuate it. In some cases, popular internet influencersappear progressiveand encourage performative activism amongst their followers without that negatively connoted label, of course. They change their profile picture to show text that reads “Black Lives Matter” and they repost progressive infographics on their stories. But how much do they care about and contribute to such causes in private? To them, it doesn’t seem to matter how many people suffer through adversity while they continue to be praised and given more money. Part of the fault, again, lies within the followers. Why do they applaud their internet idols for simple, oftentimes useless reposts when they could be following stories from minorities who actually experience injustice firsthand or environmentalists who actively support their cause? At the same time that I critique influencer culture, I also wonder what its shelf life is. How many more years will we continue to scroll, flooded by sponsored day-in-the-lives and makeup tutorials? Influencing is not a guaranteed pathway and it’s not sustainable either. Once enough people attempt the influencer life and realize they stand no chance at stardom, it will fail to prosper in the way it once could. Call me traditional, but a lot more can be done from person to person rather than from person to screen. Take a break from double-clicking and scrolling every now and then to think about which influencer is sparking your interest. They are closer to the T.V. characters you watch every day than they are to you and nothing about their lives is attainable. It is the responsibility of us users to shift our focus on bettering the tangible world rather than dreaming of a rich girl’s heaven that only exists in our lives as pixels.

stanforddaily_2023_5,"I was disappointed in 2021 to read that Stanford had been sued by a number of its athletes when the school, without warning, told them it had decided to drop 11 varsitysportsteams. Those sports included men’s volleyball, wrestling and rowing. Women were to lose sports like synchronized swimming, rowing and fencing. President Marc Tessier-Lavigne, Provost Persis Drell and Athletic Director Bernard Muir said the cut was a budget necessity, and was needed to keep Stanford “competitive” with other schools. That turned out not to be true. In fact, the school rejected alumni financing of the sports. I was further angered when I read that Tessier-Lavigne may have co-authored a number of scientific papers with“manipulated images.”I was then saddened to read about Stanford soccer playerKatie Meyer, who had committed suicide last March after a badly botched disciplinary action Stanford attempted to take against her. Her parents filed a lawsuit against Stanford in October. These are some of the more serious scandals involving the school in the last three years. There have been less severe missteps taken by those who are supposedly in the business of running an elite, world renowned university, but even these smaller mistakes seem to indicate a larger problem. One of my classmates (I graduated in 1970 complains that the administration is of late “rudderless,” stumbling from one crisis to another. He may not make his annual donation to the school as a result. I think it is time to ask: exactly who manages Stanford? And how are they making decisions? Is it the President? The Board of Trustees? Or a small group of individuals known only to a few? By themselves, some recent actions taken by Stanford were somewhat humorous. The school has been the butt of jokes by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and numerous other major and local papers. For example, the IT department came out with its“Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative”to be used on its websites. The national media had a field day with this action, especially when it recommended no longer using the word “American.” Some folks may have found humor in the suspension of the Stanford Tree after the Washington State home football game, when the Tree displayed the now widely-viewed hand-made “Stanford Hates Fun” banner (oh, there goes the band again . I did not find humor in the suspension because the Tree was telling the truth (please see the article“Stanford’s War on Social Life”in the Palladium Magazine by a graduate student, Ginevra Davis, who makes a strong case for the fact that Stanford’s administration has arbitrarily and quietly clamped down on student social activities since 2012 . The Tree was suspended by a “faceless student committee” assisted by the band’s musical director. Not only that, students coming to the next home football gamewere searched, and even had to lift their shirts to see if they had “objectionable banners.” For more serious misconduct by Stanford, I encourage Daily readers to look at the contents of the lawsuit filed by the 240 students who were members of the 11 sports Stanford wanted to cut without any warning. Stanford changed its tune when a lawsuit was filed, alleging a lot of embarrassing conduct by Stanford, and reinstated all of the sports. The student lawsuit, “Guden, Bicknell, Lietzke, Stemmet et al v. the Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University (aka Stanford ,” alleged that for years the school had planned to drop those sports, but did not tell any students. The morerecent lawsuit, which is even more upsetting, has been filed by the parents of Katie Meyer, who state that Stanford acted improperly in its attempt to discipline Katie, a member of the women’s soccer team. Katie supposedlyspilled coffeeon a Stanford varsity football player who assaulted a friend of hers (he got to play out the season, and was never disciplined . Stanford knew that Katie was struggling after she was brought into Stanford’s byzantine and draconian student discipline process. On the last day, or actually the evening of the last day Katie could be disciplined, Stanford sent an email to her saying they were placing her diploma on hold three months short of graduation, and proceeding to a disciplinary hearing. Her parents claim she could have lost her student status, her membership on the soccer team, her captainship of the team and other benefits of a Stanford degree. She desperately tried to contact a Stanford representative, but it was after hours, and there was only a phone number to call. No one answered. Notify her at night when no one is around? This seems cowardly and unfair. She took her own life later that night. For many years now, Stanford had decided that the student disciplinary process was too harsh. So what did Stanford do? It studied the issue. There had been many complaints from students, parents, mental health professionals and even Stanford faculty that the process needed an overhaul. Unfortunately for Katie, it was never done. Meyers v. Stanford alleges, if true, incredibly heartless conduct by Stanford. Stanford has, in fact, changed. It has clamped down on all forms of student social activity on campus, starting withfraternitiesand the Stanfordband. In doing so, the school has not even met minimal standards of good management in dealing with its most precious resource, the students. What is going on? Maybe the following can shed some light. Athletic Director Muir came in 2014, from a college where hecut a number of sports teams. He failed to make the same kind of cut here. Persis Drell, Dean of the School of Engineering from 2014-17, and Provost since 2017, tried tocut funding to the Stanford University Pressin 2019, but withdrew in the face of widespread criticism. She said she had not “anticipated the reaction” to her decision. And along with Muir, she failed to cut the 11 Stanford teams. The University has even hired a former Harvard administrator to clamp down on student activities here, after heunsuccessfully tried to do soat Harvard, only when he was faced with a lawsuit (Sound familiar? . President Tessier-Lavigne was hired by Stanford, I assume by the trustees, in 2016, despite a cloud over him from allegations ofimproper research publicationsdating back some years. The Board was forced to investigate those claims recently, when The Daily raised the issue. The Board of Trustees started to do its own investigation, but The Daily found out that one of the trustees hadinvested 18 million dollarsin Tessier-Lavigne’s business. So, I ask, who is running Stanford?"
rice_thresher_2023_13,"ByAviva Presser Aiden11/10/23 6:07pm Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. In thearticle“‘All out for Palestine’ protest sees 2,000 at Houston City Hall” from Oct. 17, Associate Vice Provost Catherine Clack discusses the Rice Students for Justice in Palestine sign-making event at the Multicultural Center in the wake of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in Israel. She states “... how is this something that we should oppose when it s an exercise of free speech?” I respect the complexity of issues related to the Middle East and recognize the importance of representing a spectrum of views. But while free speech is a cornerstone of academic discourse, it is imperative that we distinguish between fostering open dialogue and supporting dangerous rhetoric. The slogan “From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free,” prominently displayed in the group s signage, was popularized in the 1960s by the Palestinian Liberation Organization. It helped the PLO — recognized at the time as aterrorist organization by the U.S. State Department— amplify its calls for the dismantling of the state of Israel. As thePalestinian National Charterof 1968 said, “Palestine, with the boundaries it had during the British Mandate i.e., from the river to the sea , is an indivisible territorial unit … Claims of historical or religious ties of Jews with Palestine are incompatible with the facts of history.” The official policy of Hamas, aU.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizationwhich conducted the Oct. 7 attacks, includes the slogan almost verbatim. Hamas’ 2017Document of General Principles and Policiesstates, “Hamas rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.” Other signs read “Resistance is not Terrorism,” and “Resistance is Justified.” They seem to cast the Oct. 7 Hamas attack as legitimate resistance. Osama Bin Laden’sLetter to Americaused that rationale to justify 9/11. Attacks targeting civilians, even labeled as “resistance,” are unequivocally acts of terrorism. Such actions should never find endorsement or support within our community, even under the banner of free speech. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

thetech_mit_2023_0,"Therecent outbreak of antisemitismat MIT and other campuses puts into stark relief the limits of administrative bureaucracies’ ability to solve the problems of human relationships and tribalism. With great fanfare in 2021, the Reif administration announced its massive Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI initiative which by some counts added up to about a hundred professional administrators with some variation of DEI in their titles. Though this initiative was subsequently rebranded “Belonging, Achievement, and Composition” (BAC after the administration apparently realized the incoherence of the DEI rubric with the Institute’s basic culture and mission, the bureaucrats remained. In addition, the administration enlarged and reorganized the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response (IDHR office, adding another couple of dozen professional administrators. How much was spent on all of this? The employment site Glassdoorreportsthat the low end for salaries of Assistant Deans at MIT is about $100K. Add up salaries of over a hundred people at this level, their support staff, benefits for all, and ordinary office overhead at average Institute burden rates, and a $20 million annual price tag for all this feel-good bureaucracy (on top of existing student support such as counseling, psychiatric services, etc. seems like a very fair rough estimate of the total cost. Do we all feel “belonging” and “inclusion? This of course leads us to last month’s melee in Lobby 7 between Palestinian and Israeli supporters, and widely reported concerns primarily among the latter, ofharassment, intimidation, and the like.The consequences for actions contrary to Institute regulations will hopefully be resolved by the Committee on Discipline. Independently, it seems important to point out the utter failure of this massive bureaucracy to achievetheir ownstated objectives: From BAC: “The BAC initiative seeks to build a community at MIT where everyonefeelswelcome, valued, and respected, regardless of their background, identity, or experiences. This includes fostering a sense of connection and belonging among students, faculty, staff, and postdocs.” From IDHR: “The objective of MIT s Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office (IDHR is topreventand address discrimination and discriminatory harassment across the Institute.” While the DEI/BAC/IDHR bureaucracy is producing training courses for faculty, students, and staffwarningthat deadnaming a person who has undergone sex transition is a violent act, there arecrowds chanting about violence to ethnic groupsand a potential community brawl in lobby 7 between Israeli and Palestinian supporters. If the conflict in the Middle East continues, this could be only the first such occurrence. A widely publicizedlettersigned by hundreds of Jewish and Israeli members of the MIT community attests to the fact that they do notfeelwelcome, valued, and respected. It’s not clear that the supporters of Palestine do either, based onChancellor Nobles s statementsthat Islamophobia will be addressed in Standing Together Against Hate (STAH . So now we are to believe that the solution, however well intentioned, is STAH: that STAH will attend to those identities (somehow overlooked by DEI/BAC/IDHR. The evidence is incontrovertible that these bureaucracies have failed to allow (at least our Jewish community to “feel welcome, valued and respected” or to “prevent and address discrimination and harassment” as well as having seemingly neglected emerging Islamophobia. Obviously, the current outbreak of antisemitism must be addressed and opposed directly, but the premise that more bureaucratic acronyms and expensive overhead can resolve human relationships needs to be totally re-examined. MIT already has the highest administrative cost per student of any university in the Ivy Plus group, at $59,506,according to the most recent financial reportsthat all universities whose students receive federal aid must report to the US Department of Education; the average for the group is about $27,000. Before we create another misguided bureaucracy—andparticularly before we select the next Institute Community and Equity Officer,this failure of the existing administrative offices should be recognized by an immediate hiring freeze and a thorough examination of these programs by an objective outside party. A potential model for such an inquiry is the retention of a major law firm as MIT did in the Epstein affair, which resulted in an overhaul of the Institute’s policies for accepting gifts. President Kornbluth, having inherited this bureaucracy, should have a free hand in reshaping it in light of recent events, and must not feel beholden to what in my opinion is the poor advice she has apparently received from these quarters. If current trends do not change, there is no apparent end to the creation of administrative bloat with ever more offices perceived to be responsive to discrete identities, denoted by ever multiplying acronyms. In the long run, I can only hope that we move back toward a culture that seeks to attract talent without discrimination from wherever it may come, and that counsels us all to respect each another simply as individuals who, in Dr. King’s words, “will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” And, along the way, let us reduce administrative costs so they are no more than those at peer institutions and add $30,000 or so in annual per student savings back into student aid!

state_press_2023_30,"Banning TikTok on ASU s campus would hinder student expression and prevent student organizations from reaching the student body. Universities across the nation are banning TikTok from campus WiFi networks and devices, and half of U.S. states have blocked access to the app on government devices. ASU has not yet imposed any such restrictions but may face pressure from Arizona s government if it passesHouse Bill 2416, introduced by Arizona Rep. Matt Gress, R-4, which would ban the app on state-issued devices. Banning TikTok is, at best, an adequate response to secure data. At worst, it’s a response that risks the future of ASU student organizations and their contributions to campus vitality. Austin Ashburn, a senior studying journalism and mass communication and the social media director for ASU’s Downtown Phoenix residential hall Taylor Place, stressed TikTok’s utility to student organizations. “TikTok is the app where you can be the most innovative in how you market your (student organization stuff,” Ashburn said. “TikToks are really useful in spreading the word, especially because you can be a little more quirky with them, so you can relay information in a more fun, inventive and innovative way.” Limiting student organizations’ outreach also leads to less student involvement. “A lot of clubs use TikTok to promote their events, and without that, it’s a lot harder to promote,” said Sophie Warnock, a freshman studying fashion and a member ofConfetti, an LGBTQ+ student group on the Downtown Phoenix campus. “I definitely think that less people would know about them (without TikTok .” Prominent ASU organizations like theResidence Hall AssociationandUndergraduate Student Governmentuse TikTok to reach more students, Ashburn said. Both are known for amplifying student concerns and communicating student needs to ASU. “They’re (RHA and USG always really thankful whenever I reshare or repost an event that they’re hosting, especially on TikTok,” Ashburn said. “If you’re promoting on TikTok, there are more opportunities.” RHA and USG are already popular, somewhat cushioned against the impacts of a sweeping TikTok ban. On the other hand, smaller clubs that grapple with discoverability challenges would suffer more since they lack the luxury of an established campus presence. Yulianna Arias, a freshman studying medical studies and a member of the student dance clubKoDE, testifies to its positive impact on her and other members. “It’s (KoDE usually just a club where you can go in there and have fun dancing to songs and they’re (dance instructors teaching you different dances,” Arias said. “Having a TikTok page also helps spread the club itself to other people who are interested.” Although universities fear TikTok’s cybersecurity risks, banning the app doesn’t solve our deep-rooted data privacy problem. According to theBrookings Institution, many U.S.-based companies collect and compile the exact same consumer data, but we don’t see universities booting those digital firms and their services off of campus as a result. The only thing banning a popular app would accomplish is creating additional, unnecessary friction between students and the University. ASU prides itself on inclusion, a tenet that is central to student organizations across the four campuses, organizations that either directly advocate for the student body or provide safe spaces for students to find community. Limiting their social media impact limits the number of students whose lives could be enriched by the supportive culture of ASU’s student organization scene. Part of inclusion is encouraging students to express themselves. TikTok is a way for students to connect with each other across campuses, bonding over similar passions and a shared identity as ASU peers. TikTok lets us do everything from spreading awareness about important social causes and sharing mental health resources to laughing over silly soundbites and participating in lighthearted trends. Although data privacy concerns are valid, banning TikTok would not be the best route to assuage those fears or solve cybersecurity issues. All a ban would do is potentially undermine student organizations, the lifeblood of campus vitality and the reason why ASU is a home away from home for so many people.

state_press_2023_6,"Telling someone you are currently a humanities major is just another way of saying you don t mind being unemployed for the rest of your life. But that s not the case, and it s time to give up the myth that studying humanities is a waste of time or a hindrance in the job market. The economic reality is much more complicated but still favorable for humanities majors, especially in an ever-changing and fickle job landscape. Jeffrey Cohen, the dean of humanities at the ASU College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, said that part of why humanities aren t taken seriously by students is that they re hard to define, making it difficult to assess their value. Students don t always know what the humanities consist of, Cohen said. I always think of the humanities as being the study of the human adventure across time, culture and place. It s also (about what makes us human and pushes us toward what makes us humane. Cohen said this theme across humanities studies – which include disciplines like linguistics, philosophy, history, literature and English – makes students critically think about the past in order to create a better future. This grueling process of close reading, digesting centuries of intellectual expression and then learning to critique it is key to humanities majors academic success. But it also instills a combination of skills that entice employers. There is a cluster of skills that, when you bring them together, are humanities-aligned skills, Cohen said. That s what makes people strong job candidates because it is that combination of creativity with great writing and great research and global citizenship that can really well-position you for a career. Data shows that STEM-based degree holders from ASU initially earn a higher starting salary than their humanities counterparts. However, the median salaries for ASU humanities majors range from $43,342 to $53,732 five years after graduation, with the number increasing to $52,573 to $70,000 after 10 years,according to the U.S. Census Bureau. For reference, the national yearly median income in 2022 was around $40,000. The economic reality isn t all rainbows and butterflies for humanities majors. But if the humanities is something students feel passionate about, it can still reap rewards. Dennis Hoffman, the director of theL. William Seidman Research Instituteat the W. P. Carey School of Business, said that while humanities majors start off with lower salaries than their STEM peers, there is still room for growth. If your passion is in the humanities, you don t have to feel like there s no jobs for you when you get out, Hoffman said. You just have to be flexible. Employers want to hire smart people that can solve problems for them. Hoffman s daughter, who went to ASU, opted to take economics through the liberal arts school rather than through the business school and used this academic background to land a senior HR position at Indeed – an example of how transferable humanities-aligned skills can be. So leveraging off that kind of skill set, problem-solving and presenting yourself as you have historical context, I think it s a very valuable tool, Hoffman said. I m quite a bull on humanities education. Risha Das, a senior studying mathematics and mechanical engineering, said that being involved in humanities throughModel UNbalances her STEM-heavy education with needed perspective. I think our current standard for engineering education across universities and communities can be really isolated in its training and focus too much on how to innovate rather than what innovation can do for those in need, Das said in an emailed statement. But Model UN and its focus on the humanities has helped me grasp the moral implications and intersectionality of engineering ... and the responsibility we have as engineers to ensure that impact is for the better. Das said this experience helps her and other students foster empathy and connections with the global community. Taking in the humanities through Model UN helped her problem solve for a better future, the same trait that Cohen mentioned being important for companies looking to hire. The humanities can enrich ASU students skill sets, making them higher-quality candidates in a highly competitive job market scene. As layoffs become the norm and employers can be fickle about whom they hire, it s more important than ever for students to build skills that they can easily transfer to any job. Whether it s picking up an extra philosophy class or adding on a minor, it s time to appreciate the humanities for what they can offer us. Edited by Jasmine Kabiri, Sadie Buggle and Angelina Steel.

stanforddaily_2023_84,"QueridaComunidad, The images of students carrying signs using profanity against El Centro and Centro Director Elvira Prieto and calling for staff firing from the May 5thincident during Cafecito at El Centro were devastating. Intimidation, name calling and aggressive confrontation are not how we resolve differences in ourcomunidad.The list of demands, protest signs and the calls to remove El Centro’s Director, Elvira Prieto, were difficult to understand and inconsistent with the spirit and mission of the Centro and Casa Zapata. As an alumnae, Stanford volunteer and parent of two recent Stanford graduates, I have seen Elvira’s hard work and commitment to students. I have also admired her passion for preserving our art, culture, traditions and history at Stanford. I am proud to have such a strong and committed advocate for our comunidad. In her roles as Director of El Centro and Resident Fellow of Casa Zapata Elvira has been a selfless advocate for ourcomunidad.Throughout her tenure Elvira has led the Centro with integrity, compassion, and humility. Elvira works hard to create a safe space for all students to gather. In her role as Director of El Centro and RF of Casa Zapata, Elvira has been a zealous advocate for increased resources, administrative support and other services for ourcomunidad.We must demand that Elvira be treated with the dignity and respect that she has earned. I have known Elvira since the early 90’s doing the hard work in the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán (MEChA and leading the Hunger Strike of 1994, as well as dealing with the fallout and its aftermath. These efforts eventually led to the creation of the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE . Building on the legacy and the sacrifices of our ancestors and of the generations of MEChistas before us, Elvira served as a student leader in the fight for increased support services for students, culturally relevant educational opportunities, and increased resources that ourcomunidadenjoys today. She put her life on the line and has dedicated her career since then to preserving these precious resources. Elvira remains steadfast in her commitment to ourcomunidad. During Elvira’s tenure as Director of El Centro programming, staff composition and our physical spaces have evolved to reflect the increasing diversity of our community. She has woven a beautiful tapestry rich with the colorful intersectionality of our community and based on our common values ofrespeto, cariño y dignidad.We must protect our resources and support those doing the hard work to preserve our place at Stanford. We must also remember that El Centro and Casa Zapata belong to all of us. These spaces belong to the current students holding those spaces, the staff working to support them, the faculty who help build community, and to generations of alumni who risked their academic careers and personal well-being as students and continue to come back to campus year after year to give of their time, talents, and funds. El Centro also belongs to future generations who will continue to build on our legacy. Let us learn each other’s histories and experiences and honor the struggle of those whose blood, sweat and tears laid the foundation for ourcomunidadat Stanford. As we have throughout our history, let’s draw our strength from one another and come together with dignity and respect to resolve our differences.El pueblo unido, jamas será vencido!

crimson_2023_158,"If you were at the Harvard-Yale game last year, we’ve probably met. But I didn’t give you my standard Harvard introduction. I was too busy skipping through seating sections, taking thousands of pictures with crimson-clad fans, and flapping obnoxiously large polyester wings to the stadium’s music selection. I piloted Harvard’s first unofficial mascot: a turkey. It was silly. And it was frickin’ awesome. Honestly, it was a highlight of college. The turkey suit brought huge smiles to toddlers demanding hugs and high fives. Older alumni couldn’t help but chuckle, saying how glad they were that our school finally had a mascot. Hordes of undergraduates in the student section bombarded me on the stairs with selfies and chants: “Turkey! Mr. Turkey!” After the game, friends texted me photos of their parents ‘meeting the turkey.’ Harvard’s Instagram posted a video with me leading the crowd in a chant. And I later heard that the camera crew was trying to catch me on the national broadcast between commercial breaks. The reception of the mascot was overwhelmingly, undeniably positive. The pilot madefront-page news in the Boston Globe. Then, the cover of the Class of 2023 yearbook was a family of turkeys strutting past Johnston Gate — too apt to be a coincidence. It was the hype that a weird, dumb mascot should get. Which is why, during the lead-up to The Game, it was so frustrating to see much of the Harvard community turn against it. Throughout my years here, I’ve been blown away with my fellow Harvard students’ constant creativity and new ideas. I’ve seen classmates stage avant-garde thesis productions, start their own small businesses, and run for political office with new, fresh platforms. As individuals, we are so open to change. But the second we feel like our opinions may go against the tide of what is cool or expected, we find it easier to upvote hate posts on Sidechat than get behind something new. I’ve read and heard every insult about how the mascot was a stupid idea. A turkey doesn’t represent us! Nobody will take us seriously! But that’s exactly the point. We take ourselves way too seriously. We’ve found a golden ticket to this shiny Wonka factory of a university, but we too often forget that we’re still kids at heart — college kids who want to have some fun. In many ways, we are collectively working against the collegiate energy we truly seek. We roast Harvard for having no school spirit, but we leave thousands of seats empty at our varsity athletic games. We grumble about the lack of College-wide events, but we never fail to make fun of the Yardfest headliner. I’m tired of negativity and complaints being our great unifier. Instead, for once and for all, let’s rally around a mascot. To clarify, this would not replace the Crimson name or brand — we won’t be saying “Go Turkeys!” I’m talking about a person in a suit at Harvard events, that’s all. Think the tree associated with the Stanford University Cardinal or the elephant with the University of Alabama Crimson Tide. It can be unofficial. It can be crusty. It can be weird. But it has to be something. And although I’m personally a fan of the feathered menaces terrorizing the Yard, it doesn’t have to be a turkey. Let’s come together and create a figure that is unique, represents Harvard, and, most importantly, is timeless. As much as Remy the Cat is a unifying symbol for students now, a full-grown adult in an orange tabby catsuit might raise some eyebrows years after our favorite feline has passed on. A mascot that will outlive us shouldn’t be an inside joke only shared between a few classes of undergrads. I’ve since graduated. I won’t be on campus to carry on this silly mascot crusade. But I truly hope that doesn’t stop someone else from trying. I am not the first person to argue for a mascot, and I have a feeling that I won’t be the last. Generations of Harvard students before me havecreated initiatives, started popularFacebook events, andwritten op-edsin The Crimson in favor of a mascot. Some of them, I should say, specifically wanted the turkey too. It’s up to you all now. Embrace the weird! Take yourselves a little less seriously. And let’s actually make it happen. So that in 20 years, when your own toddlers are posing with a funny mascot at Harvard-Yale, you can say you were there when it all began. Oh, before I forget. If you only met the turkey and not the guy behind the mask, here’s a proper intro: My name’s Felix, Social Studies alum, and I want a Harvard mascot. You should too. Felix Bulwa ’23 is a graduate of Currier House."
rice_thresher_2023_44,"ByMahmoud Al-Madi4/18/23 9:15pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Editor’s Note: Parts of this opinion piece rely on eyewitness accounts and are, as a result, subjective. The Thresher could not independently verify any claims made about the events of any Beer Bike race. In Beer Bike 2021, when there were four heats of three teams each, the Jones College men’s bike team finished with the fastest time of all the residential colleges, a net time that was at least three seconds faster than the Hanszen College men’s team–which was affirmed by the original results produced by the Rice Program Council, the entity that organizes Beer Bike – earning Jones men the uncontested first place finish they deserved. However, the Hanszen race was fully recorded from one Rice Athletics camera while the Jones race was recorded using two Rice Athletics cameras which had a three-second lag between them when aired on the livestream that recorded the races–as fully documented and proven in an email I sent to RPC on April 20, 2021, which is still available today. Hanszen took advantage of the lag in the livestream and contested the results to claim that Jones and Hanszen times were equivalent, and RPC responded by editing Jones’ and Hanszen’s times, tying them to the millisecond, earning Hanszen an unfair win. When I emailed RPC with proof of the lag which should have invalidated its flawed adjustments to the results, it evaded its responsibility to maintain integrous results by simply saying “RPC has historically not allowed any petitions to be re-petitioned.” Here we are in 2023 finding ourselves in a very similar situation with the women’s Beer Bike results, except that we still have the capacity to rectify the flawed final standings for the women’s race. At this year’s Beer Bike, Jones women completed the race with the fastest time of all the residential colleges, which should have earned them the uncontested win they deserved. However, during the women’s warm-up, as a Jonesian woman was slowly passing a McMurtry College biker on the inside of the track, I witnessed from a few feet away the Murt biker panic and swerve slightly into the Jonesian’s rear wheel. Since bikes are more susceptible to losing balance upon contact with the front wheel, the Murt rider crashed. Based on an appeal that not even the McMurtry bike captains claimed to have submitted, Jones women were penalized with an arbitrarily assigned 25 seconds for “excessive weaving” placing them third in the final standings–even after getting back 10 seconds from their own appeal for other errors. The only penalty related to “excessive weaving” in the RPC rules is a 10 second penalty. If Jones women were to deserve the penalty, which they absolutely did not, they would still be in first place. RPC not only failed to properly investigate the events that led to the crash, but they unjustly assigned a fully arbitrary penalty, which is questionable in and of itself. Let’s consider this: what is the point of results if the final standings are heavily influenced by arbitrary and poorly reviewed decisions? If Beer Bike was purely in the spirit of a campus-wide celebration and standings did not matter at all, then we could do away with the results altogether. However, I am not sure that Beer Bike is solely a campus-wide celebration, as demonstrated by the fact that virtually all the residential colleges on campus trained and prepared for race day, which hints to me that there must be an element of athletic competition in Beer Bike. Instead, we need integrous results that fairly capture the performance and events of race day. If the current RPC leadership is unable to produce such results, then I propose that they delegate that responsibility to a separate committee that is willing to do so. Otherwise, a lack of such results is a complete disregard of the weeks of time and commitment that bike teams across campus dedicated towards preparing for Beer Bike. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

state_press_2023_26,"Members of the public slowly start to fill Desert Financial Arena at a men s basketball game on Saturday, Dec. 31, 2022, in Tempe. Contradicting statements from President Michael Crow and Athletic Director Ray Anderson aboutDesert Financial Arenaare concerning and unacceptable, as athletes at ASU depend upon it to succeed in their sports. In a meeting with The State Press, Crow spoke about comments made by Anderson in February 2022 to Arizona Sports Bickley and Marotta about Desert Financial Arena, in which Anderson said the arena is in “dire need” of improvements. I don t know what he meant by dire, Crow said in the meeting. You ve been there. It s completely functional. It s actually a fine facility and just needs some updates. On that note, one may believe that DFA is completely functional if one thinks that an arena being functional means that a basketball can bounce in it and thousands of people can sit on folding arena seats. In reality, that is not functionality, especially not at the high standards ASU facilities should be held to. The air conditioning at DFA is in need of an update, and Crow said an upgrade would cost about $25 million. Seating, handrails and locker room improvements were also mentioned by Crow as possible updates. READ MORE:ASU president talks Pac-12 media rights, conference realignment, Coyotes vote Air conditioning, seating, handrails and locker rooms are basic parts of what would determine a Division I sports arena to be functional. Those features would be in a functional high school basketball gym! If those aspects even need to be brought up for potential updates, that is not a good sign. Warren Brannoch, a Sun Devil fan and Youngker High School head freshman football coach, expressed dissatisfaction with his experience at DFA. Brannoch said handicapped seats were not available ahead of time for the ASU men s basketball home game against Arizona, and he was told to show up early to the game to get them. He said when looking for those seats for his parents, there were only 10 handicapped seats available in the arena. He also said his sister had to have his one-year-old nephew be changed on the ticket office floor because there weren t adequate family restrooms available. It s astonishing to me that a University of that stature doesn t have the facilities it needs for its fans, especially, you know, handicapped, or whoever they be, of all types of ages, to come to an arena and enjoy a game, Brannoch said. ASU pres Michael Crow does not think Desert Financial Arena is in dire need of upgrades like Ray Anderson said a year ago.And then he compares the basketball team using the direly functional arena to ... Kristaps Porzingis?From@statepress:https: t.co/VKgYDPkouTpic.twitter.com/d6IEX2HI9X Crow said the facility does not determine if we win basketball games at all. That is ridiculous. Facility quality affects teams before they even play, when it comes to recruiting, marketing and everything in between. Yet, who could say they re surprised? Outside of DFA, there have beenreportsof mold and damage at ASU dorms. ASU has alsothreatenedto push the costs of dorm damages onto dorm residents. Crow s comments are part of a wider trend of neglect of student facilities. If ASU athletics and academics want to be a source of excellence, its facilities need to be adequate at the very least, or, as Crow said, functional. But, let s be clear about one thing: these problems aren t just a Crow issue or an Anderson issue. It s a problem with the approach to public education that has led ASU to have only 12% of its 2023 gross revenue come from state appropriations. ASU fundamentallyrunsas a private business. It cuts costs, cuts corners and neglects its facilities because that is incentivized by the way it is funded. If it received a strong budget from the state of Arizona and was empowered to ensure all students and athletes have the tools they need to succeed, we would never see problems like mold in dorms and outdated air conditioning systems in an arena located in one of the hottest places in the U.S. This isn t to offer an excuse for Crow and Anderson. They both need to be on the same page about the University and its athletics, and they both need to prioritize what is best for the people who study, live and work here. ASU students and supporters should demand that Crow and Anderson get on the same page about ASU s athletic facilities and advocate for a stronger state budget that helps empower the University to take care of its buildings.

stanforddaily_2023_92,"In their coverage of Thursday’s Faculty Senate debate around the presence of Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Mercer on the Hoover Institution’s Board of Overseers, TheStanford Dailyand theStanford Reportoffered a number of quotations from President Marc Tessier-Lavigne and Hoover Director Condoleezza Rice that form the basis of this essay. Murdoch had been criticized for facilitating the spread of dangerousmisinformationabout the 2020 Presidential election. He had admitted as much undersworn depositionduring the defamation lawsuit brought against Murdoch’s Fox News by Dominion Voting Machines. Mercer was criticized because her own media empire has promoted the dangerous “Great Replacement Theory,” a virulentlyantisemitic, white supremacist doctrine that holds that white people are being “replaced” by Jewish people and other racial groups. This theory has been evoked byvariousmassmurderersin themanifestos. Aresolutionwas presented that “the association of Rebekah Mercer and Rupert Murdoch in all positions of responsibility or honor at Stanford University be terminated due to their promulgation of dangerous, racist, and antisemitic disinformation.” Although I have strong objections to Mercer, I have chosen to focus on Murdoch because his case allows us to adjudicate whether Stanford does or does not condone misinformation. Based on the test case presented yesterday, apparently it does, via this sleight of hand —misinformation is welcomed at Stanford if it is framed as simply one viewpoint amongst many and protected as free speech. The repetition of exact phrases and terms leads one to believe that Tessier-Lavigne and Rice are reading from the same script: President Marc Tessier-Lavigne urged the senate to vote against the resolution, calling it “chilling” and an imposition of “institutional orthodoxy” during the Faculty Senate meeting. (Daily “The Senate just reaffirmed its commitment to academic freedom ,” Tessier-Lavigne said, referencing apreviousfaculty senate meeting. “For the senate to adopt this resolution would be to set itself up as a thought police.” (Daily Tessier-Lavigne spoke against the motion, which he said in effect calls for the Senate to act as an institutional body to censor two overseers. “Free expression of ideas is the lifeblood of the University and it’s essential to our research and teaching missions,” he said. (SR “The senate’s foundational statement of academic freedom holds that expression of the widest range of viewpoints should be encouraged free from institutional orthodoxy and from internal and or external coercion,” Hoover Director Condoleezza Rice said. (Daily “The University has been very clear that we are going to uphold not just academic freedom, but standards of freedom of speech,” Rice added. “And I would say that freedom of the press goes along with that.” (SR The problem is, even if we frame this as a free speech issue, we find that free speech is not completely free. InBrandenburg v. Ohio(1969 , the Supreme Court established that speech advocating illegal conduct is protected under the First Amendment unless the speech is likely to incite “imminent lawless action.” Fox’s repeated assertions that the election was “stolen” did in fact incite people to besiege the Capitol, violently attack those attempting to protect members of Congress and call for the murder of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and the lynching of Vice President Mike Pence. Ben Smith, writing inThe New York Times, reminds us of how Fox’s campaign of misinformation did in fact incite “imminent lawless action” — “High profile Fox voices, with occasional exceptions, not onlyfedthe baseless belief that the election had been stolen, but theyhelped frameJan. 6 as a decisive day of reckoning, when their audience’s dreams of overturning the election could be realized.” It is remarkable to me how quickly, easily and absolutely Tessier-Lavigne and Rice erase the fact that the “speech” they are so passionately attached to protecting is speech that incited an attack against the democratic process and an assault on the peaceful transfer of power, one of the signal points of pride our country celebrates. Fox’s lies were relentlessly blasted out before, during andafterthe Insurrection, but as the comments quoted above indicate, for Tessier-Lavigne and Rice, Murdoch’s case is simply one of a point of view that has to be protected like any other one. When law professor Deborah Henslerexpressedconcern that Tessier-Lavigne’s statement seemed to indicate “that seemingly anyone, no matter their views, should rightfully be considered a candidate for a university institutional leadership appointment, in the interest of assuring freedom of expression,” Director Ricetoldher, “You have been a problem this entire time.” Now what sort of “speech” is so precious that Tessier-Lavigne and Rice wish to protect Murdoch’s “free speech” right to broadcast them? Here are someexamplesof the kind of speech that Murdoch admitted he could have stopped, but did not: Lou Dobbs: “How important do you believe are the concerns being expressed in a number of states about the ability of these Dominion Voting Systems machines not to be hacked?” Rudy Giuliani: “The machines can be hacked. There’s no question about that. Their machines can be hacked. But it’s far worse than that, Lou. Dominion is a company that is owned by another company called Smartmatic… It was formed really by three Venezuelans who were very close to the dictator Chavez of Venezuela and it was formed in order to fix elections.” Sidney Powell: “The money creating Dominion came out of Venezuela and Cuba… It is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence.” Jeanine Pirro: “Yes, and hopefully the Department of Justice, but who knows anymore.” As NPR points out, the Dominion lawsuit disclosed texts from each of these news anchors showing that they knew what they were saying were lies. Astonishingly, in their rush to protect Murdoch, why do Tessier-Lavigne and Rice not pause to consider the protection due to the victims of the violence Fox helped incite through its reckless and self-serving spreading of misinformation? Here is part of the testimony of US Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell: “My fellow officers and I were punched, pushed, kicked, shoved, sprayed with chemical irritants and even blinded with eye-damaging lasers by a violent mob who apparently saw us law enforcement officers, dedicated to ironically protecting them as U.S. citizens, as an impediment in their attempted insurrection,” Gonell said. In his opening statement, Gonell said that he could hear officers “screaming in agony” as the mob crushed them and that he heard specific threats on the lives of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the event to certify the presidential election in Biden’s favor. “For the first time, I was more afraid to work at the Capitol than during my entire Army deployment to Iraq,” he said. “In Iraq, we expected armed violence, because we were in a war zone. But nothing in my experience in the Army, or as a law enforcement officer, prepared me for what we confronted on Jan. 6.” The Guardianreportedthat members of security details were so terrorized that many said goodbye to their loved ones: The official said: “The members of the VP detail at this time were starting to fear for their own lives. There was a lot of yelling. There were a lot of very personal calls over the radio, so it was disturbing. I don’t like talking about it. “There were calls to say goodbye to family members, so on and so forth… for whatever reason it was on the ground, the VP detail thought this was about to get very ugly.” Such terrified and panicked messages were relayed from the Capitol around the time Trump tweeted to his supporters a now infamous 2:24 p.m. message in which he did nothing to calm the riot. It is beyond belief that anyone, much less the president of a university, would claim that what Rupert Murdoch did in facilitating Fox’s attack on the truth should not only be condoned, but even protected by, of all things, his “academic freedom.” Yes, Tessier-Lavigne called critics of such reckless and dangerous misinformation, members of his own faculty, “thought police” because we are supposedly infringing upon Murdoch’s “academic freedom,” and Rice repeated the same charge. I havemade clearmy feeling that “academic freedom” has been devastatingly cheapened and instrumentalized at Stanford, and this is exactly what Tessier-Lavigne and Rice are doing. As far as I know, Rupert Murdoch is not (yet a member of our faculty. Protecting the dissemination of misinformation under the umbrella of academic freedom is a tremendously dangerous move to make — if this were to be established as legitimate, it would exonerate anyone accused of any kind of research misconduct. Yet when faculty object to these violations of ethics we are accused of imposing “an orthodoxy.” Such an accusation is an affront to every decent person at Stanford University. Why are we so anxious to maintain our relationship with Rupert Murdoch, whose actions stand in direct opposition to Stanford’s supposed commitment to truthful information and to producing knowledge for the public good? Why should the public ever trust us if we harbor and protect Rupert Murdoch? What does this say about Stanford University? Since neither the University president nor the provost nor the director of the Hoover Institution, all addressees of ourfaculty letter, have answered the question we posed — why is Rupert Murdoch affiliated with Stanford? — we are free to draw our own conclusions. Two reasons stand out — money and connections. Put in that light, let there be no mistake, Stanford University and the Hoover Institution are accepting money derived from corporations that have made that money by, among other things, fueling the Insurrection with misinformation and pushing antisemitic hate. That the president of our University and the director of an institution premised on, among other things, the protection of democracy from authoritarianism, should collaborate, using such shabby pretenses and threadbare evasions, to protect the world’s largest purveyor of misinformation as he uses his vast media network to pollute public discourse and threaten the democracy of the United States, is an insult to intelligence and morally appalling. This episode may well go down in not only the history of US higher education, but even in the history of our country, as a dark stain. Tessier-Lavigne’s and Rice’s cynical, instrumental and illogical use of concepts and values we hold dear — free speech and academic freedom — points to a cancer deep in our leadership that seems to be metastasizing daily. And last but not least, their high-handed bullying of the faculty and personal vendettas against those who dare call out each and every one of these transgressions shows their utter contempt for those who use their free speech in ways that displease them. I was chastised by Director Rice for mentioning the Jeffrey Epstein case at Harvard. I did so because I wanted to remind us of what a university president can be. Here is how I ended my comments at the Faculty Senate meeting: On Sept. 13, 2019, Harvard President Lawrence Bacow issued astatementdissociating Harvard from Jeffrey Epstein. Even though the Epstein case is not perfectly similar to that of Rupert Murdoch and the Sacklers, one thing Bacow said strikes me as relevant today: “Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes were repulsive and reprehensible. I profoundly regret Harvard’s past association with him. Conduct such as his has no place in our society. We act today in recognition of that fact… Harvard is not perfect, but you have my commitment as president that we will always strive to be better.” At stake here is the question as to whether or not Stanford has the courage to, regardless of how some may characterize the action, declare that someone who knowingly allowed the spread of misinformation which presents massive public harm has “no place in our society.” On behalf of over one hundred members of the faculty of Stanford University, I ask again, what value does Rupert Murdoch bring to Stanford that overrides the damage he has brought to our country?"
rice_thresher_2023_52,"BySolomon Ni3/7/23 10:05pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. The Student Association in this past year has been disappointing to say the least; the discourse and lack of engagement I have seen reflects that disappointment. The Student Association’s reckoning has been a long time coming. The organization is in need of urgent reform in order to be more receptive to all the students it represents. The Student Association has taken up this savior complex speaking on behalf of marginalized groups on campus. Instead of elevating their voices, the Student Association has minimized what they are able to contribute. The Student Association is not the end-all be-all of advocacy at Rice University and beyond, let us be real about that. In the most ideal form of the organization, we give the most relevant voices the platform that the Student Association can provide, as well as the resources that come with the organization including funding and having access to representatives like those on University Standing Committees. A resolution is meaningless if those in charge are not willing to put in the work towards tangible solutions and I want to apologize, on behalf of the Student Association, to every person who has come to the Student Association seeking action on issues personal to them, to just receive the response “You can write a resolution!” with no action following it. You deserve better. As president, this is a priority to make sure we are following through on the resolutions that we pass and the priorities we set as a Student Association. I am agitated alongside everyone dissatisfied with how the organization runs and the expectations that it currently sets. Every meeting I have had, whether that is with the Executive Team or Senate, has made me increasingly uncomfortable. I have had members of the Executive Team talk openly with members of the Senate about my private life behind my back, making the environment I work in increasingly hostile. It has made it difficult to work in a space like that and undermines my effectiveness as an advocate. How the hell am I supposed to feel comfortable speaking up when in the back of my head I am paranoid about what members of the Senate know and don’t know about my personal life? This kind of behavior is unacceptable from any student organization, let alone the Student Association, and something I will not tolerate in the next Student Association. I have had consistent pushback on the transparency initiatives I have championed during this Student Association. Not having the adequate time and scope in the Senate to effectively lay out how Blanket Tax Organizations have utilized their funding has been a consistent frustration, because my prerogative, as treasurer of the Student Association, is to keep the student body informed of how their money is being spent. Pursuant to transparency to the student body, we are going to open up more of our internal processes to make it easier for the general public to understand how their student government runs and operates. Despite all the aspects the Student Association has fallen down on, I know the organization can bring about real change and be representative of the students it represents. I am proud of all the things I and the Blanket Tax Committee were able to accomplish. We were able to fulfill our goal of financial transparency this past year with publishing all of the Blanket Tax Committee’s minutes and decisions regarding Initiative Fund and mid-year audits. The Committee was able to effectively hold Blanket Tax Organizations accountable about their spending and passed reforms to that effect. We were able to work with the Rice Women’s Resource Center to secure funding for a supply of emergency contraceptives, going from office to office to have our questions answered about what distribution looks like and to make students feel as comfortable as possible. The RWRC was finally able to upgrade its office computer from 2007 with funding from the Blanket Tax Committee and the Student Association Initiative Fund. The Faculty Senate heard and passed the resolution I co-authored with Olivia Roark, the Jones Senator, designating Election Day 2024 as a non-instructional day. That work could not have been done without Vivian Zheng, the election judge for Rice’s election precinct, and the support of Dr. Caroline Quenemoen, RICEngaged, and the Center for Civic Leadership. As I come into my term as president of an organization that needs a significant overhaul, I am optimistic for what the next Student Association can do with the right goals in mind, with people that reflect the belly of experiences and backgrounds we find on our campus, and a lifting of the burden that our organization’s bureaucracy can be. My last ask to you, is you grant me and the next Executive Committee the opportunity to build up this organization to what it can and is supposed to be. Direct your energy, passion and resources to the causes and organizations personal to you and those around you. The next Student Association and I will do our best to be there to assist you and do all we can to support your voice and cause. The Student Association is dead, long live the Student Association! April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.

crimson_2023_119,"The tangy odor of cardamom and cinnamon drifts from the freshly brewed masala chai that aunties and uncles sip, dancing with the sugary aroma wafting from the children’s cotton-candy machine. At the entrance of our Ramadan Suhoor tent, I hear a chorus of familiar, gentle laughter and soft murmurs of conversation in the moonlight. As I whisper the words of the Quran and hear its soft sound grace my ears, a feeling of peace washes over me. Rejuvenated by this oasis of community, I am eager for another day of fasting. I forage for the rest of my family, covertly clutching my wand of cotton candy and savoring sparse samples of chai en route. Just as we become united and begin to say our “farewell salams,” we happily bump into old friends who pause our return home. This is how I remember spending my childhood Ramadans at the Islamic Center of Greater Cincinnati. Each year during Ramadan, the excitement of being together is palpable; with only 30 days available, each night is irreplaceable. Ramadan represents much more than merely the physical experiences of hunger or thirst that come with fasting from dawn to sunset. Abstaining from external pleasures of food and drink requires a degree of self-discipline, a kind of restraint which often compels me to refrain from forms of excess consumption. Ramadan encourages self-reflection, while being interspersed with communal experiences; the combination synthesizes the perfect playground for spiritual cultivation. The experience compels me to improve my character, patience, and contribution to the world around me, in ways simply not possible in the other eleven months of the year. Night by night, the chaotic yet cozy environment within my childhood Suhoor tent fused with tranquil, early morning Fajr and late night Taraweeh prayers to catalyze my yearning to come to the masjid — the Islamic place of worship — as often as possible. Only there, at the masjid, did I really ever feel my world slowing down and my own focus stabilizing amid the entropy of everyday life, promoting my desire to remain. Rooted in the lunar calendar, the month of Ramadan shifts earlier each year in relation to the Gregorian calendar. As a consequence of calendar misalignment, Ramadan, once an anchor of my summer breaks, has now creeped into term time. Now, long nights spent standing in Taraweeh are occasionally substituted for note-taking at my desk. And for many Muslim students across the world, this year’s Ramadan may be the first time that they practice away from their own family, friends, and communities from home. I’ll be honest: A pivotal factor in my college decision process rested upon how each campus community supported Muslims during Ramadan. It was important to me that my school environment would foster my ability to grow and improve in all aspects of my life, not just academics. Ramadan at Harvardhas enhanced my experience in unprecedented ways. With strong support and direction from full-time University Muslim Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid, and Harvard’s first female Muslim Chaplain Samia Omar, Harvard students and affiliates have access to an enriching and welcoming community. The joint effort of the Muslim Chaplaincy and the Office of the President have created an environment where Muslim students can experience Ramadan on-campus more comfortably with assured nightly programming. As a Muslim at Harvard, I am surrounded by ample resources, which I would not have without the advocacy and work of those who have come before me. Yet this is not the norm across higher education. Many simple marks of support, such as a designated Islamic prayer space, are still subjects of stagnant discussions being held at other universities across the country. It is imperative that other higher education institutions model similar institutional support to their Muslim students, staff, and faculty, both during and after Ramadan. Carefully designing resources and support for Ramadan necessitates months of full-time preparation — a feat that is best accomplished by dedicated staff rather than a small handful of self-organized students. Chaplains Omar and Abdur-Rashid have ensured that all Harvard affiliates can join together in community dinners and congregational prayers during every night of Ramadan. With their assistance, the number of participants in these events has increased to nearly 600 students in the past year alone. As I reflect on this past Ramadan, I cannot help but appreciate the palpable sense of excitement and energy on campus akin to my oasis of community at home. Building off ideation and excitement from last year, together, Muslim students haveorganized and planned activities this Ramadan. In collaboration with Associate Dean of Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro and the Dean of Students Office, we, the Harvard Islamic Society, have created Weekly Community Suhoors to teach all students about Ramadan. In addition, we are hosting a larger celebration for Eid al-Fitr, the Islamic Holiday that concludes this month of fasting. On a more personal level, students have brought Ramadan traditions from their homes to campus, whether that involves decorating iftar spaces with lights, giving Eid gifts to children, or creating fundraising initiatives campus-wide. Now nestled within the Student Organization Center at Hilles, a makeshift prayer room recalls those same, precious moments of laughter and conversation I shared years earlier at home. The adhan (call to prayer echoes through the room, and the community, bustling with people of all different ages, backgrounds, and studies, pauses to reflect and give thanks for the blessings of the day. As I look forward to these last few nights filled with prayer, reflection, and togetherness, I am grateful to have such a special and meaningful community here at Harvard. Hasan S. Quadri ’25 is a Neuroscience concentrator in Mather House and a Co-President of the Harvard Islamic Society."
crimson_2023_26,"Last week, Harvard Hillel and Harvard Chabad organized a vigil “to grieve together and to show support for Israel.” More than 1,000 members of the Harvard community, including the College dean and associate dean of students, attended. In the days after, snippets of speeches from the vigil werepublished in The Crimsonand shared on its social media. One speaker said, “These are the hardest days in the history of the Jewish people,” noting also rising antisemitism on campus. She also declared, “We have lived in exile too long. We will not be exiled again.” I do not pretend to speak to what it is like to be Jewish right now. I believe and sympathize with the discomfort and fear expressed at the vigil about antisemitism, and I have mourned the loss of Jewish life over these past two weeks. But statements like these are violent, violent lies. At the vigil, speakers suggested that antisemitism would not stop them from speaking out in support of Israel. For example, one speaker said, “There is hate swirling around on campus… But our unity transcends that hate. It does not silence us. It does not intimidate us. It does not stop us from gathering here in public together, hundreds strong.” I am relieved to know that they feel that way. Anti-Zionist students do not. In April 2022, The Crimson Editorial Board publisheda staff editorialin support of Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, a Palestinian-led organization and movement in support of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, styled after the South African anti-apartheid strategy. In the days following, our editors became the targets of an intense doxxing campaign, receiving misogynistic, racist, and antisemitic letters and messages from around the world. Names of Editorial editors were placed on online watchlists, where many remain to this day. And two weeks ago, after the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee publishedits statement, Harvard was again the site of a bone-chilling attack on free speech. Trailed by local and national news, the conservative organization Accuracy in Mediaparaded students’ names and facesaround Harvard Square. I watched as the truck broadcast the identities of two of my friends. What troubles me about the first speaker’s comments at the vigil, the ones still ringing in my mind, is this reality, a campus where anti-Zionism puts your name and face on a moving wanted poster and support of Israel puts your name and face in the New York Times. This reality reflects the enormous disconnect between what is happening on the ground in Gaza and what is reported on in the media. So we hear that it is Zionism — supported bythe commander in chiefof the most powerful military on earth — that is under siege. That it is Israelis who are in danger of exile, not the hundreds of thousands ofPalestinians who have fled their homes, many of whichno longer exist, in northern Gaza in the last two weeks. The events of the Oct. 7 attack were tragic:More than 1,400 Israeli civilianswere killed. There are no words to describe the pain so many are feeling. But when I hear statements like “these are the hardest days in the history of the Jewish people,” I am obliged to respond that they are not. History books are filled with antisemitism, from pogroms and ghettos to trains that were never meant to bring anyone back. These are the memories, the anguish, that hovered over the crowd at last Sunday’s vigil. But comparisons to the Holocaust carry power which haunts our campus and threatens lives in Gaza. Our cultural conception of the Holocaust makes it necessarily unique: It is the unrepeatable, incomparable crime. We still speak of the banality of its evil, the inhumanity of its contempt for human life. If Oct. 7 was like the Holocaust, then what becomes of Gazans? Monsters, devils, things unworthy of moral regard; their deaths become,in Gabriel Winant’s words, “famously, publicly worthless and undeserving of commemoration.” Slowly, we inch closer to an ideology that groups together millions of people — children, mostly — and names them the public enemy, says that “it is an entire nation out there that is responsible” for the violence of Oct. 7. Like this, any call for Palestinian statehood can be transmuted into a bloodthirsty growl, and the mere existence of Gaza, home to Hamas, those “human animals,” and the people supposedly responsible for their rise, becomes reason enough to fear the worst. Last Sunday, another speaker asked of Palestinian activists: “What are they calling for? Are they calling for the eradication of the State of Israel? Are they calling for the slaughter of the nine million Jews, Muslims, Christians, Bedouins, and Druze living in Israel? Are they calling for the killing of my family?” A quick jump from the specter of the Holocaust to the imagined threat of a second. There is a state in the world right now with plans to turn another into a “city of tents.” It wields the death of its citizens as a weaponwith which to kill othersand with it has killedat least 3,000. There are no signs its carnage will end. Multiple international observers have sounded the alarm of genocide. On the ground, at night, families lie awake in prayer, and if the sun rises they pray again, grateful to have seen another day. I only ask that we be honest. This state is Israel.

stanforddaily_2023_51,"In a recent article, a former provostlamentedthe loss in our university and society of “the ability to disagree, to dispute, to debate, without questioning our opponents’ fundamental dignity and humanity.” The cultivation of a space for respectful, rational debate is a noble goal and one that undoubtedly falls within the purview of a university. But within his argument, the former provost made a troubling claim, one that is unbecoming of someone who hasfilledsuch an important role for our institution: namely, the claim that “a university stands for nothing if not the free expression of viewpoints — true or false, supported or unsupported, agreeable or repugnant.” A university is a place for the creation, preservation and sharing of knowledge. False and unsupported arguments are antithetical to the pursuit of truth and knowledge with integrity, which should be expected of everyone within our community. The post-truth political climate we currently inhabit, where disinformation and alternative facts abound, has its roots in the proliferation of these false and unsupported arguments. The “community of scholars, who approach even the most agonizing events with compassion and understanding — and a determination to find a solution” must be firmly rooted in the reality-based community. It is neither respectful nor rational to entertain false and unsupported arguments. The story the former provost shared of his proudest day as a university leader is touching and holds important lessons for us, though perhaps not the ones that he highlighted. When the community came out in solidarity to protect fellow members from hateful speech and rhetoric, it wasn’t in order to disagree, dispute and debate with the Westboro Baptist Church. The false and unsupported ideology Westboro came to profess in itself denied the dignity and humanity of members of the campus community, which was countered by solidarity and affirmation of the humanity of our fellow community members. The happy resolution at the end of the story was not that Westboro Church members altered their viewpoint after rational engagement but that they chose to leave and not return to a place where false and unsupported arguments were not tolerated. That was only possible because “hundreds and hundreds” of community members responded, likely to the calls of dozens of dedicated organizers who made plans that the former provost neglected to credit. A key tenet of a university is academic freedom to pursue topics that run counter to mainstream thought. Questions about which lens to use in approaching a problem and which tools are most effective to address a particular question are opportunities for rational, respectful debate. A diversity of viewpoints often strengthens the resulting product by introducing new lines of questioning. But academic freedom does not allow for eschewing academic responsibility — arguments must be grounded in truth and supported by evidence. The former provost concludes with a well-made point: we should “not … look to the university to assure us that our side is right.” A university does not exist to teach people what to think, but how to think. I was fortunate enough to obtain a Ph.D. in my time working at Stanford, which means I have been trained in critical thinking and analysis. That is why I cannot stand for false and unsupported arguments, nor the supposition that it is the duty of the university to platform them.

crimson_2023_162,"I live in New York, so I go home relatively often — usually at least once a month over the course of the semester. And every time I do, I know I’ll be performing a specific activity. Every Sunday morning that I’m home, without fail, my nine-year-old sister bounds over and asks me to make her scrambled eggs. I always oblige, of course. And this isn’t just because she’s too cute to resist, although having a toothless nine-year-old tell you sweetly that you make the best eggs ever doesn’t hurt. Rather, every time I whisk a couple of eggs together, adding salt, pepper and the secret ingredient (garlic powder and cooking them slowly on the burner until they come together, I think about our relationship. Every college student with younger siblings knows the struggle of trying to keep in touch as lifelong roommates suddenly become estranged for the academic year. Amid the bustle of Harvard’s culture of never-ending problem sets, back-to-back lectures, and late-night club meetings, staying up to date on happenings at home hundreds of miles away can seem like a nearly impossible task. It’s hard enough to stay up to date with my two teenage siblings who have social and academic lives of their own. But at least teenagers, regardless of their flaws, usually have phones, not to mention social skills, making it easier than ever to bridge the gap. A quick text, a silly meme, or a brief video call can effortlessly transcend the physical distance and time constraints that Harvard life imposes. For those of us with very young siblings, however, the challenge multiplies. I am very close with my littlest siblings, and spend lots of time with them at home, going on day trips, playing games, and watching movies with them. But those things just don’t translate well virtually. My youngest sister, though she has an iPad with iMessage enabled, simply doesn’t know how to maintain an online conversation, not due to any fault of her own. Her idea of texting involves spamming me with several unicorn pictures and all of the different-colored hearts in the emoji library, and then proceeding to not send me anything else for days on end. Calls don’t tend to go any better. When we FaceTime and I attempt to strike up a conversation, it usually only lasts for a couple of minutes. I ask about school and what happened that weekend, and she then proceeds to lose interest in what essentially becomes an interrogative interview. There are always more exciting things going on in person than speaking with your sister who is several hundred miles away on a small screen. Of course, this is frustrating to me, and anyone else who feels like they essentially lose their youngest siblings for a couple of months when they leave for the semester. In the tapestry of college life, the significance of sibling relationships cannot be overstated. Siblings often stand as understated yet crucial pillars of support, offering a unique blend of shared history, unconditional love, and a reality check that only a familial bond can provide. Young siblings can also be utterly hilarious in a way only children can. My sister, for example, has a maniacal yet adorable laugh that can make everyone around her crack up too. Sometimes, in the thick of midterms, I just want to hear those peals of laughter, and knowing that likely I won’t until I go home again can be a bit depressing. There’s no good way to navigate relationships that just can’t reach their fullest potential until you spend time together in person, and that can sometimes lead me to fear that her childhood is passing me by while I am out of the house. When we are together, though, things slip into normalcy. Upon my return, my sister always greets me with a huge hug, but I don’t think that’s her truest expression of missing me. My nine-year-old sibling is almost absurdly picky, and would subsist on bread, chicken nuggets, hot dogs, and macaroni and cheese if she could, yet she loves when I cook for her. Maybe my eggs aren’t the best in the world, but they are a food that she loves — a show of nonverbal affection on her part. And every time I spray the small frying pan with oil and prepare to pour in the scramble, I silently think about how much I love her too. This ritual keeps me grounded and reminds me that no matter how far apart we are or for how long, my sister and I will always share a bond. I definitely haven’t mastered the delicate balance of long-distance sibling relationships, but I highly recommend to everyone reading this: Develop your own in-person custom with your siblings. It might not involve cooking, but I can attest that the right, simple action can rebuild connections in an instant. Find your scrambled eggs, and savor the garlic-flavored moments that keep your sibling relationships alive, even from afar. Leah R.

crimson_2023_71,"You might expect that students would be happy to embrace an extra school holiday. With this in mind, I had high hopes when, as a member of the Harvard Votes Challenges, Icirculated a petitionto make federal Election Day a University-wide holiday. I was disappointed. The students I encountered were far from eager to sign — my efforts were largely met with disinterest, and sometimes even with disdain. Maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised. The lackluster response I received calls attention to broader trends of youth disengagement from voting that demand urgent attention. Compared with other age groups, young people across the nation have lower rates of participation in many political activities, including voting. We cannot simply assume young people have declining interest in voting and move on — in fact, relative to older cohorts, young people are likelier to report barriers to voting, such as trouble with registration deadlines, difficulty accessing polling locations, and delayed receipt of absentee ballots. Voting is already confusing, and the proliferation of complicated voting laws across the nation only makes matters worse. This process is even harder if it’s your first time. Despite these institutional obstacles — indeed, because of them — we must remain committed to political participation. We must ensure young Americans can successfully and responsibly vote, and help our communities back home do the same. While young people face numerous barriers to voting, Harvard students possess a unique edge. We have access tovoting instructions and resource packagesthat campus civic engagement groups diligently compile, peers and faculty intimately familiar with barriers to voting and how to overcome them, and a wealth of academic resources that enable us to research each election with gusto. Given this advantage, we have fewer excuses not to vote. We must commit to checking our voter registration status, double-checking the voting policies of the states we plan to vote in, and securing absentee and mail-in ballots if we’re voting away from home. And when we do vote, we must know who and what we’re voting for. “Low-information voters” — voters who lack a robust understanding of the candidates or issues they’re voting for — represent a substantial portion of voters nationwide. That matters. The catchphrase “your vote is your voice” only holds true when your ballot truly represents what you want to say. Casting an uninformed ballot can reduce the change-making potential of your vote or, worse, skew political change in a direction you might find undesirable. Accordingly, students must rigorously research the ballot before we vote. Because this research can be time-consuming, it is critically important to proactively form a voting plan well ahead of Election Day.There exist numerouseasy-to-use resourcesto make this planning process less daunting and drastically more efficient. We must pay close attention not only to the glamorous national races, but also to local elections, many of which happen every year and can have a greater direct impact on our communities but face lower rates of voter turnout. Finally, eligible voters of the Harvard community must export these voting practices from the streets of Cambridge to our homes. Most people lack the wealth of civic resources on Harvard’s campus, especially individuals belonging to communities that have historically faced disenfranchisement. Sometimes it feels as though our political system is designed to prevent young people from engaging with it. Voter suppression and disengagement are structural issues that can’t be solved overnight. But we need not lose hope. There are millions of voting-eligible college students and young folks in this country. If we vote, and vote right, we hold immense amounts of power to elect candidates that truly represent us and, unflinchingly, hold elected officials accountable once in office. With dedication, we can make meaningful progress on the structural failures of the United States voting system and, in turn, the failures of government itself. We are the next generation of leaders, and that leadership must start now. By ceding to voting barriers, we risk extinguishing the sparks of civic engagement; by voting, we can fan them into political change. Layla L. Hijjawi ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Grays Hall and is an organizer with the Harvard Votes Challenge."
rice_thresher_2023_29,"ByThresher Editorial Board9/12/23 10:43pm Dean of Undergraduates Bridget Gorman and Chief Clemente Rodriguez of the Rice University Police Department unveiledPolicy 854, the university’s new regulations on micro-transportation, in a Sept. 7 email. The policy, among other things, prohibits the operation of scooters and bicycles inside and at the entrances of university buildings, in addition to requiring operators of these vehicles to yield to pedestrians at all times. The recent changes to the rules of the road are reasonable and important. Day after day, the signs calling on cyclists to dismount in front of Brochstein Pavilion go unnoticed; the many cars, scooters, bicycles and shuttles that share the road make for a congested frenzy on the Inner Loop at midday. Near-accidents are far too common on our campus. Other universities have recently taken more drastic measures to combat issues with micromobility devices. Yale University, for example, hasoutright bannedunapproved electric vehicles from university residential properties due to fire and safety hazards. Harvard University has proposed asimilar resolutionto Rice’s that prohibits students from riding micromobility devices on their sidewalks and walkways and bans them entirely from Harvard-owned or operated buildings. We do not want a total ban of e-scooters on campus, so we ask both administration and students to consider what they can do to make this new policy actually effective. Many of us students fear the theft of our bicycles, skateboards and scooters; although Rice can be perceived as a “bubble” sheltered from the rest of Houston, we are not immune from the issues that affect it. However, bringing these micromobility devices into classrooms and public building spaces is not a good solution. Rice needs to provide safe, accessible and abundant parking for micromobility devices. Rice has come a long way since the first foundations of our university were laid in the early 1900s, yet many of our narrow roads and buildings remain mostly unchanged. The unfortunate reality is that as more students matriculate every year, some bringing with them their many scooters and bicycles, Rice’s infrastructure has not kept pace. It is, however, unrealistic to assume that only by tearing down our curvy roads and grandiose halls may we solve this issue; that would be, in itself, an extreme plan. Rice needs to turn to simple and fair plans, and we students need to work with the administration in a conscientious way.

ubyssey_2023_7,"Oct. 20, 2023 Written byJosé Reyeros José Reyeros (he/him is a Mexican fifth-year student in Geography focusing on climate justice. His research has covered topics from fossil-free research to ocean conservation. He’s passionate about social good and is working on the Organize UBC campaign. The 2022/23 annual AMS Academic Experience Survey found that only11 per cent of students believethat UBC cares about their opinion on the cost of education. Ifannual tuition increasesweren t enough stress for students, UBC pays Work Learns at low and disproportionate rates,with most positions paying between $18 and $22 per hour. Many Work Learn employees — myself included — make just above minimum wage, and nearly all available positions earn less than a living wage, which is $24.08 per hour for Metro Vancouver, according toLiving Wage for Families BC. For many students, developing applied and employable skills in our area of study is important. That is also a luxury for many. Balancing our professional interests with a decent wage is tough. With only a limited number of Work Learn positions for over 70,000 undergraduate students, many students are forced to work off campus. On top of that, the federal government’spolicy allowing international students to work over 20 hours per weekoff campus is about to expire at the end of the year, making us rely even more on Work Learn positions. How can students afford to live and study in Vancouver like this? For many, being a Work Learn isn’t just about work experience or extra spending money — it’s a financial lifeline. These paycheques determine whether or not we can pay rent on time or afford groceries this month. For this reason, Work Learn jobs mean a lot more than your employer may know. I know this from my own experience. I hold a Work Learn position, but since these positions are limited to only 10 hours per week, I also work two additional jobs and am a full-time international student. I’m able-bodied and have found the capacity to work this much, but not getting enough sleep or time for myself is unsustainable. This situation also limits my access to scholarships, as finding ones I’m eligible for can be difficult when I have to trade my grades for employment across three jobs. What have I learned from this madness? My time and work are valuable, very valuable. Often as Work Learns in our first “office/lab job” we feel like we just had our professional “big break.” In a labor market based on experience, we truly rely on trust from an employer to get a chance to earn money beyond serving or washing dishes. But the truth is that students deserve decent wages regardless of their level of experience or field of work. To advocate for fair compensation and working safety means we must raise our voices and do it together. Student workers, like all Vancouver working residents, are facing an affordability crisis. We have seen studentsprotest for food insecurityorrefute tuition increases. Yet, asreflected in the AMS Academic Experience Survey, students continue to face financial hardship related to tuition and other expenses and food insecurity. That is why Work Learn employees need to act. Organize UBC is collecting Work Learn signatures to formally unionize Work Learn students with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE . The goal of the campaign is to add Work Learn students engaged in academic work (holding titles like Academic Assistant, Research Assistant or Project Assistant to the Teaching Assistant Union, CUPE 2278. Unions are democratically run, non-profit organizations that fight for better wages, paid sick leave, paid vacation, fair working conditions and improvements to your work, academic and life balance. Rather than having to advocate for ourselves individually, joining a union means we can stand together with a collective voice. If we collect 55 percent of signatures of Work Learns holding these types of positions, we will directly support the financial lifeline of fellow undergraduate students at UBC by unionizing our workforce. All student workers on UBC’s campus deserve to make a living wage. TeachingAssistants and Residence Advisors have both unionized and achieved this. Student workers have been joining together across different job titles and this value of uniting together is growing across the institution. Last spring and summer, thousands of Graduate Research Assistants and Academic Assistants signed union cards to join the Teaching Assistant union. If Work Learn students join too, then all students across campus engaged in academic work will be represented. As a fifth-year international student that wants younger students to not have it as hard, my message is that unionizing is simple. If you are a Work Learn student holding an academic job with a title like Research Assistant, Academic Assistant, or Project Assistant, all you need to do issign a cardon the Organize UBC website, share it with a friend, and let CUPE take it from there. You may not think you need it now, but as someone who’s been in different Work Learn positions, you will thank me next term. This is an opinion letter.

crimson_2023_135,"As many of us prepare to leave the hallowed halls of Harvard University, we’ll bring the skills we’ve learned into a world that needs them — badly. After all, the value of our education isn’t solely defined by the knowledge we gain, but by how we use it to better serve others. I hope more of us consider dedicating our talents and wisdom to a career in public service. This hope is shared by the very grounds of our campus. Located on Massachusetts Avenue, just across from the Harvard Bookstore, is a gate named after one Samuel Dexter, Class of 1890. Dexter, “a natural leader by all with whom he came in contact,” was president of his class at Harvard. When he graduated from this esteemed institution, he, like all of us, was expected to be a leader in the world. Tragically, his story ended just four years after his graduation, in 1894, when he died from cerebral spinal meningitis. Upon its erection in 1901, an inscription by then-Harvard president Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, was carved on the outside of Dexter Gate: “Enter to grow in wisdom.” Over the last 122 years, tens of thousands from this institution have uniquely embarked on that mission. I remember being called to this journey like it was yesterday. It was 2020, the height of the Zoom era, and I had just finished attending a remote community meeting. Three years earlier, in 2017, I had been elected to office on the Jersey City Board of Education. My election made me the youngest Muslim elected official in America. In January 2021, a year after I arrived at Harvard Law School, I was elected as the president of the Jersey City school board. My mandate was to reopen the schools as the pandemic came to an end. I thought I had a lot of wisdom by that point, but little did I know what awaited me beyond Dexter Gate. The next month, on the eve of my 24th birthday, I was diagnosed with stage four cancer. I can still remember the shock and fear that washed over me when I received the news. My whole world turned upside down in an instant. Suddenly, everything that I had planned for my life was in jeopardy, and I was overwhelmed by a sense of deep uncertainty about the future. I felt like I was in a daze, like I couldn’t process the information the doctor had just told me. I was scared, angry, and sad all at the same time, and I didn’t know how to cope with my emotions. I remember asking God, how could this happen to me? How could my passion for public service be so meaningless in the face of nature? I’m sure Samuel Dexter felt a similar sense of disbelief when he was diagnosed. But I got the chance that Dexter never did. In August 2021, I officially beat stage four cancer. A month later, in September 2021, our first month back on campus after the pandemic, I got to walk through Dexter Gate again. This time, my eyes were drawn to the inscription that greets your gaze as you leave the Yard: “Depart to better serve thy country and thy kind.” Our lives on this Earth are limited. Often, I hear those at Harvard suggest that we should worry about ourselves first and society later. But my journey has taught me to embody Harvard’s mission as soon as I leave its gates — to serve others by spreading the quest for veritas, the pursuit of the truth. Our time on Earth is too short to do otherwise. We have had a great privilege bestowed on us. We are fortunate to be reminded of it every time we enter the gates of Harvard University. Now I ask you, how will you depart? Will you use your wisdom to grow your personal fortunes and wealth? Or will you decide to contribute to the greater good and better serve thy country and thy kind? Hopefully, your growth in wisdom will make your decision as easy as mine. Mussab Ali is a third-year student at Harvard Law School."
ubyssey_2023_35,"March 10, 2023 Written byDaniel Anene-Akosa From Monday, March 5 to Friday, March 10, students will be voting for five new AMS executives, six SLFS Board directors, five senators-at-large and two student governors. Among all of these individuals vying for elected office, it’s easy to miss some of the referendum questions on the ballot this year. One of the four questions being posed to students includes the question Do you support and approve amending the AMS Bylaws in accordance with the changes presented as ‘Bylaw Changes 2023 - Indigenous Constituency and Miscellaneous Changes ?” OnMarch 1at the annual elections Indigenous forum, the AMS Indigenous Committee spoke in support of the referendum. The new constituency would allow for Indigenous students across campus to connect and collaborate and allow for more support for all of those groups within a constituency structure. This is a long overdue task for the AMS and one that I believe students should support unequivocally. That’s not the problem. This referendum item groups governance changes that should be made clear to students with the creation of the Indigenous Constituency. “Miscellaneous Changes” are included in this governance package, showing clear politicking within the AMS. Among items that aim to reduce the size of AMS Council, these changes will expand the influence of the AMS President’s Office. “Bylaw Changes 2023” will give the AMS president the opportunity to liaise with constituencies and manage the vice-presidents, according toThe Ubyssey. The changes also add the word “manage” to the bylaw which then allows AMS presidents to “assist, advise, and manage the Vice-Presidents in the duties of their offices.” This blatantly ignores the principles of democracy and responsible governance, and the ability of students to choose the direction of the AMS. Every elections season, we hear from candidates on the direction they plan to take their respective office in if they are elected. We cast our votes based on whose platform we believe is most beneficial for our student society, and we expect AMS Council to hold our executives accountable to their campaign promises by way of their executive goals. These governance changes give the AMS president oversight that students do not elect them for. According to this year’sGuide to Elections, the president is “responsible for ensuring everything at the AMS is running smoothly,” while being the key AMS spokesperson for students. Presidents are not elected to institute their external advocacy policy or to personally and unilaterally manage our student funds. That is the role of the vice-presidents. This bylaw change would grant the president control of all aspects of the executive team. This calls into question why we have individual elections for vice-presidents in the first place, if the president can ultimately control each portfolio. It’s undemocratic and contradictory to the AMS’s supposed devotion to proper student representation and advocacy. Students should be given the opportunity to vote on large-scale changes to the AMS — especially changes to the role of executives — individually from other referendum items. The wording of the referendum question as “miscellaneous changes” and “bylaw changes” ignores the significant structural changes this referendum will bring, which shows a lack of transparency toward constituents. I would like to reiterate the creation of an Indigenous Constituency is a great step forward for the AMS and UBC-at-large, and furthering collective goals of Indigenous representation and reconciliation. The issue here lies separately from discussion of the possibility of an Indigenous Constituency. The sole problem with this referendum is with its “miscellaneous changes,” which are not miscellaneous in any sense. The AMS’s hiding of important code and bylaw changes behind matters of reconciliation is unacceptable. The aforementioned bylaw change is one I feel all students should be made aware of. We elect these students and we, at the very least, should be afforded transparency in how our student society is managed.

wildcat_arizona_2023_13,"When men are fans of sports teams, they can dress up, paint their faces and be upset that their team lost. When women are fans of music artists, they are ridiculed for dressing up for concerts, staying up for new releases and being emotional when they go to shows. This double standard is alarming and ridiculous. When football playoffs were going on prior to the Super Bowl, men were getting absurdly upset at their teams, and some even went as far asbreakingtheir TVs. A woman would never be able to be that hysterical because they would be met with scoffs and rolled eyes. Men are allowed to be obsessed with their favorite things, while women are met with teasing. Most sports fans are male;48%of men are avid fans, while a mere 19% of females are avid fans. At the same time, only 13% of males are not interested in sports, and 34% of women are not as well. More men like sports, but when women express their liking, they face pushback. Women listen to more Billboard Hot 100 artists, which are mainly pop artists. About4 out of 5women are interested in musicians such as BTS and P!nk according toCloud Cover Music demographic survey. Bella Klein, a UA sophomore, said, “There’s a certain stigma for girls who enjoy mainstream, popular artists as if people don’t believe that they can genuinely enjoy those artists.” Women are listening to more popular music than men but cannot do it without having to defend their reasons for listening. There are different words used to describe fans, some of which are crazy, obsessive and devoted. I have never seen a man described as “crazy” or “obsessive,” I’ve only seen women described with those negative connotations. Men can paint their whole bodies in their teams’ colors, but women cannot watch every Austin Butler movie without being mocked. I am a Taylor Swift fan and had some of her posters in my room. During the early parts of the pandemic, while my high school classes were online, some boys in my class pointed out my posters and laughed about them in the comments. The boys in my class had many posters, and people could see memorabilia in their Zoom cameras. Nobody said a word about what was in their background. It is annoying that I could not show my room without being made fun of. I had to dial back my love for a musician in order to not to be teased. If women are fans of teams or sports in general, they are asked to name every player. If they fail, they are called “fake fans.” Women aren’t allowed to like anything without being shamed. If they like sports, they have to know everything about it. If they like certain music artists, they are poked fun at for enjoying “girly” things. Women cannot win. I think people who are fans of sports or pop culture should only be called fans regardless of gender. The things that make a person happy should not be looked down upon but be looked at as another thing that makes them, them.

crimson_2023_88,"I believe one of the greatest inventions of all time is the Internet. Online, I can access a plethora of information at my fingertips — something unimaginable just a few decades ago. But too often, I stumble across a groundbreaking tidbit of information and see an unwelcome message: $29.99 to finish reading this academic article. Really? Another paywall? Paywalls hide information behind a monetary barrier, either fully blocking content or offering limited access, perhaps by revealing only a paper’s abstract. Many require subscription to their service, subscriptions that are oftentimes insurmountably expensive for access to only one journal on one topic. Since larger journals also produce niche publications that require separate subscriptions, access to all information from just one publisher can cost thousands of dollars. As a student in a public high school that could not afford subscriptions to such services, paywalls made doing research and learning from primary sources extremely difficult. I was limited in what I could access, and as a result, I often felt my work to be incomplete. My experience has been remarkably different since coming to college, because Harvard subscribes to a host of journals and publishers. In 2012, the University reported spending $3.75 million on journal subscriptions alone to accommodate its wide assortment of fields of study. This fee is difficult for many universities to front — some, including Harvard, have canceled subscriptions to journals due to rising costs. Lack of access to journals can have a significant negative impact on research. Publishing research is designed as a way to communicate findings and techniques; it is cumulative, as new research builds off older findings, and knowing which methods work can save valuable time and resources. Take the incandescent lightbulb, for example, which, although often attributed to Thomas Edison, was built off the work of many scientists. In today’s climate, perhaps Edison would not have been able to pioneer his model, because a paywall might prevent him from accessing the designs of his contemporaries. For students, reading publications is one of the best ways to learn about new fields of study; it helped spark my interest in biology. But without access to reputable information from scholarly sources, it becomes difficult to explore interests and pursue research of our own. While working to publish research from my science fair project in high school, I needed to read many articles about my topic, but found it a challenge to access more than a quick summary because I simply could not afford to pay for every article individually. Utilizing cited sources within the primary literature and review articles allowed me to finish my research, but I had to spend many frustrating hours digging through sources to find the necessary information. Rather than spending time writing, and polishing my analysis, paywalls forced me to use that time looking for loopholes on the Internet. Despite its unavailability, many students require scholarly information to succeed in their studies. As a result, many use sites like Sci-Hub, through which moderators download articles to which they have paid access and make them available for free. The use of such sites is often illegal in the United States, as downloading articles from them can break copyright laws. This is disadvantageous for everyone involved, including researchers who lose their intellectual property, and is not an adequate solution to the paywall problem. One way researchers and journals are beginning to combat paywalls is through publishing data and research open access — that is, free of charge and accessible to everyone. Several journals have made their whole catalog open access. Other journals have given researchers the option to make their articles open access if the authors themselves pay an additional sum of money on top of other publishing fees. This model, which relies on researchers’ existing funding, can be even more profitable for journals than a standard subscription model, as they can charge unrestrictedly high amounts of money to publish open access. But the same problem arises — since many research institutions struggle to find funding, this system incentivizes researchers to publish behind a paywall. The reluctance publishing companies feel about removing paywalls is understandable, but there are many alternatives for earning money on digital platforms. Relying on donations, like Wikipedia, or including advertisements are possible solutions. Although it may be inconvenient for users to view advertisements in the middle of an article, this could allow research to be shared more widely. Journals could alternatively employ student discounts, offer free subscriptions for educational institutions, or allow free viewing of articles for a limited time to help promote opportunities to learn. We are no longer limited by location and access to books or libraries to learn new things. Rather than treating publicly shared research as a commodity, journals should consider removing paywalls to make education more equitable. Everybody deserves the opportunity to engage with the cutting edge of human ingenuity, and removing paywalls is an important first step in that direction.

rice_thresher_2023_7,"ByThresher Editorial Board11/28/23 10:36pm Rice’s 111-year history is marked by lots of positive impact — and plenty of harmful actions. William Marsh Rice, the university’s founder and namesake, was a slave owner, and from the school’s establishment as a free institution for only white students toKu Klux Klan meetingsoccurring on Rice property, the connections to segregation and racial injustice cannot be denied. In 2020, the Down With Willy movement kicked off in the wake of racial justice protests around the country, calling on Rice to remove the statue of William Marsh Rice from the academic quad. The Founder’s Memorial statue has now been lifted off its pedestal, but the majority of current students had not yet matriculated when Rice made that decision in January 2022. Further, the removal of the statue is not the end to addressing the legacy of slavery at this university. As members of the Rice community, knowing the context behind this is crucial for the fight to make the university a more equitable place for underserved groups. Rice culture has shifted dramatically in just the few years since the Down With Willy movement started. The majority of current students have only known “Beer Bike Week” and “The Pub at Rice,” not “Willy Week” and “Willy’s Pub.” The statue that used to sit high in the center of the academic quad will now be in a flower bed by the Welcome Center, next to information about William Marsh Rice’s role as a slave owner. Regardless of how much the founder’s image is removed from the university, there is value in continuing to research and acknowledge the history of our institution and using it to move forward. The legacy of slavery and segregation cannot be separated from the founding and development of the university, so we all must continue to reckon with it as the institution grows in its second century. The Task Force on Slavery, Segregation and Racial Injustice, commissioned in 2019, recently released theirfinal reportwhich details in-depth research on Rice’s establishment as a white-only institution and its journey to integration, as well as Black students’ experiences throughout. The report also discusses how Rice’s actions impacted Houston, making the university’s history all the more important to understanding racial injustice in Texas as a whole.Archivesof the Thresher relay what was happening within the Rice community, from its early years to integration to the Down With Willy movement. Black students hadmore demandsin 2020 than just removing the statue, such as admitting more Black students and creating a space akin to the Multicultural Center for Black students to congregate. The Task Force issued similar recommendations in their final report, including having 80 tenure or tenure-track Black faculty within 10 years. Through learning about the history of Black community members’ activism and listening to their experiences, we can support future changes that address the mistreatment of Black students, staff and faculty throughout the university’s history. Though Rice continues to improve, we cannot become complacent and stop learning about our history. To be active in the Rice community and work to improve it, we need to understand the long legacy that continues to be felt today. Only then can we make the university more equitable and better suited to the needs of all current and future students.

crimson_2023_67,"I have served as a voting member of the Harvard College Honor Council, the body tasked with upholding the College’s community standards of academic integrity. In my time on the Council, I heard dozens of cases. When students — my classmates, peers, and friends — appear before the council, they are distraught. For most, it is the worst day of their college careers. For some, it is the worst day of their lives. They often cry. It is because I have seen first-hand how heart-wrenching these decisions can be, and still think them necessary, that I call on University President Claudine Gay to resign for her numerous and serious violations of academic ethics. Let’s compare the treatment of Harvard undergraduates suspected of plagiarism with that of their president. A plurality of the Honor Council’s investigations concern plagiarism. In the 2021-22 school year, the last year for which data is publicly available,43 percent of cases involved plagiarismor misuse of sources. Omitting quotation marks, citing sources incompletely, or not citing sources at all constitutes plagiarism according to Harvard’s definitions. In my experience, when students omit quotation marks and citations, as President Gay did, the sanction is usually one term of probation — a permanent mark on a student’s record. A student on probation is no longer considered in good standing, disqualifying them from opportunities like fellowships and study-abroad programs. Good standing is also required to receive a degree. What is striking about the allegations of plagiarism against President Gay is that the improprieties are routine and pervasive. She is accused of plagiarism in her dissertation and at least two of her 11 journal articles. Two sentences from the acknowledgement section of her dissertation even seem to have been copied from another work. According to the Honor Council’s procedures, the response to a violation depends on the “seriousness of the infraction” and “extenuating circumstances, including the extent to which a student has had similar trouble before.” In other words, while a single lifted paragraph could be blamed on a lapse in judgment, a pattern is more concerning. In my experience, when a student is found responsible for multiple separate Honor Code violations, they are generally required to withdraw — i.e., suspended — from the College for two semesters. Since the Council was established in 2015, roughly 16 percent of students who have appeared before us have been required to withdraw. It is a serious thing for the Council to render this judgment, and I have never taken any such vote lightly. Voting to suspend a peer with whom I might share a dorm, club, or class is not easy. We have even voted to suspend seniors just about to graduate. But strict sanctions are necessary to demonstrate that our community values academic integrity. Cheating on exams is not okay. Plagiarism is not okay. It may be true that the plagiarism allegations against President Gay fall short of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ interim policy on research misconduct. She may not have “intentionally, knowingly, and recklessly” tried to represent the work of her doctoral advisor and others as her own. And there is no evidence that any of her arguments posited as original contributions were plagiarized. But President Gay’s pattern of mistakes is serious, and the Harvard Corporation should not minimize these allegations of plagiarism,as it has readily done. In a Dec. 12 University-wide letter, the Corporation described the alleged plagiarism as “a few instances of inadequate citation.” The letter lauded President Gay for “proactively” correcting her articles by inserting citations and quotation marks. By definition, Gay’s corrections were not proactive but reactive — she only made them after she was caught. And that the Corporation considers her corrections an adequate response is not fair to undergraduates, who cannot simply submit corrections to avoid penalties. When my peers are found responsible for multiple instances of inadequate citation, they are often suspended for an academic year. When the president of their university is found responsible for the same types of infractions, the fellows of the Corporation “unanimously stand in support of” her. There is one standard for me and my peers and another, much lower standard for our University’s president. The Corporation should resolve the double standard by demanding her resignation.

stanforddaily_2023_10,"On the question of whether Stanford’s graduate workers should unionize, the Graduate Student Council’s (GSC answer is a resounding yes. We make this recommendation after careful consideration and out of a deep sense of responsibility as your elected leaders. Stanford’s graduate workers must unionize in order to resolve our pressing and worsening needs. Stanford controls not only our academic progress, but also our wages, rent and even food supply. Yet, our minimum assistantship salaries havefailed to keep pace with skyrocketing inflationfor the last three years, while the cost of on-campus housing continues to rise. Our health insurance does not cover basic needs, such as dental and vision care. All the while, we may be researching and teaching in highly variable work conditions, with some students expected to work upwards of 60 hours per week for their assistantships. We work second (or third jobs beyond our academic responsibilities to cover the living costs in one of the most expensive areas in the United States. We forgo essential mental health, dental and vision care. We line up at aSecond Harvest food pantryto get our groceries once a month — taking resources from our neighboring communities because Stanford,one of the wealthiest universities in the world, refuses to pay us a living wage. We wonder how we will ever pay for emergencies, should they arise, given the strain on the University’s emergency grant resources. Graduate students deserve better from Stanford, and we all know it. Despite years of GSC efforts to raise alarms about this crisis, it simply is not enough to push Stanford’s leaders to support us. We collected our own data, and when that data was not considered “rigorous” enough to change the University’s approaches,we collaborated with Institutional Research and Decision Supportto craft a survey that would produce the rigorous data the Stanford administration said they needed. Stanford’s leaders kept us from having a seat at the decision-making table, set our minimum assistantship salaries without taking into consideration the data they promised they would use, and, to add further insult, informed us of their decision nearlytwo days afterannouncing it to the rest of the University. We took avote of no confidence— the first in the GSC’s history and the strongest symbol of broken trust available to us. When that was not enough to sway University leadership, wecreated a petitionthat again emphasized our demands, which 2,500+ Stanford students signed. Yet, we were rebuffed again and told by Provost Drell that “we the University are not in a position to move forward with the other initiatives.” Some of these “initiatives” do not even cost Stanford money, such as publicly reporting the data sources and calculations used to set our minimum assistantship salaries from 2018 forward — a basic ask for transparency that is alegal requirementat many of our public peer institutions. We exhausted every advocacy avenue, but it was not — and will never be — enough. Now, University leaders tell us that we should be happy with a3-day, temporary returnof the previously daily, permanent Shopping Express — a mere fraction of our initial asks and woefully insufficient to address our dire needs. In recent weeks, some individual departments and schools have taken admirable steps towards addressing this affordability crisis. The School of Medicine, School of Humanities & Sciences and Graduate School of Education decided to raise their own minimum assistantship salaries by 7% this year (above the University-set raise of 4.9% , and the Schools of Medicine and Humanities & Sciencesdisbursed one-time $1,000 stipendsto their graduate workers. We are appreciative of these schools’ leaders for this allyship with their graduate students. However, relying on Herculean efforts from student leaders or the goodwill of individual schools is not a sustainable solution to ensure that our needs will be met in perpetuity or equitably across all graduate workers. Every year, a new GSC steps into office and is forced to start anew, building relationships and engaging in good faith advocacy, only to be told by University leaders that it is “too late to make changes” time and time again. What, then, is a sustainable solution? We need an organization that will endure beyond any student government’s tenure and has institutional memory of past negotiations with University leaders. We need an organization that does not rely on under-resourced, overstretched student labor and has the bandwidth to advocate for us consistently on multiple fronts (clickhereto learn more about Stanford’s union platform andhereto learn more about union “wins” at our peer institutions . We need an organization that extends beyond Stanford and has the collective bargaining power to fight with and for us. We need a union.

crimson_2023_123,"The singsong hum of prayers was dominated by one person’s voice — a voice carrying a Yiddish accent of a bygone era, a voice steeped in the Old World Jewish communities known as shtetls, a voice that exuded the type of confidence only found among the old and wise. That man’s name was Morton Friedman, and he had been proudly reciting those prayers for decades, even after he saw his community nearly entirely wiped off the map of Europe during the Holocaust. I was lucky because I got to know him between prayer services a decade ago. “Yankel,” he would say, using the Yiddish version of my name, “how are you doing today?” In the conversations that followed, he would share stories about surviving the concentration camps and seeking refuge aboard the S.S. Exodus along with thousands of other Jewish Holocaust survivors. But as survivors of the Holocaust grow older and die, fewer and fewer people have the opportunity to learn about its atrocities firsthand. Because of this, public knowledge about the Holocaust is in serious jeopardy. Less than half of respondents inone recent surveyof Americans knew how many Jews were killed in the Holocaust, or that Adolf Hitler came to power through a democratic process. Holocaust denial is also on the rise:An estimated 19 percentof Twitter content on the topic distorts the truth or denies the events outright. In the Netherlands — the former home of Anne Frank, whose diary chronicles her persecution during the Holocaust —a recent survey foundthat 23 percent of adults under age 40 believe the Holocaust is a myth or exaggerated. Perhaps as a result of these distorted retellings of history, antisemitic incidents in the U.S.are surging. Last month, the FBI reported a20 percent increasein violent crimes targeting Jews from 2020 to 2021. According to the American Jewish Committee’s 2021 annual survey, nearly 40 percent of American Jews have reported changing their behavior in fear of being victimized, a trend that makes sensegiven the multiplerecentmass shootings targetingthe Jewish community. Meanwhile, over the past few years, several public figures have used language easily construed as antisemitic. From former PresidentDonald J. Trump’s comments arguingthat Jews who vote against him are disloyal tostatements from Democratic Representative Ilhan A. Omarthat both Republicans and Democrats criticized for playing into antisemitic tropes (although she did later apologize , politicians on both sides of the aisle have played a part in cultivating an antisemitic climate. Other celebrities contribute as well — like Kanye West, who notoriouslytweeted that he would“death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,” even while claiming that he “actually can’t be Anti Semitic.” Antisemitism is not the only kind of hate that increases when we forget the Holocaust. A primary lesson of the Holocaust was how easily society can slip into an authoritarian and genocidal state. Before the Nazis took over, Germany was a promising democratic republic and a center of arts and culture. Remembering the Holocaust can help us recognize history repeating itself — including, scarily, themass genocidesthat are still taking place today. Growing up, the Holocaust was just a fact of my life, and thinking about it was like thinking about my parents childhood — nothing in my community would make sense without it. The oft-repeated mantra “never forget” seemed so inane that it bordered on meaningless. After all, how could one possibly forget such an atrocity? Today, that rallying cry no longer appears so trivial. In 2020, Morton Friedman died. He can no longer share his story with others. Slowly, recollection of the Holocaust is passing from eyewitness stories to the domain of history textbooks. The challenge our generation faces is establishing how we can “never forget” when those with lived memory are nowhere to be found. One truth is obvious: In order to never forget, we must always remember. On an intellectual level, remembering is easy — a history textbook is a sufficient resource for those seeking to understand exactly what transpired. But sometimes it takes more extreme measures to truly comprehend the Holocaust. The concentration camps where Jews were forced to do hard labor, and then brutally murdered and cremated in mass ovens, are kept in their original condition so that visitors can be impressed by the stunning cruelty of the Nazi regime. Film and literature produced by victims, as well, can provide a visceral perspective. And this potential for a visceral connection was why we — Harvard Hillel — brought a replica of a Nazi cattle car into Harvard Yard. It is true that films and artifacts are disturbing — but that is precisely the point. The memory of atrocity fades when it is reduced to descriptions or images. Sometimes it takes seeing an actual object, or watching a vivid account, to experience the revulsion that the memory of the Holocaust should evoke. While taking a class about the Holocaust is educational, seeing a cattle car where Jews were packed like sardines, and transported for days without food or water and only a bucket for excrement, is unforgettable. Touring a concentration camp where Jews were brutally suffocated in specially built gas chambers is very different from reading the number six million. Those of us who have heard survivors share their experiences aren’t likely to forget the terrors of the Holocaust soon. But our societal memory is flickering, and we are feeling its result. Antisemitism, and hate writ large, can only be combated properly when we remember the past. I will miss talking with Morton Friedman, but I will carry his memories with me. I hope you will too.

crimson_2023_30,"The phrase “Social Studies” means many things to many people. For some, it evokes images of fourth graders memorizing capitals and singing the fifty states in order. At Harvard, however, Social Studies refers to one of the College’s most popular concentrations. What has led so many students to take Social Studies 10, the concentration’s sophomore tutorial with a reading list that spans Hobbes to Foucault? What do people really learn in this popular, but ill-defined program? Founded in 1960, Social Studies was created to address two major concerns: first, that students were overspecialized, and second, that students were unable to focus on concrete social problems without being “academically coerced into a conventional departamental approach.” To this end, six “founding fathers” from a variety of social science disciplines came together to create a concentration that permitted,according to the Social Studies website, “the crossing of departmental lines and the study of major social problems from a variety of disciplinary perspectives.” Today, Social Studies is an interdisciplinary concentration that attempts to teach students how to study and solve social issues, allowing them to draw from offerings in History, Economics, Government, Sociology, and Anthropology to build a “focus field” around their distinct academic interests. In that sense, Social Studies mirrors the mission of many other departments. It differs, though, in not assuming that any one method has a monopoly on truth; rather, it allows the problem at hand to dictate the method. So has it succeeded? Do students graduate from the program with a solid answer to a social issue of their choice, along with methods to solve more of these issues down the road? Not exactly — but maybe that’s by design. In my conversations with students in the concentration, and from my own personal experience as a Social Studies concentrator, I’ve come away with a picture of a program that teaches very few concrete lessons, but is lauded by its students as an intellectually formative experience. What’s their takeaway? More than any method or skill, Social Studies teaches students to embrace uncertainty. The crux of a Social Studies education lies in the concentration’s seminar-style tutorials, usually taken in students’ second and third years at the College. Of these, the sophomore tutorial, Social Studies 10, is the most foundational, serving as a starting point for all concentrators. The original conception of the sophomore tutorial, according to Social Studies co-founder Barrington Moore in an April 1962 report on the then-nascent concentration, was that it should “introduce students to the main issues that still agitate social scientists and enable them to see how first-class minds have struggled over them.” Many current students laud this historical survey. Saswato Ray ’25, a Social Studies concentrator, told me in an interview that Social Studies “gives you a good general overview of how exactly we started thinking.” “Anyone who takes 10b can kind of understand how our perspectives on thinking about this stuff — like the political, social, economic stuff — it changed so much since Hobbes and Rousseau,” Ray said. Yet this examination has its downsides: The effect of surveying the efforts of economists, political scientists, sociologists, and other theorists to solve social problems is often a recognition that their work rarely, if ever, produces satisfying answers. Since the program’s conception, students and professors alike have arrived at this realization. One student from 1962 explained that the tutorial “had read a series of inadequate single factor explanations of war that convinced him any single factor explanation would not do.” Sasha C. Hitachi-Kizziah ’25, a Social Studies concentrator, echoed this sentiment. “You write an essay, and you’re kind of unsatisfied with the answer,” she told me. “Do I fully believe this? Do I fully understand it?” The first generation of Social Studies students ran into the same problem many of us concentrators run into now: In Moore’s words from 1962, an “exaggerated expectation about what to hope for in the way of a grand synthesis” gives way to “a form of mild paralysis — or at least great uncertainty about what to do next — when the synthesis fails to put in an appearance.” As they progress through Social Studies 10, though, students become more comfortable with the uncertainty. They embrace it, asking themselves what other assumptions they may have taken for granted. At first, Moore recounted in his 1962 report, some students “were mildly disturbed at first by what struck them as a permissive uncertainty about the character of their task” — but then embraced it. Students today have arrived at the same conclusion. “The stuff that I’ve mostly learned from 10b was to question things in different ways, from different angles — tear stuff apart, basically, and question what we hold as normative,” Ray told me. What this spirit of questioning leads to is not merely an unbridled skepticism of all previous attempts to explain social phenomena. Instead, the product is a deeper examination of social science research as a whole. In the first couple of years of Social Studies, tutorial leader Joseph Berliner arrived at the same conclusion. “The students have now, I think, come to accept as a fit subject of discussion not the explanation of a particular social phenomenon but the question of how one can identify a satisfactory explanation of anything when he sees one,” he wrote in a letter to Economics professor and Social Studies co-founder Alexander Gerschenkron in the early 1960s. The result is a critical examination into the practice of inquiry. Instead of simply asking what we can know, Social Studies also asks how we can know. The faculty leading Social Studies’ development as a concentration have applied the same spirit of uncertainty to the construction of the curriculum. Over the past sixty-three years, faculty have debated the proper way to teach students how to solve social problems. Throughout this whole process, they’ve accepted the fact that they will never arrive at an acceptable answer. Instead, they embrace a process of ongoing experimentation. Brandon Terry, one of the current course heads of Social Studies 10b, told me that the sophomore tutorial “takes its mission from the broader charge of the program.” The authors on the syllabus, he said, “are not only a model of this kind of inquiry, they’re not only an introduction into the ongoing conversation of how to study particular problems, but they also teach you how to ask the really big questions.” So what authors can best teach students how to ask the big questions? That’s still not quite clear. After half a century of trial and error, the syllabus — and the course staff responsible for curating it — have failed to settle on a concrete answer. Throughout the first couple of decades of Social Studies’s existence, instructors’ main worry was methodological, of how to best organize thinkers and introduce students to the “spirit of questioning.” “It is suggested that a pairing of Hume and Mill would not violate chronology seriously and would give added ‘bite’ to the methodological problems of the social sciences,” reads one 1962 proposed revision of the course. Another suggested syllabus change from 1968 aimed to ensure that the course “proceed to abstract methodological issues only after the students have completed important studies which raise and illustrate the issues.” By the turn of the 21st century, though, as students became comfortable with the program’s critical mission, suggested reforms aimed to challenge what exactly was critiqued. Social Studies concentratorslamented the concentrationof white, European, and heterosexual authors. Faculty members likewise began to recognize the importance of issues like gender and race that had not been subjected to the same critical study as other topics. “It’s really about the kinds of questions and theoretical approaches that are possible if you include certain voices,” Terry told me. “It is a dead end trying to theorize the origins of modern race-making and the possible range of responses from oppressed people to the racial order if you don’t read DuBois.” “To me it’s about expanding the range of problems to fit the things that are most pressing in our time,” he added later. My point here is not to focus attention solely on a specific critique of the syllabus. It’s to make clear the constant changes the program undergoes. Over more than sixty years, the Committee has not yet arrived at an answer to how to best teach students how to know. We shouldn’t be surprised at that, though. Within each tutorial, students would be hard pressed to find a concrete answer to why countries democratize, or how people conceive of their identities. The same critical and permissively uncertain approach used in the classroom is reflected in the program’s development as a whole. In this vein, Terry said that he thinks of the Social Studies 10 syllabus as “an ongoing experimentation,” echoing the words of Social Studies co-founder Alexander Gerschenkron calling the program “an exciting experiment.” Gerschenkron continued that “it should thrive on innovation, and it would be a pity if the feeling should prevail that the period of experimentation was all over.” That is Social Studies’ most important lesson, one that can be integrated into all parts of life. What the program has embraced, both on a micro and macro level, is uncertainty, an eager acceptance of the limits of our ability to answer questions, and a motivation to continue asking those questions all the same. On a personal level, that’s a difficult reality to acknowledge. We crave certainty, and even if we’ve reluctantly accepted some issues, like the existence of God, as existing outside the limits of our reason, our Enlightenment-era internal drive pushes us to search for simple answers to the complexity of the world around us. It seems that there’s only two options: Find the truth, or live by blindly holding on to whatever grounding we can find. The futility of the first often leads us to accept the second. Yet there’s a third option: Find motivation in the process itself. Retain hope in the possibility that, even if you as an individual may never write an essay you’re fully content with, your role within a larger context is a productive one. Few people, if any, have ever found the truth. That doesn’t mean that it’s all been for naught, though. Ask questions, embrace uncertainty, and continue the struggle. Manuel A.

stanforddaily_2023_47,"Over the past nine weeks, students showing solidarity with Palestine have been incessantly accused of supporting terrorism — I have received comments, emails and social media messages claiming that I support beheading babies.

Despite what many Western media sources, including our student newspapers, The Daily and the Review, will have you believe, the ongoing violence in Gaza is not the fault of Islamist terrorists. Not only is this rhetoric one-sided and simplistic, it is also misused and abused by oppressive regimes around the world. This rhetoric of terrorism is used bythe Chinese Communist Partyagainst the Uyghur resistance,the Indian governmentagainst the Kashmiri resistance and theMyanmar militaryagainst the Rohingya resistance. In all these cases, a state with a powerful military purports to be “fighting terrorism” as an excuse to brutally attack and oppress indigenous Muslim populations in their homelands. Israel uses the same strategy to ethnically cleanse Palestine by claiming to fight Hamas while bombarding all of Gaza.In 2001, George W. Bush paved the way for the weaponization of this rhetoric when he declared his “Global War on Terror” to justify invadingIraqandAfghanistan. This is nothing more than a ploy drawing on theIslamophobic trope that Muslims are violent and barbaric. According to theUnited Nations Refugee Agency, there is no internationally accepted definition of terrorism; however, “as a minimum, terrorism involves the intimidation or coercion of populations or governments through the threat or perpetration of violence, causing death, serious injury or the taking of hostages.” Terrorism is terrorism, whether it’s committed by a state or a stateless people. Terrorism is terrorism whether the U.S. government acknowledges it or not. Israel is most deserving of the “terrorist” title in this conflict, especially given their lack of mitigating circumstances: they are not being occupied or blockaded, they have international support and they have advanced military technology capable ofprecise targeting. Why, then, are Muslim students asked to condemn Hamas, while advocates for Israel are not asked to condemn the IDF? What is Israel’s excuse forlevelingresidential buildings? Or targetingrefugee campsandschoolswith airstrikes? Orcutting offelectricity, food, medicine and fuel to all of Gaza as collective punishment? Ordroppingwhite phosphorus on civilians? Or ordering over a million Gazans to evacuate beforebombingan evacuation route? Or murderingover 170 civiliansin theWest Bank, which is not governed by Hamas, while the world is distracted bygrave risk of genocidein Gaza? There is no excuse.The Israeli government is a terrorist organization. Many on campus claim that supporting Palestinian resistance makes me a terrorist sympathizer. But then what does that make those who justify Israel’s crimes against humanity by saying, “Hamas is holding human shields” and “Israel has a right to defend itself”? Was every one of the14,000Palestiniansslaughteredso far a human shield? The strongest military in the Middle East had tobutcher 4,000 kidsanddisplace 1.5 million civiliansto defend itself? If there was a rumor Hamas was hiding inside an Israeli hospital, would that justify blowing up the hospital? How about an Israeli daycare center? Those who misuse the rhetoric of terrorism center the conversation around Hamas, butthe cause of this crisis is not Hamas.Palestinians have been decryingviolenceby Zionist militant groups long beforeHamasexisted. And, even aside from Hamas,anyone whohas everfought backagainst Israelwasdesignatedaterrorist. You do not need to support Hamasto recognize this hypocrisy. Nor do you have to be Muslim or Arab.ManyJewsandformerZionistshave blamed Israeliapartheidfor the recent violence becausethey understand where our focus should be. To those who criticize us for not condemning Hamas: We Muslims are tired of being spoken down to. We’re tired of moral grandstanding from Western people. We’re tired of condemning groups we’re not affiliated with. Those who arrogantly demand condemnations from Muslims shouldfirst condemn the Israeli government. Then, and only then, will you have earned the moral capital to demand condemnations from me. As Americans, ourtax dollarsfund military aid to Israel, not Hamas. Stanford partners with Israeli companies complicit in the occupation, not with Hamas. Our administration condemned Hamas intheir letter to the communitybut said absolutely nothing about Israel’s atrocities. Atruckwas seen andphotographedby Muslim students on campus with the following message written on it in Arabic: “Warning: Stay away 100 meters or you will be shot at.” Palestinian and Muslim students on campus have received threatening phone calls from strangers and alumni, been doxxed,defamed, regularly harassed (even by a professor andassaulted. Many pro-Palestinians on campus don’t publicly comment because they fear these consequences. Anti-Zionist speech has always beenstifledin this country. All of this is why I choose to focus on Israel and not Hamas. I condemn theracistethnostateof Israel, and I condemn anyone who asks me to condemn Hamas without first condemning Israel. As a Muslim, it is part of my faith to oppose the killing of innocent civilians. Any harm to innocent Israeli or Palestinian people is undoubtedly horrible and should not be condoned. My heart goes out to all the affected families who lost loved ones and are hurting on both sides. To truly honor the lives of the victims and prevent this from ever happening again,we must stop the terrorist group directly responsible: the Israeli government. This conflict did not start on Oct. 7.Palestinianshavebeengettingslaughteredanddisplacedfor75years. Israel’s government cannot slowly eradicate the Palestinian population and not expect a violent response. The international community cannot continue to support Israel or remain silent and not expect a violent response.The recent violence is the direct result of Israel’s occupation of Palestine. Killing civilians is not justified. But under theseconditions, armed resistance against the Israeli military and policeis justified. On Oct. 7, Palestinians and their allies were not celebrating the death of Israeli civilians; we were celebrating Palestiniansbreaking out of their prisonandattacking military posts. I support armed resistance as Palestinians struggle to end Israeli terror, while simultaneously opposing deliberate harm to innocent civilians. There are many historical cases of civilians being killed by an oppressed group that is using armed resistance to overcome their oppressor. We look back at these today and understand that we must focus on the root cause of the oppression. For example,Nelson Mandela’sparamilitary wingof the African National Congress, which was designated a terrorist organization by South Africa, the U.S. and the U.K., conducted several bombings that killed police officers and civilians. Yet when we talk about South African apartheid, we start and end the discussion with the injustice of apartheid. The same is true for the AlgerianNational Liberation Front’s attacks against the brutal French colonial government,slave revoltsagainst American plantation owners andNative American attacksagainst European colonizers. This does not mean those civilian lives don’t matter — quite the opposite.It means their blood is on the hands of the colonizing, occupying and terrorizing force. It’s important to not get stuck in an echo chamber. We hear pro-Israeli perspectives every day on CNN, Fox, MSNBC and other Western news outlets. Weseean abundance offalse propagandaspreadbyZionistsinmainstreammediatostoke fearagainst Palestinians and Muslims. This is not a new phenomenon. In the 1990s, George H.W.

In 2001, the “weapons of mass destruction” lie was used to invade Iraq again.Fear-mongeringallowsgovernmentstomanufacture consentand act on entire populations with impunity. I encourage readers tobe critical. Check sources. Demand explicit evidence. Keep in mind that Israel has along historyof lying about itscrimes. The massacresin Gaza, on the other hand, areundeniable. Palestinians do not need to lie becausethe reality is far worse than is even imaginable. As the great Malcolm X said, “If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people being oppressed, and loving the people doing the oppressing.” Many students like myself are happy to engage in respectful and productive dialogue. Straw-manning our position as a defense of terrorism or antisemitism is intellectually dishonest and unconducive to progress. Those willing to support the children of Gaza canhelp attheselinks.

crimson_2023_174,"Breaking News: This Just In! Straight men in 2023 are no longer satisfied with the simple comfort of being surrounded by “the boys.” They yearn for the presence of a female partner but lack the emotional availability to maintain a long, healthy relationship — i.e. the ability to be kind for longer than three weeks. But rejoice, my fellow wounded doves of love: The long-awaited canon event of male self-actualization may finally be upon us. Coined initially as the “sassy man apocalypse,” this seemingly global wave of male self-actualization has been anticipated and longed for by feminists for generations. With the exception of Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, and Hozier, men have never widely experienced the divinity of vulnerability in romantic relationships. Whether through means of exploitation, barter, and trade, or the traditional value of the nuclear family, most societies through recorded history have cemented through words and actions the notion that women must be subservient to men. But that has all seemingly come to a stop. With the rise of the emboldened woman and the popularity of phrases like “I am Kenough,” men have been encouraged to recognize their emotions and have finally — by the looks of it — realized that their existence on this earth extends more than just the prowess of their physical capabilities. For instance, the growing prevalence of female household breadwinners has undermined the traditional pressure on men to be the provider and protector of their homes. Instead of putting their feelings aside and “being a man” in order to provide for their families, more men are finding time to process and understand the feelings that their fathers and forefathers cast to the wayside. The end result is what we see today: a “Sassy Mandemic.” The feelings garnered by uncovering what women have realized since the tender age of 12 have come to define the average experiences of a young man in his late teens and early 20s. Videos showcasing this phenomenon have even gone as far as quoting common realizations that women understand very early on in life: “What if I am not better than everyone else and I really am just some guy?” Men are beginning to understand their cosmic insignificance — or in layman’s terms, that they’re not “him.” But despite the humor inherent in the self-inflicted implosion of a hyper-masculine society, this is no laughing matter: The sad reality is that men have always been lonely, even if this truth is only beginning to be recognized by broader society. Historically, masculinity has often been linked to stoicism and emotional suppression, discouraging men from expressing vulnerabilities. By dismantling past generational burdens through recognizing and vocalizing their own feelings of isolation, men are bringing to light a reality that has long been detrimental to both sexes: Under the patriarchy, everyone is lonely. It is now time that men face the music that fell upon deaf ears for the past millennia. Women are just as every bit worth respecting as “the boys” you know and cherish. We as women are not owed to you, and our time and love demand respect and boundaries. We now live in a society where fostering a family is not required, and the approval of a man is no longer the primary goal of a woman’s life. We as women were not sent here to coddle your wounded egos. As men come to rear the consequences of the very society they built to dominate those deemed inferior, the revelation that many of them feel like mere cogs in a machine has finally made its way into commonplace conversation. With a society so predicated on the idea of leadership and strength, it makes sense that the center of power can only be occupied by a sole positioner, or at most a small circle. And as many men grapple with their randomness in this built society, hence follows the predictable existential crisis. But fear not, young men of society! All we as women ask is that you treat us as equal and as people worthy of respect the same as men. After reviewing that last line actually, I might’ve asked for too much, because I know how new all this is to y’all. But for a more streamlined answer to your question of “when will she pick me,” I say three words: “Pride and Prejudice.” Kelisha M.

crimson_2023_103,"Last Wednesday at around noon, my mom texted me. “Are you in class?” “No, why?” Immediately, my phone rang. My mind sifted through the countless snippets of bad news I could possibly hear when I picked up the phone call. I still wasn’t ready. “There’s been a shooting at East.” My heart sank. It wasn’t a hoax this time. Not a“swatting” call. Not a kid with a BB gun. The unthinkable had happened in my former high school — a place that I still see as home. It happened to a communitystill mourning the death of a classmate, Luis Garcia, who was shot just a block away from school last month. I scrambled to text my closest friends. For the first time in years, old group chats resurfaced. Within hours, “East High School” was a top 10 trending topic on Twitter in the United States. According to officials, a student enlisted in a personalized “safety plan” for daily pat-downs had pulled a gun and shot two deans. The presence of paramedics at the school for an unrelated medical emergency may have saved a dean’s life. Ultimately, the shooting ended with one death — the shooter — whom law enforcement says died by apparent suicide far away from school. At this point, it feels like there’s only so much one can say about this epidemic plaguing our country. We knowthe statistics. We know thatfirearms are the leading cause of death for American children and teens. A recent Crimson staff editorial aptly wrote that “We are the Generation of Mass Shootings.” So, instead, I’ll direct this to East High School students, current and former — to my peers. And in that vein, to all students who have feared for their lives within the confines of their school. The power and spirit that you hold in the heart of Denver is indomitable. I remember marching down Colfax Avenue to the state Capitol with hundreds of classmates in March of 2018 to demand more gun control after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High. I remember when our legislators met us at the steps and listened and I remember our teachers cheering us on. I have never felt prouder to be an East Angel than at that moment. Last month, when Luis was shot, you swiftly came together and fundraised more than $200,000 for his family. You wielded your power with other schools by walking out of class and to the Capitol, filling the chambers with your presence and your voices, calling for change. You lobbied. You made the news. You demanded more from leaders that have failed us for far too long. And last Friday, the day after Dean Sinclair and Dean Mason were shot, after you once again hid in classrooms, texted loved ones, and were forced to fear for your life,you marched right back, like East Angels do. I would expect no less. This past week, news of our school graced theNew York Times. CNN and Fox News picked up the story, too. People who have never stepped foot in Denver, let alone walked the halls of East, will read the news, judge, generalize, and form every opinion imaginable about our school. Don’t listen to them. Media and politicians will take these recent tragedies and frame them to fit their narrative. “This is why we need more gun control.” “This is a mental health issue, not a gun issue.” “This wouldn’t have happened if teachers were armed.” “There should have been police in the school.” “This is why you should vote for me for Denver mayor.” Don’t let the voices of the adults, God forbid the politicians and pundits, drown yours out. Keep organizing. Be a pain in the ass at the Capitol. Attend school board meetings. Speak at them. Write about what you want to see change within the walls of our high school, because nobody knows it better than you do. Build a culture that encourages the next students after you to do the same. But please, please, allow yourselves time and space to mourn. Care for each other, for your teachers, and for your administrators. Let the warmth of the community wrap its arms around you in love, support, and solidarity. It will only make you stronger. In four years or less, high school will be but a patchwork of memories for all of you. It is now for me. From spirited pep rallies, to meeting at the “E” before lunch, to marching down Colfax Avenue, these experiences shaped who I am today. I can’t even begin to imagine how the last few months have shaped you. Whatever you choose to do next in your life, I urge you: Remember the East Angel spirit. Bring it with you and spread it to the communities within which you find yourselves. Don’t stop wielding your voice and your power, and don’t stop caring for each other. We are Angels forever. Dedicated to Luis Garcia, Eric Sinclair, and Jerald Mason. Matthew E. Nekritz ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Cabot House and a graduate of East High School."
crimson_2023_1,"Few airlines receive as much negative media attention as Spirit. From the countlesscomedic TikToksrecording violent turbulences, to social mediatravel influencersrecommending the airline due primarily to its cheap prices, Spirit’s practices are the center of popular discourse. Despite the somewhat condescending looks I get from classmates every time the conversation of traveling back and forth to campus comes up, I proudly fly Spirit Airlines. As you book your own plane tickets — for home, school, or anywhere else your travels take you — you should consider joining me on the infamous, low-cost airline. In some sense, Spirit’s bad reputation is not without merit. The airline is rightly criticized for its misleading fee system, which shows you a low price — called a “bare fare” — but has a substantial catch: The price you see frequently includes only a small personal item and the flight ticket. Whereasmost major airlinespermit both a carry-on and a personal item for free, Spirit charges for each piece of luggage beyond the singular personal item, with higher fees for each additional bag. The hidden fees don’t stay at the gate, though. Spirit Airlines offersno complimentarysnacks for flights, and selecting your seat can cost youup to $200, according to their website. It’s even as if the website is designed to confuse people by complicating the process of declining any of these extra services: For example, users must click “continue without seats” to move forward with the complimentary random seat option. Beyond its online confusion tactics, Spirit’s seats are also uncomfortable, to say the least. They can’t recline, canlack padding, and reportedly havefewer inchesof leg space than other airlines. Even when you fork overas much as $250, all you get is a measly six inches of extra legroom, leaving you with the option of spending lots of money on a still-uncomfortable seat. Spirit is far from perfect — in fact, it might not even be good. But Spirit is what I have. As a homesick, broke college student willing to take any opportunity to leave the Harvard bubble, choosing the wallet-friendly flight is my only choice. Choosing Spirit has never been about flying in luxury — with reclinable seats, access to premium entertainment, and complimentary nuts — and we shouldn t judge it in those terms. Instead, it means valuing the destination more than the journey. It is about spending a few hours in an uncomfortable seat for the sake of spending time with friends and family. And once you arrive, you can spend those extra dollar bills at your destination — together. The stigmatization of choosing Spirit reflects just how lost our priorities are. Harvard students are too keen to criticize individuals for making unfashionable choices without considering the context that leads to them or how well they contribute to achieving their ultimate goals. Many low-income students are forced by financial necessity to choose between comfort and an airline like Spirit. When it’s time to decide between temporary comfort, such as that of choosing to fly in a higher class or on a better airline, or making a more frugal decision that the privileged take for granted, low-income students are wired to select the latter option. At Harvard, we have fallen too deeply into aculture of criticizing, in which weunknowingly make commentsthat further foment class divisions and alienate the unprivileged. While it may seem harmless, we are slowly drifting away from the essential kindness, compassion, and gratitude that keep our communities together. I grew up in a household that understands the value of temporary sacrifice for a fruitful future. It is the cornerstone of our philosophy as immigrants, built on the memory of leaving behind the comfort of one home for the better life offered by another. It has been the cornerstone for my success as a student, the spirit that pulls me through long nights of studying. And, notwithstanding those awful, awful seats, it gives me the strength to choose Spirit. I can sacrifice a few hours of comfort for the family members who sacrificed their lives back at home for my well-being. I don’t usually mind the snarky, admittedly funny comments about Spirit. But before you make the next one, aim your judgement at the airline — for failing to provide snacks, baggage, and comfort to its passengers — and reserve your kindness for your peers who are excited to reach their destination, unfazed by the bumpy but affordable ride.

stanforddaily_2023_30,"Who is against a committee on academic freedom? Probably no one. But after we get past the platitudes, it’s time to get real. The question that I wanted addressed in last Thursday’sdiscussion at the Faculty Senate— whose academic freedom seems to come first? — never got a hearing. Instead, I was told that this committee would be fair and impartial and that I should “trust the process.” These words are nearly always uttered by people who are the most protected by “the process,” and they are uttered to those most poorly served by the process. This essay explains the three reasons why I could not “trust the process” and thus why I voted against the motion to establish this committee. First, at the start of the Senate meeting I asked President Tessier-Lavigne about a document that has been circulating for months in the media and on the Internet. It’s called the “Stanford Academic Freedom Declaration.” I asked him if he had authorized the use of the Stanford name. He said he had not, and that when he pointed this out to the people who had circulated the “Declaration” for signatures using the Stanford name, they removed the word “Stanford.” I replied, “So they violated Administrative Guide 1.5.4, Ownership and Use of Stanford Trademarks and Images; they let their fraudulent document misrepresenting Stanford circulate for months on national media; and it was only after I contacted you that they stopped doing so? And that’s it?” This is in stark contrast to the reaction of the Senate when the Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative sparked concern because of its supposed harm to the Stanford name, and its creators werecalled to the floor of the Senateto atone for their sins in what can only be described as an inquisitorial tribunal — these people had been found guilty in advance of unspecified charges. The fact that two professors from the Graduate School of Business and a fellow of the Hoover Institute (the same three individuals who created the closed conference on Academic Freedom in November had perpetrated this fraud in the name of “academic freedom,” duplicitously using Stanford’s name, raised not a single eyebrow at the Senate. No concerns were expressed, no suggestion the miscreants appear before the Senate, not even a demand for an apology, despite the fact the actual authors of the document were in clear violation of University policy. That’s why I don’t trust the process. It is biased. The second reason I distrust the process—four of the people whointroduced the original motionhad signed and circulated the “StanfordAcademic Freedom Declaration.” As I dug into its prose, I found some things that concerned me. Much of the content of the “Declaration” derives from theManhattan Institute, one of the main sources Gov. RonDeSantis is drawing onin his massive attack on the academic freedom of all public educators in the state of Florida. The Declaration asserts: “employment, promotion, and funding are … subject to … political litmus tests …seeking to impose a social agenda such as specific views ofsocial justice or DEI principles;” and that “university leaders … oversee and expand politicized bureaucracies that …enforce ideological conformity in hiring and promotionmy emphasis .” I told the Senate — “I am concerned that once this committee is formed, it might be asked to investigate a very specific set of issues, programs and individuals. That would presumably include the new Race Institute, since the founding proposal for the RI is to do ‘racial justice’ work; the IDEAL program, which will likely be seen as giving preference in hiring based on racial identity and ‘ideological conformity’; and perhaps the School of Sustainability, given that John Cochrane — whose signature is the very first on the Declaration — hasclaimedin print that this School is engaged in ‘woke’ social justice work.” I went on to say: “It would help address these concerns if we could add this amendment: ‘Whereas the Senate supports and applauds programs to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in the exchange of ideas at Stanford…’” This amendment was promptly shot down — I should trust the process. But then Professor Larry Diamond actuallyspokethe truth that I had been trying to flush out all day, “I think there are many people that have some concerns about some specific DEI programs, one of whichis what triggered this entire conversationemphasis added .” That is to say, the entire convening of this Academic Freedom Committee is predicated on the hoopla over the Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative, and a fear of diversity initiatives which might force people to use different language (which the EHLI emphatically does not . The fact that the Senate effectively erased that history is the second reason I don’t trust the process. It is biased. The presenters of the original motion were and are using “Academic Freedom” as a Trojan horse to “investigate” diversity initiatives. No other supposed violation of academic freedom has triggered a Faculty Senate discussion, and that includes the violation of my own academic freedom, which brings me to my final reason for not trusting the process. In 2017, I was the subject of a nationalcampaign of harassment. I received so many violent and credible death threats from across the country that Stanford offered me police protection. During that whole ugly process, no one who originally proposed the committee on academic freedom said anything, even though a bipartisan group of Stanford law professors wrote anopinion piecesaying: “We are concerned that the article that sparked the attacks advocates for the resignation of a professor based on his constitutionally protected speech regarding issues of public concern.” Indeed, several years later, the Policy and Planning Board Subcommittee on Campus Climatereportedthe existence on campus of a chapter of Turning Point USA, home of the infamous “Professor Watchlist.” The Watchlist asks students and professors to “report” liberal professors and instructors, whose names and pictures are then placed on a national database. While it mostly targets liberal and progressive professors, in the past several years it has started to target climate scientists, epidemiologists and those who argue that the 2020 elections were fair. When we raised concerns about Turning Point USA at Stanford, one of the sponsors of the Academic Freedom Committeequestionedthe need for the Senate action we proposed: “Free speech protects minorities. Speech sic protects a minority opinion. It protects people of color. It protects diversity.” But let one faint possibility that some in-house diversity initiative might affect the academic freedom of this particular set of people, and this “triggers” action to create this committee — because apparently the existing protections are good enough for women and minorities, but they are not good enough for any other groups. In fact, “free speech” did not protect Hakeem Jefferson, a Black untenured professor, when he wasplaced on the Professor Watchlist— hate mail and harassment did not cease; “free speech” did not protect Emily Wilder, a Jewish Stanford undergraduate, who wasfiredfrom her job for exercising her free speech rights; and it did not protect me when I was subject to that virulent hate campaign. So, again, whose academic freedom actually counts? I don’t trust a process that ignores these real harms when they fall upon one group of people and then with alacrity and near unanimity creates a Senate committee solely on the basis of hypothetical harms which might possibly fall upon another group of people — people that the members of the Senate apparently identify and empathize with. After the Senate meeting, which left most everyone feeling very warm and content, I went to have dinner at a nearby restaurant. Two colleagues passed by and one of them said to me, “Hey man, I saw you at the meeting. At the end you seemed to go into deep Zen meditation.” I didn’t know it was so apparent. Yes, it’s true. I tuned out because once the liberal feel-good train starts rolling, the destination is pretty clear. I doubt I will go to any of the meetings which will discuss academic freedom at Stanford — it’s clear that my opinion is in the extreme minority and unlikely to have any effect whatsoever, besides just ruffling feathers and using up important time. So during those meetings, I will do my research and teaching and be with people I trust, because they have proven themselves to be trustworthy."
wildcat_arizona_2023_8,"Bereavementis demanding and burdensome, especially if you’re not dealing with it well. Being in college, there are so many other things to agonize over, like balancing classes and social life. If you toss grief into the mix, students are more prone to mental issues likeinsomniaandPTSD, and most don’t seek mental health services. In fact, only44%of college counselors report having given grief counseling in the past year. While other students are partying and having fun, it is hard for those struggling with grief to reflect on the death. Grades can drop, and people can isolate themselves from friends and family. College can be distracting in an unhealthy way, but it can also keep students busy from thinking about their deceased loved one. It’s hard for people to talk about losing someone they love, but it’s a necessary activity to help them move on. Whether it’s talking to friends, family, or a trained professional – talking about the loved one’s death can be a healthy way to cope. Speaking to a trained therapist canhelppeople cope by using their strengths to amplify their ability to manage. Expressing your feelings insupport groupsfor bereavement helps you to cope by talking to others who are going through a similar experience. There are also many other healthy coping methods,likejournaling and crying.Writingin a journal or just your notes app can reduce anxiety, create awareness and encourage opening up.Cryingreduces pain, detoxifies your body and improves your mood. Also, taking care of your body and mind, like meditating and eating regularly, can improve your situation. While coping with talking, crying and writing, many people choose to cope with drinking and drug use. Alcohol and drugs, like weed, are easily accessible and can help your mind take a break andcancause feelings of relief. However, using these methods can lead to addiction. These substances can only offer temporary relief; people need to find healthier alternatives to live a healthier life. My grandma passed away in early August, a week before school started. It was totally unexpected, and it nearly killed me. She was my best friend and confidant but lived 1,500 miles away, so I called her every Sunday. Seven months later, I am coping better and using healthier coping mechanisms. I write in a journal whenever I feel unhappy and let myself cry if needed. Grief isn’t linear, you can find peace for years, but one moment can cause you to go off the deep end. Be kind to yourself when this happens. Grief is a sorrowful part of life, but we must grow. Almost everyone has experienced grief before, so finding someone to talk to about it is easier than you think.

crimson_2023_47,"Six weeks ago, three days after Israel declared war on Hamas,a billboard truckequipped with blinding LED screens circled around Harvard Square, flashing the names and faces of our classmates beneath the headline “Harvard’s Leading Antisemites.” This truck was one of the first noticeable displays of what has become a month-long harassment campaign against outspoken pro-Palestinian Harvard students. In its recent staff editorial titled “Defending Speech When Speaking Is Hard,” The Crimson’s Editorial Board criticizes Harvard for insufficiently protecting doxxed students and lambasts the “weak-willed waffling” of University leaders, all of which has sowed greater division during this period of friction and distrust. And yet, as The Crimson’s Editorial Board — of which I am a member — scrutinized the University, we neglected to direct this critical lens to ourselves. Indeed, yesterday’s staff editorial was the first time the Editorial Board weighed in on the campus controversies surrounding the Israel-Hamas war since its onset. During our uncharacteristic hiatus, tensions at Harvard have worsened in tandem with the war; the Yard was closed to the public due to cautions over student safety, a pro-Palestinian proctor wasindefinitely relievedof his duties with opaque justification, and a group of pro-Palestinian Jewish students and allies staged a24-hour sit-inat University Hall to pressure Harvard to call for a ceasefire, among other demands. These are but a few examples of what has devolved into one of the most politically charged moments of our university’s memory — an intense series of compounding events that the Editorial Board refused to discuss for over a month. That silence was a mistake. The Crimson Editorial Board should have condemned the harassment of our classmates sooner. Instead, we waited and waited, choosing only now to fulfill our duty to opine in response to significant campus events. While the Opinion section has runmultipleideologically opposedopinion piecessince the start of the war, this is no call for praise. Publishing a diverse array of op-eds is the bare minimum of a credible newspaper; to do otherwise would raise obvious concerns of bias and censorship. Op-eds, by definition, reflect the views of individuals, not the Board as a whole. Until this week, it appears that we have hidden behind individual writers to deflect our responsibility to produce a collective stance. I want to believe that student journalists join the Editorial Board because we understand the importance of an institutional voice. We meet tri-weekly and talk at each other, sometimes for 90-plus minutes, because we believe that our voices, in unison, have the power to effect change. At the very least, I hope we care that each published editorial updates the 150-year-old written record of who we are and what we stand for. But there is no record of what we thought when the doxxing truck first appeared on Oct. 11. Or on Oct. 14, whenmore than 1,000 people assembledin the Yard to protest the impending ground invasion of Gaza. Or on Oct. 30, when Adam Guillette, president of the organization that operated the doxxing truck, called members of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee “cockroaches” on national television. Or on Nov. 9, when University President Claudine Gay blanketlycondemned a political chantfor Palestinian liberation without acknowledging the full historical complexities behind it. Journalism depreciates in value each day that it is tardy. Our inexcusably late arrival, absent of due explanation, suddenly bursts forth in a sanctimonious ruling. Our words — yes, even strong words — are not gospel. Nothing stated in our most recent staff editorial is novel or inventive. It contains little insight we could not have delivered six weeks ago, apart from fresh examples of our divided community. And, in spite of its high-mindedness, our editorial pales in comparison to what our peers have already done. Since the war began, Harvard students and faculty havestaged die-ins, curatedmoving public art installations, hostedtouching vigils, and mobilized against injustice every single day. These actions, exemplary of the swift and persistent courage of our peers, are worthy beyond their value as anecdotes for The Crimson Editorial Board to belatedly hyperlink. We can tout ourselves as intellectual, clear headed journalists, but when it was time to undertake the full responsibility of any publication worth its salt — which is not only to speak when it is hard but to do so with punctuality — we failed. And more than that, we abdicated the most important duty of a student newspaper: to serve our peers. The Crimson Editorial Board should never perch quietly above the issues that impact our community. When our campus suffers, we must speak. And if we delay this duty — a grave error at this crucial time — we must explain why. That is the least we owe to our readership and to our peers. So fault endures, still, in our refusal to admit we were wrong. I won’t hesitate to do so. Jasmine M. Green ’24, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Lowell House."
stanforddaily_2023_9,"Our generation has witnessed countless paradigm shifts. In each, community dialogue has been at the heart. From demanding acceptance of same-sex couples at prom to marching with Fridays for Future, we have seen firsthand how change can be achieved through shared conversations around common values. Last May, we formed theCoalition for a True School of Sustainabilityto challenge Stanford’s acceptance of research funding from fossil fuel companies for industrial affiliate programs in the newly-formed Doerr School of Sustainability. Our concerns were heard by Dean Majumdar, who promised to solicit student feedback through a listening tour. In the fall, wecalled on the Deanto include town-hall style events in the listening tour, in addition to smaller, department-specific sessions. This request was not met, and as a result, many community members outside the Doerr School who had direct or indirect involvement through cross-campus collaborations were not included in these listening tour sessions. We believe such a siloed process is detrimental to the collaborative community discussion needed on an issue as impactful as fossil-fuel funding for research. However, the listening tourdidlead to the formation of a Committee on Funding for Energy Research and Education (CFERE , which expands the conversation with stakeholders university-wide: a commendable step taken by Stanford. CFERE hasannounced opportunitiesto submit comments and request small-group meetings. However, we remain concerned that the committee and the school’s leadership have not been sufficiently open in their proceedings, thus hindering true and inclusive dialogue. The current approach funnels conversation through controlled channels, rather than allowing them to evolve through collaborative, democratic dialogue. CFERE’s final report is expected to be delivered by theend of spring quarter, a very short turnaround period for a subject of this magnitude. Yet CFERE still has the opportunity to create more transparent dialogue than what we experienced in the fall. We believe that the risks of ongoing collaboration with fossil fuel companies, even for ostensibly climate-friendly purposes, will be obvious in hindsight. The Coalition has published ourpolicy recommendationswith evidence to support this stance. But putting our research aside for a moment, our overall aim is to build a process through which we can work toward a future goal together. Specifically, that goal is focused on 2030: the start of the critical decade in which, as reiterated by recent reports from theIPCCandStanford itself, projected CO2emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure will exceed the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C. Recognizing both the magnitude of this crisis and the need for community involvement, we are hosting our own community dialogue, open to the full Stanford community, on April 6. The event is called “Vision 2030,” a start towards shaping a shared vision for how the Doerr School and Stanford can evolve to become compatible with science-backed climate goals. Our hope is that this event can facilitate dialogue across groups who have not yet engaged face-to-face through existing channels. We recognize that untangling institutional ties with fossil fuel companies will require a thorough and careful process withallparties engaged. We also recognize that even this 3-hour event is nowhere near enough. Our goal is a truly inclusive dialogue that yields a common understanding and common goals, rather than one-way communication channels where final recommendations are handed down unilaterally. Therefore, the Coalition aims to help facilitate a broader, more strategic conversation, including a deliberative democracy approach that is fully cross-sectional and representative. We are actively working with Doerr School staff to bring these plans into reality. The pace of change in our world is unprecedented, and the climate movement is the largest, broadest societal movement in history. Decades of research and activism have brought us this moment. And as we navigate this latest paradigm shift of removing bias in sustainability and environmental research, we believe it is crucial to find a path together, through shared dialogue.

crimson_2023_154,"As University President Claudine Gay’s tenure begins, students have arrived on campus after choking on wildfire smoke, roasting in withering heat, or navigating floodwaters. All have images of the annihilation of Lahaina seared in their minds. How should Gay deal with the climate-traumatized community now in her care? In her previous role as the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,she established the importance of residential deanstaking on “a pastoral role” — “a special responsibility to the well-being of students.” Now, as University President, she has a duty to serve as a moral model. Climate is a deeply moral matter. As the crisis advances to catastrophe and cataclysm, those who pay the price are predominantly people of color, many in the Global South. Unlike elites, the billions living on just dollars a day in slums, townships, and favelas have contributed little to what’s driving destruction. The generational injustice, too, is grotesque. Today’s students face a future degraded by their elders’ inaction. The generations beyond that have no say will lead lives determined by whether we act immediately and aggressively on climate. Given these extraordinary circumstances, will Gay transcend the pastoral and rise to the prophetic? She has a predecessor who serves as an inspiration. James B. Conant, Class of 1914, was at Harvard’s helm when World War II began in Europe. In 1940, before Eleanor Roosevelt had declared “this is no ordinary time,” he made his own personal commitment to actiondespite the derision of isolationists. Through 1941, he committed Harvard’s resources to developing innovation that would prove invaluable. In the hours after the Imperial Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, he fully embraced his pastoral call. Some 6,000 students and faculty jammed into Sanders Theater, Memorial Church, and connected lecture halls across campus to join him in listening to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, delivering his “date that shall live in infamy” speech. Afterwards, he addressed the crowd, many of whom would soon be in uniform. He assured them they would emerge from the shared peril victorious and free. Immediately, hefully committed the school to the struggle.Harvard soon became known as “Conant’s Arsenal.” His crucial role in making the world we now inhabit continues to be honored. Savvy viewers will spot him in Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer.” Today, we are in desperate need for a similar all-in, all-out mobilization on climate. Like WWII, we are getting into the struggle perilously late, after delay and denial. These past months have shown the truth of Thomas Paine’s famous dictum: “Time makes more converts than reason.” There is no longer any need for abstract scientific reasoning to convince us of what has become self-evident. If the incineration of Lahaina isn’t our Pearl Harbor, what will be? What would a mobilized university look like? It would have a fundamental change in focus, far beyond first-stage goals like divestiture and a zero-carbon campus. The absurdity of our current aspirations is obvious when seen in a different context. Sultan Al Jaber, President of the upcoming COP28 United Nations Climate Change Conference, is also the Chief Executive Officer of the United Arab Emirates’ national oil company. His climate cred? He says that his company is planning toreduce the carbon footprint of their oil production processes. Is our “zero-carbon” campus any better? Elite educational institutions churn out graduates empowered and encouraged topursue an outdated, unsustainable lifestyle. Is it really a lifestyle? Given the climate consequences, it may be better to call it a “deathstyle.” Much as “it is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society,” what is the measure of success in a suicidal society? Now, imagine a Harvard that envisions and instills a different sense of identity, of success. Instead of thinking as consumers, we come to understand ourselves as sustainers. That may seem too tie dye and paisley, but our survival as a civilizationmay well depend on it. Harvard’s Class of 2100 might take pride in President Gay’s visionary leadership. She would surpass President Conant’s achievement by helping drive the transformation from consumer culture to sustainer society. Still, Gay can, if she pleases, maintain business as usual. There is no national, much less global, declaration of a climate emergency — yet. She may set aside theurgent pleas of students, faculty,alumni, scientists, and eventhe United Nations Secretary-General. One thing seems certain, though. She will either be the first Harvard president who takes an active, aggressive stance on climate — or the last that doesn’t. Carl Lindemann attended Harvard Divinity School through 1995."
stanforddaily_2023_88,"A departing love letter to the Well House, As my wife Ryelee and I begin to face the inevitable reality that we will be moving on from our resident fellow roles at the Well House, we write today with our hearts full of gratitude and appreciation. When we entered this community nearly two years ago, we found ourselves awestruck by the courage and determination that each of the students at the Well exudes. We have seen firsthand the transformative power of this community. The residents of the Well House are a testament to the fact that building a community that is supportive of students opting for a substance-free lifestyle is not only possible, but also beautiful and fulfilling. They have created a safe and supportive environment where they can learn, grow and thrive at Stanford without substance use. We have seen them support each other through difficult times, celebrate each other’s victories, and build lasting friendships. But the impact of this community goes beyond its residents. It also serves as a beacon of hope for anyone struggling with substance use disorder, reminding them that they are not alone, and that recovery is possible, even at a school like Stanford. It is a testament to the fact that recovery is not a solitary journey, but a collective one, and that support and community are crucial to success. To the resident assistants of the Well House:Your leadership has carried us through the bright and gloomy times over the past two years. You have worked incredibly hard to create a warm environment where students are inspired by your devotion and leadership. Your unwavering commitment and love for the house and its students has been extraordinary. To the students of the Well House:You are an inspiration to us and to countless others. Your courage and perseverance in the face of adversity is nothing short of remarkable. You have created a community that is filled with love, kindness, and hope, and we are grateful to have had the privilege to live with and learn from you. Thank you for being the change you wish to see in the world. To our neighbors living on The Row: We thank you for your willingness to reach out and ask how to support students in recovery living next to you, while at the same time carrying forward the dominant culture traditions passed down by Row students of yore. It has not been perfect, but it has been progress. To the Stanford students in addiction recovery:The sheer willpower to stay sober and maintain a healthy lifestyle in the midst of a campus culture that often glorifies substance use is nothing short of admirable. It takes strength, support, and a level of self-awareness that is not easy to come by. To the rest of the Stanford community:Let us rally around these students and offer them the support and encouragement they deserve. Let us recognize that substance use disorder is a serious and complex issue that affects many, and let us work together to create a culture of compassion, understanding, and support. In conclusion, we want to express our deep gratitude and admiration for the students of the wellness and substance-free housing unit, The Well House, at Stanford University. As the world around you searches for answers to the addiction crisis, you have shown that real-world solutions can and do start at home. You have shown us what true courage, resilience, and community look like, and for that, we are all better off.

stanforddaily_2023_67,"Content warning: This article contains references to eating disorders. I am concerned about the downsizing of plates in the dining hall. As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder and has many friends who have struggled with eating disorders on this campus, interventions like these make recovery harder. This kind of behavioral nudge presents a serious community health issue. The new dining hall plates this year are tiny. They have an eight-inch diameter, compared to standard dinner plates that have 10-inch or 11-inch diameters. This means that the new plates have about 60% of the area of a standard plate. People eat less food when provided with smaller plates. One study published in the Food Quality and Preference Journalaskedparticipants to draw the amount of food they expected to eat for dinner on two different plate sizes. On average, they drew 24% more food on larger plates. These results have been corroborated time and time again. Another studypublishedin the American Journal of Preventative Medicine found thatnutrition expertsgiven larger bowls served themselves 31% more ice cream. As Bryan Wansink, professor of consumer behavior at Cornell,wrote, plate size “can subtly suggest how much food is reasonable, normal, typical and appropriate for us to be serving ourselves and consuming.” This perception leaves people thinking they have eaten enough food, or even too much food, when they haven’t. For this reason, “use smaller plates” iscommondieting advice. The amount of food that can fit on the new dining hall plates is not enough for a meal for me — a semi-active, five-foot-four woman with a medium metabolism. This amount of food is also not enough for many of my friends, with one exclaiming, “Oh! That’s why I’m so hungry,” an hour after dinner when I brought up the small plates. The default meal plan amounts to around two swipes per day, and there is little to no access to free food between meals for most students on campus, so not eating enough at one meal affects students throughout the day. An obvious workaround would be for students to take multiple plates if they need more food. However, people struggling with restrictive eating disorders likely will stop themselves from getting another plate, thinking that needing more than one plate worth of food means they have failed, makes them fat or means they are overeating (this is an eating disorder recovery blogpostreframing getting seconds . Even for people without formally diagnosed eating disorders, there is a stigma associated with getting seconds or taking multiple plates of food. Eating disorders are commonplace among college students. Between 10 and 20% of women and 4 to 10% of men in college currentlysufferfrom an eating disorder, according to the Child Mind Institute. Residential & Dining Enterprises (R&DE should be taking steps to ameliorate this alarming prevalence, especially because eating disorders have thehighest mortality rateof all psychological conditions. With the known ubiquity of disordered eating on this campus, Stanford Dining has no excuse for forcing the student body to follow dieting advice. In addition to harming students who struggle with disordered eating, small plates can aggravate other existing problems. I am sure that this change was instituted with good intentions, maybe as a food waste prevention program or to save costs on food in the dining halls. While it can be argued that portion control is an important life skill, I firmly believe that protecting college students who are particularly vulnerable to disordered eating is more important. And there are other ways to prevent food waste that don’t result in hungry students struggling with whether to go back for seconds. I don’t know all of the solutions, but intentionally restrictive plates are not a viable option. Eliana Fuchs wrote this article.

crimson_2023_10,"You’re on fire. The grins of approval from your classmates. Snaps echoing through the lecture hall. Maybe even a nod from your professor. It s the academic validation and social reward that every Harvard student craves. Maybe it’s what compels you to ask a question in class, one for which you already know the answer, or make a comment with the ulterior motive of brandishing your wokeness. By no means am I saying that all or even the majority of classroom contributions are inherently theatrical. All of us have comments to make that can improve our collective academic experience. It is also important to acknowledge that it takes courage to speak up in a lecture hall or to disagree with someone in a position of power. In fact, it should be the bare minimum to call out racism, homophobia, classism, and any other form of discrimination in our classrooms. The issue arises, however, when we contribute to a self-righteous, narcissistic culture of truisms, and ultimately lower the bar for our academic discussions. Eloquent analyses of social groups and oppression become boxes to check in our classroom monologues of glory. Buzzwords and SAT vocabulary shine, but our commitment to critically thinking about social problems dwindles and our dedication to advertising our moral superiority grows. Sharing an intellectual analysis of Marx’s Das Kapital – making sure everyone in your class knows you read theory – becomes more important than meaningfully engaging in classroom discussions or listening and reflecting on the lived experiences of our classmates. Beyond being annoying, performative acts in the classroom weaponize social justice, redirecting the focus on rewarding individuals for their social awareness rather than dismantling oppressive structures. Social justice has become a race to prove our self-righteousness, and superfluous attempts at proving ourselves as anti-racists have ultimately co-opted the spaces where critical discussions centering rigorous self-questioning and comprehensive debate occur. This culture of conversation rewards performance over nuance and delivery over content, with some of the most insidious forms of hypocrisy and tokenism sacrificing meaningful intellectual growth. We are all left with this strange and disingenuous feeling that our ideological truisms should be advertised, but even more, that social justice is just a glossary of jargon to be used as pawns in a verbal battle of intellectual justice, one you win by using the biggest words and speaking with the most conviction. Worst of all, this culture encourages students to limit their activism to the classroom, and in the classroom only. I mean, what’s in it for us to think that climate change is real if our classmates can’t pat us on the back for it, right? We end up thinking that we don’t have to commit ourselves to social justice because our work in the classroom is enough validation to be labeled a patron for equity and inclusion. In the ivory towers of our Harvard classes, we get to put on the temporary activist hat, appointing ourselves as spokespeople for marginalized groups to which we may not necessarily belong, but ultimately overlooking the victims who feel the brunt of injustice far beyond any classroom. It’s time for a mindset shift. In class, we should not see ourselves as performers on a stage or soldiers in an intellectual battle. As gratifying as we feel it is to speak up in class, we should feel the same zeal for listening and introspection, appreciation for the endless potential that classrooms give us to look inward and expand our own ideological spectrums. This semester, let s reinterpret our classrooms as mediums for critical self-reflection and vulnerability, opportunities to interrogate our preconceived biases and educate ourselves to be more mindful learners. After all, in a world of finger-pointing and constant self-defense, classrooms are one of the safest places for us to swallow our pride and look inwards, and what may momentarily feel like defeat in a heated class discussion can later blossom into a pivotal moment for growth. So, the next time you raise your hand in your lecture, your section, or your seminar, ask yourself if you’re truly interested in contributing to the discussion or if it’s the attention and the approval you crave. Because for marginalized folks and each of us who experiences life beyond the classroom, social justice means more than just outwardly flexing your intellectual muscles or name-dropping obscure social theories – it involves real world issues with real-world implications. Starting from 2023, let’s choose active listening and introspection over mindless interjections, or vulnerability over stubborn dogmatism. It’s time that we raise the bar for what constitutes a meaningful classroom contribution, for ourselves and for others. Rhys Moon ‘26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Matthews Hall."
ubyssey_2023_42,"Feb. 15, 2023 Written byRomina HajizadehandKamil Kanji The Senate meets monthly to discuss and vote on UBC academic matters. But, Senate can often be hard to understand for the average student and theagenda docketcan be super long and dull to read. Senate Recentred is written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month. Here’s what to expect at theFebruary 15Senate meeting. Two items for information are being presented by the Provost’s office this meeting. The first is an enrolment report for this academic year, which reveals information regarding admissions, enrollment and retention and completion rates for both UBC campuses. The report said that applications to UBC in 2022/23 compared to 2021/22, and is described as a “normalization of applications received given a spike in applications during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2022/23 is also the first year that students applied to UBC through EducationPlannerBC. The office is also reporting on the scale and impact of Teaching and Learning Funding Programs at the university, with a focus on the 2021/22 academic session. The summary discusses programs like Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund, the Open Educational Resources Fund, the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Seed Program, the Students as Partners Fund and more. These programs allocate $3.5 million a year to advance teaching and learning goals at the university. The Senate Admissions Committee is looking to approve 2023/24 Winter Session intake targets. The agenda item includes the total full-time equivalent (FTE enrolment for UBC Vancouver 2022/23, which is projected to be 53,332 across the 2022 summer session and 2022/23 winter session. This includes 31,395 domestic undergraduate FTEs, 11,072 Internationall undergraduate FTEs, 9,302 graduate FTEs and 1,563 residence FTEs in Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy. For 2023/24, Bhushan Gopallluni, the vice-provost and associate vice-president faculty planningpro tem, is proposing an enrolment target of 8,597 domestic students and 3,278 for international students. This is an increase of 1.7 per cent of domestic students and a decrease of 0.6 per cent of international students. The Senate Curriculum Committee is bringing forward two policies regarding non-degree programs for approval this Wednesday, which revolve around Diploma Programs and Academic-Credit Certificate Programs. A working group was originally established by the committee in 2019 to review existing policies on diplomas and certificates, which the Senate currently has jurisdiction over based on theUniversity Act, which does not distinguish between credit and non-credit programs. These policies will indicate categories of diploma and certificate programs and their associated establishment criteria, approval processes and relationships with degree programs, among other aspects. There is also a supplemental policy still under development that will aid in defining non-credit credentials.

crimson_2023_142,"I won’t sugarcoat it: You are entering a world where some of the most basic values of our democracy are under attack. Some politicians have found political profit in demonizing certain minorities. Rather than appeal to a broad national community, they preach divisiveness and exclusion. The quest for political power has become an end that in their view justifies these means. It used to be that we could at least debate such dangerous policies. We could openly consider whether we really want to build our nation on such exclusionist dogma. But today, even the facts for that debate are under attack. As the filtering of traditional media has given way to the immediacy of social media, spin and disinformation often replace fact-based discourse. The devaluation of fact is dangerous because a common understanding of reality is a prerequisite to shaping a common vision. It is hard to build a community when we cannot even agree on the world that surrounds us. A “post-fact” environment is also one without accountability. It is a place where politicians can evade responsibility by denying the consequences and even the nature of their acts. Our universities were once considered bastions of deliberation — a setting where policies could be debated and morale visions measured. But too often, even our universities have become infected by a censorious ethos in which disfavored views are no longer challenged and debated, but shouted down and suppressed. For a while, until Harvard’s faculty and students reasserted the principle of academic freedom, I, myself, was excluded because of a dean’s view that certain criticisms — in my case, of Israel — were too threatening, according to a professor who spoke with him. These developments are deeply worrying, but they are not written in stone. They are troubling trends, but they can be reversed. They have not always been, and, with your help, they are not destined always to be. I have faith that these challenges can be overcome because I see the prospect of a better future in all of you. You have grown up in an extraordinarily diverse America. For you, unlike some of your elders, a multicultural society is not a threatening development. It is reality. You are best positioned to defend the decency and respect for differences that alone will allow our nation to come together as a community and prosper. With your Harvard education, you also have the capacity to redeem a fact-based discourse. You can see through the convenient obfuscation of those who pretend that facts are mere opinions. You can resurrect a reality-based discourse that is needed to hold our leaders to account for their actions. And having learned at Harvard how to consider and contest different points of view, you understand the value of free debate. You know that to hear a difficult perspective is not to endorse it. Censorship is the blind rejection used by those who fear knowing. Your education has given you the strength to hear, consider, and even learn from those with whom you disagree. But, you might ask, how can you, a young graduate just leaving the College, possibly make a difference? These are seemingly tectonic trends. How can you influence them? I have spent my professional life at Human Rights Watch taking on powerful forces. The task can seem daunting, but I have seen the enormous difference that even a handful of individuals can make. And not just heroic individuals. Ordinary young people of commitment like you. In fact, your generation is perhaps better placed than any previous one to make itself heard. The same social media that enables the deniers of truth and the purveyors of exclusion gives each of you a platform to push back. We should not cede this platform to deceit and hatred. And even if you prefer in-person to electronic communication, your voice is enormously important. Today, it appears that people are more likely to listen to others whom they know. Institutions are regarded skeptically, but friends and acquaintances are accorded more deference and trust. Your views matter. While each individual’s voice can travel only so far, your collective voice has enormous resonance. It has reach and influence. It has the capacity to serve as a powerful antidote to the callousness and deception that endanger our democracy. Indifference is the enemy of democracy. Resignation is the accomplice of the autocrat. Your engagement is a prerequisite to the future you deserve. Use your voice. Act on your beliefs. Defend your values. These are not naive steps. They are feasible and essential to ensure a world where you will want to lead your adult lives. Kenneth Roth is a senior fellow at Harvard Kennedy School Carr Center for Human Rights Policy and the former executive director of Human Rights Watch."
stanforddaily_2023_71,"There has been a great deal of conversation in our community recently over amotion introducedin the Faculty Senate.Several articleshave appeared inThe Stanford Daily, andtensions were highat the Faculty Senate meeting on May 11.Moving anecdoteshave been shared in response to the suggestion that voting in favor of the motioncould be likenedto Nazi ideology. Notwithstanding the difference between academic freedom and freedom of speech that hasalready been discussed, questions of academic freedom and institutional reputation are undoubtedly within the purview of the Faculty Senate. As an early career academic researcher, there are a few observations I’d like to make that I hope my senior colleagues will consider in their deliberations. First, let’s clarify the stakes. A few months ago, nearly a hundred professorspublicly asked for an accountingfrom University leadership about the position of honor and power bestowed upon Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Mercer as members of the Board of Overseers for the Hoover Institute. After hearing radio silence from the named individuals for several months, two professors introduced a resolution for consideration at the Faculty Senate, the self-organized body where faculty can exercise their governance power over aspects of University operations. It is important to note that the resolution introduced is purely symbolic. The Faculty Senate does not have the authority to sever ties with individuals, nor does the resolution attempt that. It is an opportunity for faculty to discuss the merits of the resolution in their self-organized body. If the resolution were to pass, it asks that senior University leadership take action that only they have authority to do so. Another clarification: there is a very clear difference between someone holding a position of honor, privilege and power like being on the Board of Overseers and someone being invited to give an academic talk. With academic freedom comes academic responsibility to pursue truth with integrity. The greater the position of power, the greater the responsibility. It feels disingenuous to conflate asking University leadership to publicly explain the position of power and honor bestowed upon Murdoch and Mercer with attempts to suppress academic scholarship. Passing a purely symbolic motion in no way sets up the Faculty Senate as “thought police.” In the discussion at the Faculty Senate, there was a warning about a slippery slope if the Faculty Senate motion were to pass. In the words of the President: “To be consistent, the senate could not cherry-pick which appointments to evaluate. Every appointment would need to be scrutinized, on the left as much as on the right. And it is hard to see why only advisory board appointments would be scrutinized. What about the hundreds of guest speakers who are invited to teach in classes or give special lectures?” Notwithstanding the difference between invited talks and positions of privilege, power and prestige outlined above, I fail to see how Stanford being considerate and intentional in building and maintaining relationships is a problem. Weshouldhold the Board of Trustees, Board of Overseers and similar bodies to a higher standard and sever ties with anyone that does not align with our shared values as a community. There is currentlyongoing discussionabout thenew advisory councilfor the Doerr School of Sustainability. Even with the scrutiny, there does not seem to be a “precipitous drop in interest to serve on boards” as the President forewarned. Director of the Hoover Institute and former Provost Condoleezza Rice quoted the Faculty Senate’s foundational statement on academic freedom, saying that “expression of the widest range of viewpoints should be encouraged free from institutional orthodoxy and from internal and or external coercion.” The President of the University, who has used his position of power tocall into questionthe integrity of anaward-winningfreshman investigative reporter, said that passing a symbolic resolution would have a “chilling effect.” Director Rice passionately argued that it was not the place of the Faculty Senate to even consider the resolution, pushing past the two-minute limit allotted to each speaker by Senate rules. In addition to characterizing the resolution as “an attack on Hoover,” Director Rice also attacked a professor and said “you have been a problem this entire time.” Would an Assistant Professor without tenure have been afforded the opportunity to speak past the two minute limit? What about a recognized representative from the undergraduate, graduate or postdoctoral scholar community? When senior University administrators tell the Faculty Senate that they cannot even consider a resolution, the only internal coercion and institutional orthodoxy I see is an attempt to silence faculty by the administration. I can’t help but draw the connection to the gag order on faculty that administrators issued with regard to thegraduate student unionizationefforts. The passionate defenders of academic freedom and freedom of speech didn’t have much to say on that topic. Faculty members can reasonably disagree on the prudence of voting for or against the introduced resolution. Although my views on how I would vote if I had the opportunity are probably clear, it is not my place to discuss the merits of the idea. No matter where you stand on the content of the resolution, however, all faculty members should band together to claim the right and responsibility of the Faculty Senate to speak to matters of academic freedom and integrity. Especially when senior University leadership tries to deny them that ability. Tim MacKenzie, Ph.D. is a postdoctoral scholar in the Genetics Department at Stanford University.

crimson_2023_115,"On Wednesday, March 29, we opened the front doors of University Hall to let in around 50 students tooccupy the building. For eight hours, we waited outside administrators’ offices, calling for an end to Harvard’s complicity in the sexual violence crisis on campus. By far the largest symbol of this complicity is Harvard’s response to multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against Professor John L. Comaroff. Anongoing lawsuitby survivors of Comaroff’s alleged abuse seeks to prove that the University violated the survivors’ rights at multiple points throughout their Title IX investigations, including by illegally obtaining and sharing one survivor’sprivate therapy noteswith Comaroff. Harvard’s actions represent the broader failure of the University administration to take the crisis of sexual violence seriously. We occupied University Hall because of Comaroff, but also because of the myriad of cases of sexual abuse on this campus that fail to make headlines. A2016 studyfound that 31 percent of all undergraduate women and 47 percent of undergraduate women involved in final clubs experienced sexual assault at Harvard; a2019 studyshowed little change, with 33 percent of all undergraduate women surveyed reporting some form of nonconsensual sexual contact. To attend Harvard is to know the pain, trauma, andacademic interruptionthat sexual violence inflicts on so many of us, especially women and queer people. But we were not occupying University Hall just to look backwards at Harvard’s long history of injustice. In our remarks that day, ourpress release,and our direct conversations with College Dean Rakesh Khurana and other administrators, we outlined a vision of how Harvard could move forward. In this piece, we would like to make that vision perfectly clear. It is one characterized by optimism and urgency. Optimism means an insistence that eradicating sexual violence is possible. Anybody involved in the fight against sexual violence — including Harvard’s administrators, employees of the University’s Office of Gender Equity, and student activists — will recognize the feeling that ending sexual violence is an insurmountable task and struggle with a sense of hopelessness. But we contend that we must work towards a world where the number of sexual assaults is zero. We should be guided by amilitant optimism, taking as our goal a complete end to sexual violence rather than a modest reduction or improved response after the fact. Anything less constitutes tacit acceptance that members of our community will experience potentially lifelong trauma andsignificant disruptionto their education. This is simply unacceptable. Our community needs to measure Harvard’s progress against the ambitious goal of achieving zero sexual violence, understanding that we do not yet know exactly how to get there. While playing music, laughing, and sharing stories in the occupied University Hall, we were reminded that working towards the goal of zero can also be positive and beautiful. Ending sexual violence is an opportunity to build a better community, one rooted in care and respect. It will not be easy, nor will it be uniformly positive. But bringing our community together around this goal will generate new knowledge, new practices, and activate the creative and intellectual potential in all of us. Abolitionist feminist Mariame Kaba has a saying:“Hope is a discipline.”Hope is not a passive feeling but an activating conviction, one we must carefully foster by taking active steps to create the world where it can be realized. Our optimism must be accompanied by urgent action. Urgency at Harvard looks like bold, top-down leadership. During our occupation, our condition for leaving before 5 p.m. was simple: We would leave if Dean Khurana sent out a College-wide email naming sexual violence as a crisis and calling for a campus state of emergency to solve it. But by 5 p.m. and in the many days since, no email has been sent. Naming sexual violence as a crisis is a crucial first step to inspiring the urgent response it requires. Addressing sexual violence demands a community-wide effort, with students, administrators, faculty, staff, and residential communities all actively participating in creating solutions. Strong leadership can steer such comprehensive action. During the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Harvard’s top administrators emphasized our collective responsibility in curbing the virus’s spread and transformed campus life. There is no reason why Harvard’s leadership cannot once again take decisive action to safeguard our community. Urgency also means Harvard must accept a leadership role among universities. Harvard prides itself on leading higher education in many fields but is reticent towards leading the fight against sexual violence. Our prevention infrastructure and Title IX policies lag behind others around the nation. Universities with a fraction of Harvard’s endowment nevertheless find funds forindependent rape crisis centersthat provide much-needed campus advocacy in addition to resources for survivors. Some institutions, likeAntioch College, have undertaken bold, collaborative experiments in building communities to prevent sexual violence. Meanwhile, Harvard’s faculty and students are left without comprehensive recourse from the scourge of violence that happens on our very campus and to members of our own community. Those who have tried to fix the problem, like former Anthropology Department Chair Ajantha Subramanian, have left due to alack of institutional support for their efforts. Certainly, we must be thoughtful in the initiatives we undertake to end sexual violence. But the glacial pace of change at Harvard is inexcusable. The richest school in the world has an obligation to devote its significant resources towards leading the charge to end sexual violence on college campuses. The Harvard community, and especially Harvard’s leadership, must move with both optimism and urgency. Rachael A. Dziaba ’26 lives in Pennypacker Hall. William M.

ubyssey_2023_15,"June 29, 2023 Written byIsa Carlin Isa Carlin is a national democratic activist with Sulong UBC and a recent graduate from the UBC iSchool. They have been part of the Filipino national democratic movement since 2019. This past spring, students marched to the UBC President’s office to call on the university to divest from corporations complicit in human rights abuses, including abuses committed in the Philippines. As on-campus activism continues to ramp up, Sulong UBC reflects on the lessons and legacy of Filipino student organizing and that we can draw from this history to respond to contemporary issues. Today, students are agitated about issues that were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic — the skyrocketing cost of food, exorbitant rent increases and ever-rising tuition fees. These same issues were present in the 1960s and 70s, driving the conversation on campuses around the world, including in the Philippines. Sulong UBC — an organization of Filipino students and allies — is an affiliate ofAnakbayan Canada, which launched a campaign in January to honour the legacy of recently- passed Filipino activist Jose Maria “Joma” Sison. Joma was the founding chairperson of revolutionary political organizations and contributed greatly to the historic Filipino and international proletarian movements. In the 1970s, Filipino students like Joma united with workers and peasants in the Philippines to demand changes in the face of socioeconomic inequality. Peasants faced landlessness a situation where landlords own the land where peasants work, characterized by minimal payouts from harvested crops, poverty due to high land rent rates and usury to cover their basic needs. workers faced union-busting and low wages, and students faced high tuition rates. Filipino activists identified that these distinct issues are rooted in an economic system defined by subordination to US imperialism, domestic feudalism and the corrupt profit-driven management of the government — what is called bureaucrat capitalism. (Interested readers can find more inSelected Readings from the works of Jose Maria Sisonor theAnakbayan Canada orientation . After the Second World War, therevolutionaryanti-colonialmovement in the PhilippineswassuppressedbyUS-backed counterinsurgency measures. It took two decades for this spirit to be ignited. In the streets, this reawakening took the form ofmass actions,strikesand critical press; in homes, schools, and workplaces. In the countryside, it appeared as the launching of organizations including the Kabataang Makabayan, the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People’s Army. After the declaration of martial law in 1972 by dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr., the father of current Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Mar- cos Jr., many of the people’s organizations formed during the 1960s and early 70s were forced underground. In 1989, martial law ended. The Philippines saw new organizations, like Anakbayan in 1998, take to the streets and participate in legal civic actions like protests and popular education to organize against the exploitative and oppressive economic system. A Marxist analysis of society developed in the Philippines during the 1960s and 70s, expressed in publications likePhilippine Society and Revolution; this analysis remains the basis of Filipino revolutionary organizing in the Philippines and across the diaspora. As members of Sulong UBC and the national democratic movement, we apply these lessons from youth organizing of the past to present issues at UBC. “The Filipino student movement is very principled,” says Grace Ma, a Sulong UBC Executive Committee member. Through work focused on both the rights and welfare of students and workers at UBC and the organization s “national and international connection” to the Philippines, Sulong stays “grounded on the real issues,” Ma says. The need for strong solidarity between students and workers remains relevant and evident at UBC. On campus, many workers and students alike face food insecurity (especially since the AMSrevokedstaff access to its food bank or live far from campus to cope with the broader housing crisis. Many also bear the double burden of supporting themselves in Canada and sending remittances to their families in the Philippines or other semi-colonies around the world. Lovely Ranges, another Sulong Executive Committee member, notes that “for us to read theory and calling ourselves leftists is not enough. Vancouver is full of people who are ‘radical, but something I learned from the Filipino student movement is that being radical means to actually go out of your way to build a community where everyone collectively cares about each other. When we say ‘for the masses, we want the exploited masses specifically to be the ones to lead us.” The revolutionary potential of students hasn’t gone away — now more than ever, we can change our conditions if we take the time to learn from the lessons of the revolutionary student movements of the 20th century. Through the decades of cumulative experiences that Filipino youth have gained through our own organizing and the revolutionary action of our parents and grandparents, class analysis has led to a powerful Filipino youth movement that can link up with the struggles of the broadest exploited masses. History has shown that solidarity across sectors and peoples based on an anti-imperialist class analysis leads to revolutionary victories. In the Philippines, this worker-student solidarity led to the formation of powerful mass organizations and major political victories throughout the 1970s and 80s, like the ouster of Marcos Sr. Sulong UBC uses the same strategies today. Through a deep connection with exploited people, principles of international solidarity, the study of political theory and a focus on tangible political campaigns, Sulong members aim to raise our consciousness and achieve concrete victories. Victories like increased awareness and material support for Filipino political prisoners likeKarina dela Cerna; a growing connection with Filipino workers and other student organizations on campus in response to rising tuition rates, climate change, food insecurity and the global political and economic crisis; and the expansion of our organization as well. When students and workers unite, we can change our classrooms, our homes, our campuses and our world. This is an opinion letter. It does not reflect the opinions ofThe Ubysseyas a whole.

stanforddaily_2023_26,"The right wants to erase trans people. In the last several days,TrumpandDesantishave both made incendiary claims about gender-affirming care for minors. Trump himselfpromisedthat if elected he would ban transition for all minors nationwide, end federal support for transgender healthcare and “promoting transitionat any age,” and criminalize doctors who provide or have provided gender-affirming care to minor children. With a preponderance of evidence showing thatgender affirmation dramatically reduces suicide rates,including among trans youth, forcibly detransitioning them is a near-genocidal act. So too are laws that would ban drag in public (using language that may include trans people . Unfortunately, one of theprimary propagandistsof this looming erasure is coming here to Stanford to speak. Matt Walsh, director of the transphobic movie “What is a Woman” and self-described “Theocratic Fascist” and “Transphobe of the Year,” is perhaps the most egregious far-right agitator. In the past, among many other things, Walsh has called for theexecution of doctors providing transgender healthcare,attempted to trick trans women and girls into interviews for his movie,blamed drag events for inciting the Club Q shooting,referred to youth gender-affirming care as akin to molestation and rape, andcruelly attacked trans women for living their lives. Matt Walsh wants nothing more than to paint all supporters of “gender ideology” as predators of children. This is the man whom theSCR believesshould “inform students … about the facts surrounding gender issues in order to make good decisions for their health and wellbeing.” The trans students at Stanford do not want your faux concern. I know some at Stanford who are under 18 because they skipped a grade. Bills that would forcibly detransition trans minors are not a faraway issue, but one that would affect our own students. Bills in some states want toextend bans on gender transition to the age of 26. If federal funding were dropped for transgender healthcare, it may limit access to care for all trans people who depend on insurance. As one of the primary drivers of this recent pushback against trans rights, Matt Walsh is a threat to queer people everywhere. For these reasons, Matt Walsh must not speak on campus. This is not a question of freedom of speech, but one of the lives of our queer and trans students. It’s bad enough worrying whether I will be able to safely stay here until 2026 without having to see one of the most ardent believers in erasing people like me. Queer POC have even more to fear with this rise in anti-trans hatred,which has always affected them most acutely. Matt Walsh, the man who wants to put our doctors to death, deny us our identities, and target us as a violent threat, must not be allowed to radicalize an audience of our classmates and neighbors. There is absolutely no room for tolerance of hateful and violent speech. In the 1940s, regarding the Nazis, philosopher Karl Popper put forth the idea of the Paradox of Tolerance: that to maintain a tolerant society, one must be actively intolerant of intolerance. Otherwise, the ability to be tolerant at all will be put into question. This maxim was true then and remains scarily true today. Despite the best efforts of the ASSU,they could not prevent his slated arrival to campus. According to their bylaws, they may not deny applications for funding that meet all criteria. This decision is deeply disappointing, although understandable on its face. However, what isn’t reasonable is the fear that demonstrators would play into conservative tropes about protests or cancel culture. The simple act of condemning Walsh’s vitriolic hatred was enough to get Republicans up in arms (just read the comments on right-wing articles about the ASSU statement . No matter the level of opposition, they will spin it to fit their aims. Conservatives have never been interested in fair debate, and they will play the political game no matter what — with minority students as their pawns. I would rather let them have their temper tantrum away from our most vulnerable students. The upshot of the ASSU’s decision is that the queer students of campus, like many before us, must take our safety into our own hands. For those worried or scared, Queer Student Resources (QSR will be open, providing a safe place for students during the event. And for those angry, don’t be afraid to make your voice heard (just make sure to keep yourself safe . Whatever it takes, Matt Walsh must not be platformed here. Rest in power Brianna Ghey, a 16-year-old trans girl who was senselessly murdered. I’m sorry you didn’t live to see trans liberation."
crimson_2023_51,"Concerns about “kids these days” are as old as Socrates. He once complained that children “no longer rise when elders enter the room” and so “are now tyrants.” The frequency of such complaints has rightly made many numb to claims of generational crises. Butyears of writingabout higher education (and of being a student have convinced me that something is very amiss with recent college cohorts. Unlike past generations, mine grew up with social media and increasingly heavy-handed parents. Plus, the ever-increasing intensity of college admissions and the postgraduate career search means many undergraduates, especially here at Harvard, spend their young adult lives attempting to cultivate a perfect CV. Not coincidentally, my peers face unprecedented mental health struggles. The percentage of Harvard freshmen who have received mental health counseling has nearly tripled in the last 10 years. I’ve come to believe that this generation of undergraduates is infected with a deep fear of not being considered successful. Or, in the words of professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, modern students are “too busy, and they’re too focused on optimizing for certain well-defined notions of success.” From this fundamental insecurity springs risk-averse workaholics who are deathly afraid of any failure. This irreparably taints how they engage in everything from classes to clubs to socializing. One culprit for young adults’ increasing anxiety and stress is, indeed, the internet. Technology has forever changed childhood. The average 17-year-old now spends nearly six hours a day on social media and far less time socializing in person. Asurvey from the pandemic erafound that Harvard College students make frequent use of these apps, too: 15 percent spend five to six hours daily on social media, and nearly 40 percent spend three to four hours. Professor Howard E. Gardner ’65 told me that the amount of time students devote to social media “would have been inconceivable 30 years ago.” The evidence is growing that this prolonged exposure to social media can have long-term negative effects. Onerecent economics studyargued that the introduction of Facebook on college campuses in the mid-2000s causally reduced student mental health. Now, a whopping 95.9 percent of respondents toThe Crimson’s annual freshmansurvey say they have Instagram, an app that has also been linked to mental illness as users constantly compare themselves to others. Former Dean of Freshmen andcelebrated first-year adviserThomas A. Dingman ’67 has already seen these deleterious effects on campus. “There are students who are convinced that nobody else is dealing with the struggles that they’re encountering because the way that people curate their profiles online leads somebody to believe that everybody else is having more fun, working less hard, having more friends,” he said. Changing parenting styles have also left kids with less time to independently roam and socialize. Onepaper from this yearcited this decrease in freedom — a result of excessive parental oversight — as a “primary cause of the rise in mental disorders.” These effects can arise from good intentions, but they remain adverse. As parents increasingly strive “to remove all wrinkles in the pathway that students tread,” Dingman said, Harvard undergraduates become “less resilient and less familiar with overcoming some obstacles.” Greg C. Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, wrote in an email that this overparenting, combined with modern catastrophizing about the state of society, “undermines young people’s internal locus of control, their sense of self-efficacy, their belief in their own resilience, and their hope for the future.” For students attending elite universities, parental overinvolvement has likely consumed their entire lives. Pre-college, parents pressure children to do well in college admissions, raising academic and extracurricular accomplishments as dimensions of insecurity. Just look at the panoply of activities many freshmen take on to win their spot here. Once students arrive on campus, technology interacts with overparenting to ensure that students are never wholly separated from home. Whereas students used to be in touch with parents on a weekly basis, according to Dingman, many more are now in touch every day. Some, like professor Lewis, believe incoming freshmen have relationships with their parents that are “too intimate.” He said that these relationships make it “hard for students to develop, again, their independent identity as an individual.” Wendy D. Fischman, a project director at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who conducted a study including 1,000 undergraduates around the country, told me that one of the most common words used by interviewed students was “mom” — indicating that modern undergraduates don’t ever fully leave home. As a result of these trends, many students arrive on campus incredibly insecure and afraid of failure, having spent their lives comparing themselves to others on social media and being corralled by parents through the admissions rat race. Such insecurities are so pronounced that many longtime Harvard affiliates have taken notice. Gardner, who has seen many generations of Harvard students, told me that the current crop is “more worried and uptight.” Fischman noted that students repeatedly referenced a desire to be perfect, contributing to stress that occurs “daily, if not on the minute.” Professor James T. Engell ’73, too, believes that students have “more anxiety about status” now. In order to allay these anxieties, it seems many students approach college aiming not at learning or intrinsic fulfillment but at continuing to accumulate prestige and set themselves up for career success. Modern students are “so transactional about their college experiences, so focused on building their own resumes, building a profile, having experiences that’ll lead to a job,” Fischman said. Such priorities stand in stark contrast to the experience of older generations. Dingman said that when he was a student, “there was not the scramble to determine postgraduate directions.” Similarly, Gardner, speaking of his and his friends’ perceptions of their futures after Harvard, said, “I think we all felt secure” — the opposite of how I would characterize my peers. This acute need to be exceptional has transformed college from a time of contemplation and curiosity to one of manic overextension, during which worried students amass commitments in an attempt to stand out and land coveted postgraduate opportunities. Engell told me that Harvard students are “here because they have succeeded already in the competition.” While they seek to continue this hard-won sense of success, he said, “at a certain point, not everyone is going to grab the brass ring.” But that won’t stop them from trying. “Students, on the whole, seem to be busier. They are more scheduled. They are more rushed. They are often involved in more activities, a greater number of activities. Their schedules are sliced and diced,” Engell said. First-year adviser Dingman told me this “overscheduling” makes it hard to even find time to have advising meetings. It would be one thing if such commitments came from a place of genuine passion, but Fischman’s research demonstrated that students’ extracurricular involvements were usually “more about collecting activities that they could put on their resume — much less about exploration and trying to discover real interests and passions,” she said. Indeed, each year, swarms of freshmen apply to the Harvard College Consulting Club — despite likely not knowing what consulting was a month before — ostensibly because the club boasts a low acceptance rate and therefore signals prestige. I should know. I was one of many who joined for this exact reason. This is one example of a broader phenomenon in which students’ extracurricular commitmentsoften transitionfrom service-oriented pursuits in high school to pre-professional clubs at Havard — probably because the hallmark of success has shifted from gaining admission to a prestigious college to securing a prestigious job. The business and pre-professional orientation of Harvard student life has become so naturalized that many of my peers likely can’t imagine college without it. I certainly can’t. But, speaking of his own time at Harvard, Dingman said his peers “were choosing their extracurricular activities largely around the things that would give them enjoyment and fun rather than position themselves for anything.” This frenetic and anxious lifestyle transforms classes from the heart of the student experience to a relatively unimportant part of college life. After all, an offer at Goldman Sachs likely won’t hinge on your GPA. Indeed, data on student engagement indicate a long-termdecline in study time. I can relate. Most of the tasks on my to-do list are from various extracurricular commitments, not classes. In addition to courses, social life falls by the wayside. Overworked, perpetually online students have less time to devote to socializing. “To some degree, students hang out less than they used to,” professor Engell said. “They don’t sit and talk for long periods of time without looking at their phones or their laptops.” Dingman concurred. “I don’t think they report the ​​same sort of casual interactions. In part, that’s because I think that they are looking at their extracurricular involvements as sort of pre-professional,” he said. From 2010 to 2021, the share of Harvard seniors reporting drinking at least once a week fell by approximately 20 percentage points. This trend may not seem like a serious problem, and drinking heavily isn’t the only way to have fun. But it reflects a broader decline in socialization and a rise in youth loneliness worth worrying about. I’ve written articles on just about every concerning trend I could document on Harvard’s campus: theculture of non-fun, thedecline of the humanities,increasing careerism, andatrophying free speech. In each of these articles, I’ve too often leaned on institutional explanations, like the College administration’sapparent antipathytowards social life. While I’m still usually skeptical of universal narratives, I’ve come to believe that all of these issues are, in part, symptomatic of the psychological and emotional problems my generation faces. Each can be understood as a case of risk-averse, prestige-hungry students taking the safe option, whether that be concentrating in Economics instead of English, accepting a job at Goldman Sachs instead of a nonprofit, or opting not to speak one’s mind for fear of backlash. In short, kids these days are not alright. The erstwhile pillars of college — self-discovery, exploration, and growth — have given way to an anxious stasis in which students languish in their own fear of failure.

rice_thresher_2023_25,"ByLouis Scheinfeld10/3/23 11:55pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. There has been a lot of discourse regarding Rice Pride’sdecisionto cut ties with Houston Hillel. Yet, throughout this controversy, I’ve noticed an unsettling sense of reluctance to denounce this underlying fact: The precipitating resolution is itself antisemitic. Among others, I contend that Rice Pride’s decision holds all Jewish students collectively responsible for the actions of the Israeli government, applies double standards exclusively to a Jewish organization and disguises contempt for Jews as contempt for “Zionists.” These acts are all problematic and fall under the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’sdefinition of antisemitism. The full IHRA definition is much more extensive and a vital resource for detecting antisemitism. Moreover, the “Three D’s” of delegitimization, demonization and double standards clarify when rhetoric surrounding Israel becomes antisemitic. How could anyone disagree with Rice Pride’s objective of increasing inclusivity? But there are methods to accomplish this without alienating queer Jewish students. Merelystating“We Rice Pride have no intention of excluding Jewish students” doesn’t absolve this decision of its impact on Jewish students, and seems more than anything to serve as a shield for Rice Pride against any claims of antisemitism. In reality, the effects of Rice Pride’s decision are far more foreboding than they claim. The statement ostracizes the Jewish community. It falsely paints Jews as privileged aggressors, as hateful, as against the LGBTQ+ community. It conflates Jewish institutions with oppression. The consequences of this are devastating: It may keep others from interacting with Jewish organizations and from learning about Judaism. Rice Pride s decision likewise depicts Jews and Jewish spaces as unsympathetic to the individual and collective experiences of Palestinian students. Yet, being “pro-Israel” does not inherently mean being “anti-Palestine.” Claiming otherwise grossly reduces the situation and preys on an upholdance of ignorance. I understand why this may feel difficult to grapple with to many people, but the false binary silences people and inhibits us from understanding one another. To me, the specific grounds provided by Rice Pride for cutting ties with Houston Hillel were inconsistent, uninformed, distorted and discriminatory. I imagine that if a Rice organization had cut ties with any other affinity group, by virtue of their own affinity, the entire university population wouldn’t hesitate to denounce such actions. People wouldn’t be content with merely decrying the decision-making process or the timing of the announcement; they’d condemn the reprehensibility of the action itself. So, why is this not the case here? The extreme backlash the board of Rice Pride has faced is reprehensible. It is important to acknowledge that the threats they received are unjust, while not distracting from the underlying problem. It shocks me how purportedly caring, intelligent individuals can have such little regard for the impact of their conduct on Rice’s Jewish community. The antisemitic sentiment rooted in their reasoning likewise frightens me. The board’s decision reveals their lack of consideration and knowledge about the issues and community they sought to make a statement on. This highlights why they should never have cut ties with Houston Hillel in the first place; clearly, more dialogue between the two groups is necessary to better understand each other, not less. Antisemitism is not just swastikas, stereotypes and Kanye West tirades. What most Jews know, and perhaps non-Jews do not, is that antisemitism is often much more inconspicuous. Antisemitism, really just a fancy term for “Jew hatred,” has endured throughout history because of its adaptability and discreteness. “Jew hatred” is unambiguously bad. But call it something else, such as anti-communism (historically or anti-Zionism, or hide it behind a positive goal, such as an effort toward greater inclusivity, and the lines of loathing seemingly blur. The more you can ostracize us, the more you can stereotype us, the more you can blame us without backlash, the stronger antisemitism becomes in a society. Ignorance feeds into this. Antisemitism does not just pop up out of nowhere. To fight it, we need to identify it, and we need to have the courage to disavow it. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

ubyssey_2023_39,"March 6, 2023 Written byNathan BawaanandAnabella McElroy “Disillusioned.” Along with buzzwords like “transparency” and “engagement,” this word seems to always come up during AMS Elections, and this year is no different. We vote for our student government and pay our university tuition, and expect fair treatment from both in return. In a year when it feels like these institutions didn t listen to students on issues like food security, health care or tuition, it can seem like voting doesn t produce real change. But, your vote has the power to solve, or at least reduce, discontent with UBC and the AMS. Students have a choice to make this year: either stick it through with status quo votes and incumbents or pick a new path paved by first-time “outsider” candidates who outnumber returning candidates in this year’s elections. In the races for AMS exec positions, three of the five races have a candidate who is currently working in the AMS. And in some of these races, the non-AMS candidate could win. Over in the Senate races, few incumbents are running for reelection. For the Board of Governors, no incumbents are running. And though there is the potential for fresh blood in the governance bodies at UBC, there’s also the potential for stagnation, with some incumbents jumping from one governing body to another. But the point still stands: students will be electing a wave of fresh faces this year. And a single vote can sway an election — we’ve seen underdog candidatescome close to winningthanks to students coming out to vote in the past. While uncontested candidates might seem like a shoo-in — and this year there are a few after a bunch of candidates dropped — students have the power to vote ‘no’ if they don’t believe these candidates will represent them well or are up to the job. Though voting ‘no’ seems counterintuitive since it would mean having a by-election at a later date, it could create opportunities for more qualified candidates to enter the race, for candidates who represent you to enter the race. This year’s elections are all about pushing for change — change that your vote has a major stake in. And the strength of your vote doesn’t just end with electing your representatives, but with referenda items that will impact students across campus for decades to come. Two referendum questions are related to the AMS/GSS Health & Dental Plan: one asking to raise the fee by around $52 to maintain the same level of coverage and another to raise the fee by $8 to include gender-affirming care under the plan. The gender-affirming care item is conditional on the other increase passing. Another question is on raising the Bike Kitchen fee by $3 to ensure the service can continue to operate after this same referendum failed last year.

crimson_2023_139,"As a former Harvard College instructor and in my current role at the Harvard Language Center, I try to stay abreast of essential innovations in artificial intelligence — for instance, the current marvelous ease of cheating. I therefore asked ChatGPT for a circumscribed assist with this piece: 50 words of advice for the class of 2023. It obligingly gushed, “Congratulations, Class of 2023! As you enter the next phase of your lives, remember to stay curious, never stop learning, and seek opportunities to make a positive impact in the world. Be resilient in the face of challenges, stay true to your values, and always prioritize your well-being. Best of luck!” This valediction is about as innovative as the printing press, but I suppose the algorithm is designed to avoid provocation, unlike a cranky middle-aged Harvard administrator. Though I don’t disagree with the sentiment, I do want to push it further: Class of 2023, in this world of proliferating technological wonders, remember that your true potential lies in what makes you human. I’ve gotten a handful of emails over the last year of the “Your students should use AI to learn languages!” variety. These app creators are laudable in their enthusiasm for their products, as well as laughable in their one-size-fits-all approach to college-level language instruction and their confidence that an academic institution would be eager to do away with flesh and blood instructors. Given my background in teaching and my championing of the Harvard Language Exchange program, it follows that I will never completely cede language learning to the machine. But AI is here to stay, and it will only get more sophisticated. Despite all the panic about it coming for our jobs or sparking the Skynet apocalypse, we’ll have to approach it pragmatically. In an ideal world, we will integrate itinto our academic lives as a toolas we reexamine what “human” skills are critical for students to acquire within the liberal arts curriculum. The wonderful opportunities that natural language processing and other forms of AI have presented us can, and should, only ever be augmentative, lest we lose our thirst for cultural exchange: the delight of discussing what makes a great fish curry with a new Bengali friend, explaining the subtleties of Rickrolling to the visiting German student, the first time you use the subjunctive spontaneously, or when you tell your French friend just what you think of Balenciaga’s puffer jackets. Within the Harvard student body, more than 150 countries are represented. What would our institution be if we replaced more than 8,000 students and scholars with chatbot-powered avatars? I certainly don’t need to preach to the Class of 2023 the effects of losing our sense of community, given the cascades of existential crises of the last several years that have caused, and were caused by, our collective and individual isolation. And it doesn’t help that, when faced with these crises, the impulse of the educated is to burrow deeper into our respective dens, insulating ourselves from contrary opinions and doomscrolling our way through hopelessness. The machine expects nothing of us but our passive presence, and eventually will give up on even that (yes, even Duolingo will abandon its “Ready to practice your Portuguese? Keep Duo happy!” nudges . Humans are harder. Harder, messy, prone to misunderstanding, and irritating in their demands for both accountability and simultaneous adjustment of our own expectations. And yet, how much is lost in a Google translation, and only understood through serious study or real-world interaction? Your horizon stretches a little more when you realize, for example, the extent to which your views about a particular culture boil down to stereotypes, or why that Neapolitan waiter wouldn’t bring you a cappuccino after dinner. The sleek beauty of tech is that it doesn’t call for empathy or negotiation. It’s obsolete within months and doesn’t complain when you toss it in the trash. Each human conflict or connection, however, strains the bounds of your world, fires new synapses, and reaffirms your uniqueness. Each worthwhile human relationship requires renewal. As you go forth from the protected space of Harvard, into a world grappling with political division, climate change, economic anxiety, and social inequality, don’t be afraid of tech — use it in all the ways that enhance our current imperfect realities. But don’t forget the immense power of human collaboration in the face of staggering obstacles. But I’d be remiss if I didn’t ask for a final word from our friendly chatbot. ChatGPT, what is the value of human collaboration? “Human collaboration combines diverse skills, knowledge, and perspectives to achieve common goals and create greater impact than individuals can achieve alone.” Good bot.

crimson_2023_92,"Around this time of year, it feels like there is immense pressure to make some sort of novel commentary about Black history. But while Black History Month is certainly a time to look back on the past, it is also a time to celebrate the triumphs of Blackness. In brainstorming what I could write about this month, I found myself constantly thinking, “That’s too basic” or “I don’t have anything new to say.” Then I realized: Why write about something new at all? I could simply write about the things that I loved about Blackness. In no particular order, as my way of celebrating Black History Month, here are a few of my favorite things about Blackness: I think specifically of my mother and grandmother when writing this, but also of the countless other Black women who I have looked up to as role models. Black women are one of the most oppressed groups in the United States. Looking strictly at the wage gap, in 2019 Black women would have had to work, on average,eight extra months per yearto earn the same amount as their white male colleagues. In our nation, in which Black women are valued among the least for doing the same work, some might be inclined to give up — to lose the motivation to be educated simply to enter a dehumanizing system. Not Black women. Census data shows that Black women, in the face of all this, are overrepresented amongst women who earn master’s degrees. This is just one example of the resilience Black women display by defying the odds stacked against them — every day. From Michelle Obama to our very ownPresident Claudine Gay, Black women continue to raise the bar and set the standard for excellence. From the Impressions’ “Keep on Pushing” to Solange’s “Don’t Touch My Hair, Black artists have been channeling hard times into creating uplifting music and art for years. Black art is a reminder of not only all that we have overcome, but also how ably we can express ourselves, even in the face of adversity. Music, by turning struggles into content that a wide audience can digest, has the unique power to push Black issues into the mainstream while also serving as a healing mechanism for Black people. Expressing ourselves through music dates back to slavery. It has certainly evolved in purpose since then, but it carries much of the same power. Whether it’s soul food, Haitian food, or Nigerian food, our cuisine is so versatile. I love its many cross-cultural influences and historical roots, despite the often painful history behind them. So much of the food from the Deep South has African roots. While much of their culture was stripped from them, slaves were able to maintain ties to their roots through food. In thinking about the foods of my family, one that sticks out is cornbread. Today, it’s a special treat that I enjoy homemade by my mother on holidays, but for slaves it was part of a regular diet, as it was easy to prepare, portable, and wouldn’t spoil easily while working long days in the fields. Many staples of soul food have practical ties to being enslaved, and while I eat them today because they taste good, they also serve as a reminder of my ancestors’ relationship to these staples. Admittedly, I am scared I won’t be able to pass this aspect of Black culture on to my kids, as I cannot cook at all. But for posterity’s sake, I certainly feel inclined to learn. Black community is itself a deeply powerful force, wherever one finds themself. Even in a predominantly white space like Harvard, the very presence of Black community makes me feel so seen and heard. It can be just a nod of acknowledgement on the street or anentire party celebrating our presencein a space that was not built for us. Regardless, the coming together of our community is a force to be reckoned with. I could go on forever about all the things I love about Blackness, but I will leave you to your own reflections. This Black History Month, take the time to appreciate Black history — but remain present, too. It is so easy to reach back into the past and marvel at how far we have come and how far we have yet to go in the fight for equality, but this month is about more than just history. It gives us the much-needed opportunity to pause, for just a moment, and appreciate the beauty of Blackness in the midst of endless struggle. Kayla A.

rice_thresher_2023_33,"ByThresher Editorial Board8/22/23 10:46pm In an email to staff yesterday, Dean Gorman said that Rice has let go of Adjaye Associates, the architecture firm in charge of designing the new student center, and reset the RMC rebuild project. For starters, we want to applaud Rice for cutting ties with Adjaye Associates. This announcement arrives a month after the Financial Times uncoveredallegations of sexual misconductagainst Sir David Adjaye, the founder and principal of the firm. While the email didn’t specify why they let go of Adjaye Associates — Gorman also attributed the RMC reset to post-COVID inflation and frustration over design plans — we can’t help but point out that Rice is joining the list of many clients who dropped Adjaye Associates after the allegations surfaced. We feel strongly that Rice should not maintain a relationship with any individual accused of sexual misconduct, and appreciate that they made the right decision in parting ways. Now, the RMC rebuild has essentially returned to square one — or square 1.5, considering Gorman also said that donor money is still wrapped up in the rebuild project. Rice administration should use this opportunity to re-evaluate the intentions of the RMC rebuild and emphasize student needs in the future design. Administration didsolicit inputfrom undergraduate and graduate students on the original redesign. However, we question how much that input was valued, given how many student spaces wound up compromised. The previously proposed design put student media in the basement, Pub in a U-shaped food court and gave Coffeehouse an exterior pickup window. These student-run organizations shape Rice’s culture. Between class periods, you’d be hard pressed to find a place more packed than Chaus. Pub largely defines our post-lab Thursday nights. ktru’s stickers decorate water bottles and laptop sleeves around campus. To sideline these organizations, cram them into tight spaces and strip them of their quirks would be, in our opinion, conventionally unwise. The original redesign also moved organizations previously housed elsewhere, such as the Center for Career Development and the Whoo Deli, into the RMC. These would be located on the second floor, sharing space with support services like the Queer Resource Center and the Women’s Resource Center. Moving forward we urge the administration to rethink their priorities surrounding the RMC rebuild. We encourage Rice to hire a new architecture firm that understands Rice culture and constructs a building to suit its needs. The new student center must be bigger, too. The original redesign planned to increase the RMC’s size by15 percent, a number that we feel is too low, given Rice’s plans toexpand the student bodyand constructtwo new residential colleges. The addition of even more food offerings and work spaces can only further complicate the struggle to give students the space and resources that a student center is intended to provide. Most importantly though, we urge administration to put students’ needs first when re-redesigning the new student center. Student-run businesses and media organizations should have a voice in what their spaces look like. We’ve been saying this for years. In 2019, our former editorial boardarguedthat the rebuild must accommodate the needs of student media, including radio equipment for ktru and private spaces for the Thresher to conduct confidential interviews. Four years and several iterations of our board later, we still echo that sentiment. Some of our staffers spend upwards of 20 hours per week in our office — give us some natural light, please.

Current members include Prayag Gordy, Riya Misra, Nayeli Shad, Brandon Chen, Sammy Baek, Sarah Knowlton, Hadley Medlock and Pavithr Goli.

state_press_2023_47,"Redshirt senior safety Jordan Simone (38 receives medical attention on the field after sustaining a knee injury against Washington on Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015. The injury put Simone out for the remainder of the season. College football players at ASU need better health care because of the inherent danger of playing the sport, including long-term health risks. Over 250,000 NCAA injuries were estimated between 2014 and 2019. Long-term health is also a factor, as agrowing field of researchhas proved that college football players suffer more brain-related issues as they age. As the world saw on Jan. 2, Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest on the field. It was a terrifying moment that, unfortunately, fits into the larger context of the extreme danger that comes with playing football. Given these inherent risks, college football players at ASU and around the United States need high-quality health care and health insurance for the short and long-term. Under NCAA rules, athletes arerequiredto have a basic health and accident plan. Most Division I universities provide this basic care, but they are not required to. Depending on their insurance coverage, players can be subject to significant out-of-pocket expenses. There are two health and accident plans provided by the NCAA: the catastrophic injury insurance program and the Exceptional Student-Athlete Disability Insurance Program. The catastrophic injury insurance program operates at a deductible of $90,000, meaning it only kicks in once $90,000 has been paid through different coverage. However, an important limitation of the program is that an athlete can only use it if they report their injury within two years. Athletes that learn of their injuries later in life would be excluded from the policy. This is especially true of the long-term effects of concussions, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Alzheimer s disease. TheExceptional Student-Athlete Disability Programprovides high-profile athletes with insurance in case they suffer a career-ending injury. However, like the other programs, it has limitations. Players have to prove that they will have high professional draft stock, in a rather ambiguous process, and they also have to pay high premiums if the program is enacted. Disability coverage goes into effect if an athlete is disabled playing their sport. But, if they were able to work a full-time job after their injury, insurance benefits can be cut to zero. That s just for the full disability benefits, too; the partial disability benefits can be cut even more because it is assumed that the athlete can still work in some capacity. The insurance programs that are provided to college football players areinadequate. This is especially the case given the nature of long-term injuries, particularly head injuries, that are inherent to the sport. ASU should go out of its way to ensure that long-term coverage is provided to all Sun Devil athletes if they need it, even outside of the time that the athlete plays for the team. All schools can always provide additional insurance coverage, said Aaron Hernandez, the director of the Sports Law and Business Program at theSandra Day O Connor College of Law. Outside of ASU and the NCAA, the Pac-12 Conference helps provide for athletes who need coverage after their college athlete career is over. Specifically, for ASU players … four years post-separation, Pac-12 athletes are still covered for injuries and medical associated expenses that come from athletics, Hernandez said. Yet, like the other programs, it does not cover long-term injuries after those four years, and it can be hard to prove that injuries did occur when taking part in athletics. It is true that the benefits described are better than what most people in the U.S. receive. But, it s also true that the bar for health insurance in the U.S. is incredibly low. According to astudydone by The Commonwealth Fund in 2021, the U.S. ranked last in a study of 11 high-income nations about each country’s health care system. The difference? All of the other countries had some form of universal health care. This phenomenon is not separate from the insurance that college football players receive in the U.S. In fact, it is inextricably linked to it. Athletes have to deal with higher education s convoluted, inadequate health care system because it s part of the broader flawed U.S. system. Just like for every other working person in the U.S., a good portion of health care for college football players is tied to their employment — even though they aren t legally classified as employees (yet . It is an unfair system that prioritizes money over human life, and in the case of a dangerous sport such as college football, the need for life-affirming health care could not be more prevalent. ASU should provide better care to its athletes who generate millions of dollars in revenue, and its athletes and the general public should demand a health care system that allows people to live freely and healthily instead of being trapped and beaten down.

crimson_2023_84,"I always thought that I sounded pretty neutral, geographically-undefined. It was something I was proud of. Of course, I shouted “y’all” to address a group of people, said “I reckon” every now and then, and even used the oh-so-Southern “the devil is beating his wife” whenever the sun shined in the rain. But I took pride (sometimes to the point of arrogance in the fact that I spoke without the accent. No one would be able to tell I was from the South. Well, no one should be able to tell. At least, that’s what I thought. I had always hated the accent. To me, it was the accent of hillbillies, hicks, and rednecks; people who drove jacked-up pickup trucks and made moonshine in their backyards, everything and everybody I wanted to stay as far away from as possible. For me, the accent symbolized something much more than just a way of speaking. It wasn’t just one of the perhaps thousands of regional linguistic quirks in the English language. The accent symbolized a way of thinking, and that way of thinking was opposite to everything in which I believed. My lack of the accent wasn’t the only trait that I thought set me apart in my Southern town. I felt like an outsider in every sense of the word. I lean left while Greenville, South Carolina leans the exact opposite. I had mostly left competitive sports behind while athletics defined the lives of many of my Southern peers. I don’t even own a single piece of camouflage clothing (a mortal sin . The accent symbolized everything I wasn’t. And it certainly didn’t help that the only result that shows up when you search “governor with Southern accent” on Google is South Carolina’s very own Henry McMaster. It seemed I had only one option for a place so equivocally unlike myself: leave. Imagine my horror, then, when I came to Visitas in April and heard words that still haunt me to this day. “You’re from the South, aren’t you?” I had the accent. I felt like I had been exposed even though I had no secret to hide. I was going to introduce myself as “Mac from South Carolina” anyways, but the way people said “the South” has stuck with me since then. For the first time in my life, I had been forced to reconcile with the idea that I was indeed from the South. I couldn’t pretend to be a neutral-accented, progressive-minded, geographically-undefined person anymore. I had to be from “the South.” Over the summer I decided to learn how to speak “neutrally” — though I now use that word with great reservation after my supposedly neutral accent was effortlessly detected. I spent weeks reading about tongue placement and cadence, even watching Youtube videos making fun of the accent so that I could banish every detectable aspect of it from my speech patterns. And for the most part, I was successful. To quote my friends down South, I sounded like a “damn yank.” I still turn heads when I drop an “ain’t” or have a “hankerin’” for something, but I take it as a great compliment whenever someone can’t tell that I’m from below the Mason-Dixon Line. For 18 years I hated what the accent stood for. I hated that other people viewed it so negatively. To me and the rest of the country, the accent was synonymous with a lack of education, my greatest fear. Even a person like me, born and raised in the South to parents born and raised in the South, had a deep internalized bias towards the accent. I held such great contempt for the negative perception of the accent that I didn’t realize I was partially responsible for this negative perception. Attempting to drop the accent and engaging in my “Cantabrigian Code-Switching” (as I have come to call it , an action that occurs even in professional academia and research, only emphasizes the perspective that the accent is the mark of ignorance. When Southerners in the world of academia don’t speak with the accent, they are perpetuating the mainstream view because it demonstrates to those without the accent that “smart” Southerners truly don’t have the accent. Indeed, in a perfect world, the accent would be seen as just that: an accent. But right now, it isn’t. While I know that I am doing nothing but harm to the South’s image (an image which already has plenty of negativity , I still don’t use the accent in Cambridge. “If I heard you with an accent, I would have thought of you completely differently,” joked one of my friends as I was explaining this concept to her, but unfortunately, I agree with her. While I now understand the damage that suppressing my accent does, the internalized bias is still there, and I’m not sure if it ever won’t be. I truly do love to talk about the South, both the good and the bad. I love reminiscing about the refreshing chill of sweet tea, or the unmatched atmosphere of an SEC football game, or even why the South Carolina Statehouse has cannonball holes in it (think William Tecumseh Sherman . And whenever I talk about my sometimes-beloved sometimes-hated home, it s always with an accent. But the accent I use here in Cambridge isn’t “the accent.” I use my painstakingly-researched “neutral” accent. That isn’t “my accent.” Mac M. Mertens ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Weld Hall."
thetech_mit_2023_12,"Apparently a very small number of advocates, upset with last year’sReport of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Freedom of Expressionand the passage of theMIT Statement on Freedom of Expression and Academic Freedomin December, put up posters on campus to protest what they saw was problematic protection of free expression. Their efforts were, no doubt, well-intentioned, but they were, shall we say, strategically questionable. I am along-timeadvocate of gay rights as well as an advocate of freedom of expression, and I was a member of the Ad Hoc Working Group. I wish to make several observations about these posters. First, as a matter of campus policy and consistent with the MIT Statement allowing time, place, and manner restrictions, these flyers were posted in violation of MITposter policy, which requires posters to “indicate a sponsoring organization and contact information.” In other words, contrary to what the flyers imply, unauthorized and anonymous flyers wouldnotbe “protected” expression. Second, satire works only if you are in on the joke, and feedback I have heard is that there are members of the MIT LGBTQ community who missed the fine print and really felt this was hate speech directed toward them. This is unfortunate and tragically ironic. Third, the poster quoting the Westboro Baptist Church provides us with a teachable moment. The WBC is described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as “arguably the most obnoxious and rabid hate group in America.” They are so far out on the lunatic fringe that their efforts have been consistently counterproductive. Counter-protest numbers typicallyeclipsethe small number of WBC protesters; the obnoxiousness of their positions and the strength of counter-speech they have evoked has often increased sympathy and support for gay rights. To be clear: I obviously disapprove of their message, but the use of their most infamous slur is closer to harassment, threat, and intimidation than it is “free speech.” Prohibiting speech because some may be offended is not only counter to freedom of expression but also to the cause of social justice. This is precisely why so-called Hate Speech campus codes in the 1990s were abandoned or struck down, as they ended up being used against the very groups they were intended to benefit. As Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean of the U.C. Berkeley School of Law, and Howard Gillman, Chancellor of the University of California, Irvine, noted with respect to the speech code adopted by the University of Michigan in 1988, “in practice, the code was used not against the kinds of purely hateful slurs that inspired its passage, but against people who expressed opinions that others objected to. Complaints were filed against a student who stated that Jewish people used the Holocaust to justify Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians for example ” (Free Speech on Campus . These days, what counts as hate speech may depend on one’s religious and political views, and if we prohibit offensive speech then we no longer have freedom of expression since virtually any utterance about current controversies will offend someone. Fourth, another poster suggests the reader “Call their your legislator” to support anti-gay legislation. This has nothing to do with MIT policies, since everyonealwayshas the right to express their political opinions privately. Nothing in the MIT report or statement has anything to say about what private citizens communicate to their elected officials. Other posters I have seen, and I cannot claim to have seen them all, use insulting language and purport to support anti-gay policies. Some of these not only fail to identify the author clearly and legibly (which fails to follow MIT poster policy , they also fail to identify their intent as satire, meaning they are just plain insulting. They harm the very group that the posters are apparently interested in defending. There are far better ways to advance the cause of gay rights. In the past few decades, gay rights in the US have made remarkable progress, moving from the Supreme Court’s awful decision inBowers v. Hardwick(1986 allowing states to criminalize homosexual sodomy, to decisions that recognize gays and lesbians as a constitutionally protected group (Romer v. Evans,1996 , directly overturningBowers(Lawrence v. Texas, 2003 , ensuring a national right to same-sex marriage (Obergefell v. Hodges,2015 , and ensuring the legal right not to be discriminated against in employment decisions (Bostock v. Clayton County,2020 . Gay rights would not be where we are today without freedom of expression, including the right to protest. Expression exercised in the street, in the media, and in the courts has resulted in great progress and changes in public opinion. Over the last 25 years, for example, support for same-sex marriage has risen from 27% to over 70%, according toGallup survey data. As the MIT Statement notes, “Free expression is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition of a diverse and inclusive community.” Freedom of expression, as history has proved, is an ally in the cause of gay rights, not its enemy.

state_press_2023_10,"Thunderous kills. Perfectly-placed aces. A vibrant team culture. The ASU women’s volleyball team is back with a bang. Combining a killerrosterand a savvy new coach makes this team the best ASU has ever produced. The team is 17-1, their best start since 2015. The hot start makes them just the second ASU women s volleyball team since 2000 to win at least 14 straight matches to begin the season. They are also rankedNo. 19in the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA rankings. This success is a marked difference from ASU s combined 33-50 record over the past three years, partly due to newcomer head coach JJ Van Niel. Van Niel said he is eyeing the upcoming NCAA tournament in December but is taking it one match at a time, especially in conference play. “I m proud of our team for being 15-1, but to me, it s about how we do in the Pac-12,” Van Niel said. “How can we get through and win enough matches to make the tournament?” READ MORE:New ASU women s volleyball coach to bring unity back to 2023-24 season The players view their strong start as a culmination of the effort they have put in on and off the court over the past few months. “We worked our butts off in the gym, in the weight room… we had a really high team GPA, and I feel like it was well deserved, Shields said. “I m not surprised with our success, and I m proud of us.” The start to the season not only showed the rest of the conference ASU s full potential but also proved it to the team. “This serves as motivation now to keep it up and to prove ourselves,” senior outside hitter Marta Levinska said. “(We just keep improving ourselves because I think a lot of people think that we don t deserve the hype.” READ MORE:ASU volleyball remains undefeated after beating Washington ASU is peaking as collegiate women’s volleyball is riding a wave of popularity nationally. Earlier this year, the Nebraska women’s volleyball team broke the attendance record for a women’s sports event with 92,003 fans showing up to watch their season-opening match against University of Nebraska-Omaha. The Sun Devils also sold out Mullett Arena in their first home game, which was a straight set victory over intrastate rival UA. Not only was the attendance of 4,816 fans the highest since 2015, it was also the third-most attended volleyball game in ASU history. Despite one loss to No. 3 Stanford, the Sun Devils have dispatched their conference opponents since the start of Pac-12 play. Over the weekend, both UCLA and USC came to Tempe and left with a loss. On Sunday, the Sun Devils beat USC in front of a crowd of over 2,500 fans in Mullett Arena. ASU s team is defined by mentality of constant improvement. “We re going into the hardest part of the season, which means we have a bunch of tough matches in a row right now,” Van Niel said. According to Shields, Van Niel went into the locker room and wrote down the team’s goals on a whiteboard after the Sun Devils first loss of the season to Stanford. From Van Niel s perspective, a constructive attitude is key to dealing with hurdles to the team s success. You have to keep moving forward and work through those situations, Shields said. “It s not the losses that define a team (but what you do after those losses, we just have to stick to those goals, and we have to continue to trust in one another.” This is a testament to the team s resilience and its optimistic future prospects, exactly why this year s roster is so special. “The sky s the limit,” Levinska said. “We can beat every team and we can play against any team.” With women’s sports on the rise and viewership records being broken across the board, ASU’s dominance this season is more than just great play on the court. It s a reflection of how incredibly women s sports have been doing, and proves why they should be taken more seriously. ASU will take on Stanford again on Oct. 29 at Mullett Arena. Students should fill up every seat to support the greatest volleyball team to ever wear maroon and gold.

stanforddaily_2023_40,"Eric’s mom posed a seemingly simple question — “My son has Down syndrome. Do you think you can teach him how to read?” I was a first-year special education teacher. My experiences trying to improve Eric’s reading skills taught me so much more than I would have ever imagined about the importance of believing in possibilities and how placing students into predefined categories too often limits their futures. My memories of teaching students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD continue to be the happiest of my life —their energy, honesty and amazing potential were invigorating on a daily basis. However, ensuring my students were fully integrated in the school with their peers without disabilities was a constant struggle. Two decades later, the progress we have made in truly including students with IDD in school communities has been dramatically insufficient. As the Supreme Court is poised to consider the constitutionality ofaffirmative action, many are reflecting on the importance of diversity in higher education settings. Almost all major universities now have a president- or provost-level office focused on enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI . These efforts have led to university campuses being filled with a broader array of students of color, from lower income households, of various faiths, and from the wide LGBTQI+ continuum. Many of us believe that this diversity has substantively improved college communities and that it plays an important role in moving us into a fairer society. Although improving equity in access to higher education remains a work in progress, it is an appropriate time to reflect on which individuals remain outside the purview of what our society deems to be “college material” — namely students with IDD. A bold move would be for Stanford and other universities to expand DEI efforts to include these students in our academic communities by creating inclusive post-secondary programs that are fully integrated into campus life. At most institutions of higher education in the United States, DEI initiatives do not extend to this group of students. We are ‘inclusive,’ but only for students who fit within the category of who we think is valuable enough to contribute to our elite, exclusive and important world. I have been working in special education, as a teacher and now a researcher, for two decades, and I recently connected my work to the salient ideas in “Why Fish Don’t Exist”by Lulu Miller. We, as a society, too often create categories and hierarchies that are unfair, wrong, and, worse, prevent us from evolving beyond our current conceptions of the world. Miller’s book tells about a journey to understand how to overcome a personal setback. As she sought out role models of people who overcame challenging situations in their own lives, she discovered David Starr Jordan, the first president of Stanford University. A leading ichthyologist in his prime, he was credited with discovering a large percentage of known fish species. However, he was also a staunch supporter of eugenics who believed that individuals with IDD should be sterilized and institutionalized. Decades later, we know that David Starr Jordan was wrong about so many things — fortunately Stanford has responded by removing his name and likeness from many parts of campus. As Miller cleverly details in her book, he was wrong about fish. They aren’t a closely related group of creatures — the category is false and was naively created based on features assumed to matter. We also know he was wrong about people with IDD. Individuals with IDD are valuable, vibrant humans who deserve lives full of happiness, friendship, independence and love. Post-secondary programs for individuals with IDD are a clear next step for DEI initiatives.Think Collegeis a national project that has been leading the effort to make universities more inclusive for students with IDD. Their work has made it clear that post-secondary programs for students with IDD are incredibly beneficial and lead to substantial improvements in employment, satisfaction with social life and independence. Not only will students with IDD benefit from university opportunities, but the broader educational environment on campus will also grow stronger by embracing this diversity. Making colleges representative of society will allow our future doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects, artists and teachers to get to know people with different lived experiences, helping universities prepare the next generation of leaders to build a more inclusive, equitable world. What a statement it would be if Stanford, the institution formerly led by David Starr Jordan, evolves into a model of inclusive higher education. I am hopeful that my colleagues and I can make this happen by establishing a post-secondary program for individuals with IDD at Stanford. If you are interested in contributing to this effort, we would be happy to hear from you. As Miller states, “I have come to believe that it is our life’s work to tear down this order, to keep tugging at it, trying to unravel it, to set free the organisms trapped underneath. That it is our life’s work to mistrust our measures. Especially those about moral and mental standing. To remember that behind every ruler there is a Ruler. To remember that a category is at best a proxy; at worst, a shackle.” Christopher J.

crimson_2023_173,"Recently, a friend and I were debating the true value of a Harvard education (no, not the dollar cost . After much competent but inconclusive chin-wagging, I channeled my inner former University President Neil L. Rudenstine, mouthedsome digression about cultivating global leaders, and hastened on to other topics. It got me through the evening, but weeks later the question still dogged me. Why attend? Of course, no essay could really put this puzzle to bed. As I discovered over some weekends perusing the literature, uncertainty about the purpose of a college education tends to multiply the further one pursues the matter. To settle any question as subjective as “What is the meaning of college?” almost demands, inT.S. Eliot’s memorable phrase, “a hundred visions and revisions.” Still, as my friends from that strange, mostly happy time would attest, I never met an argument I didn’t like. And one as fraught as whether a Harvard education really is top-notch makes especially good grist for a bookish barroom back-and-forth at the Hong Kong restaurant (my measure of a good time . So, without any real hope of a nice, tidy answer, one possible account might go as follows. In an age ofthinning community commitmentsandpervasive loneliness, a Harvard degree tethers its recipient to a shared past and future through a time-tested transfer of culture between generations. Where this transfer sometimes manifests novel social and cultural uncertainties (W.E.B. Du Bois, Class of 1890,famously lamented“all the irony of my singing ‘Fair Harvard’” as a Black pupil in the College , it also helps to fashion a sense of continuity amid competing research interests, methods, and debates. This sense, ever nourished by a devoted faculty, is the seminal genius of our system, centering a sacred vision of tradition that, in the words of our fair school song, rises calmly “thro’ change and thro’ storm.” All well and good, you say, but isn’t that story a bit rosy? Well, yes — very. Any undergrad could tell you the ways Harvard has changed since the Puritan guarding University Hallsent his first donationin the 1630s (if only he could see the endowment today! . There’s no more chapel requirement, no Indian College, no Massachusetts Bay Colony. Heck, much about Harvard has changed even since the 1930s — or the 1990s, for that matter. (I challenge all able-bodied undergraduates to swim 100 yards at the Malkin Athletic Center before graduation day. True, there have been windows of stability, even of conservative recoil, but I’d be lying if I didn t admit that the academy upon which the Class of ’27, the fourth in our history, is entering is worlds apart from the Harvard of yore. Why then the pleasant fiction about continuity? Well, because that was the Harvard I chose to attend, of course! As an undergraduate, I felt drawn to an idea — a myth, if you like — of tradition across the ages. I sought classes on the early Shakespeare plays, John Milton’s Paradise Lost, and the masterworks of Renaissance polyphony. Iwrote a Crimson columntoying with the notion of cultural continuity amid fast political change. I even stuck around my first two years to sing in the graduation choir (yes, I still love a good mawkish crimson Commencement . That myth hinged in part on solid classroom instruction — anyone who hasn’t taken professor Gordon Teskey’s English 121CG: “Shakespeare after Hamlet” or professor John Stauffer’s English 90FD: “Rhetoric of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass” is sorely missing out — but also on open minds and a willingness to see all aspects of a Harvard education charitably, even gratefully. In other words, not scoffing at the “section kid” with a genuinely heterodox reading of Shakespeare’s Caliban or a tear in his eye for the sorrowful state of Mariano José de Larra’s decadent Spain. Some current undergraduates will no doubt be asking how they too can carve out that older vision of academic life, happily invested in a timeless intellectual inheritance. First, don’t shy away from the greats. Study Shakespeare, Lincoln, the premier novelists, and so on, reading each author charitably to start. Second, as the former Pusey Minister Jonathan Walton advised, be quick to compliment and slow to criticize. Do not refute ideas you could not reconstruct if needed. Finally, think about permanence. What from your experience will survive, and what will not? (I doubt, for instance, there will ever be a Christmas in the Yard without the University Choir’s brilliant service, which I encourage all to witness at least once. Of course, these are only a small handful of ways to make meaning out of a Harvard degree. For those who disagree with my premise entirely — that college is for cultural transmission and not just acquiring skills or gorging on Harvard University Dining Services “red spiced” chicken — perhaps these tactics will seem less appealing. Still, I urge my readers to give them a whirl. You may feel at first that you’ve put your faith in a myth (I did anyway . But that feeling will fade. And then you’ll find yourself a recent graduate, head still halfway full of Shakespeare or Marx or Joseph Conrad, wondering whether it’s worth venturing your partial answer to the eternal question – “Why Harvard?” — for whichever undergraduates might happen to lend an ear. Henry N. Brooks, a former Crimson Opinion columnist, graduated from the College in 2019."
crimson_2023_37,"Allegations of student club theft totaling tens of thousands of dollars. A chaotic push to change the student government. A new, bold Harvard president. No, I’m not talking about the past two years at Harvard, although these events all occurred recently too. I’m talking about Harvard more than two decades ago, as described in the memoir of Ross G. Douthat ’02: “Privilege: Harvard and the Education of the Ruling Class.” In it, he details these happenings, many of which bear a striking resemblance to the Harvard of today. Mark Twain said history rhymes but does not repeat. He must not have been to Harvard. History seems to recur here, with students and administrators caught in a Nietzschean cycle of eternal return. The very same worries that consume current students (including myself over grade inflation, careerism, and a crisis in the humanities, are also reflected in Douthat’s account of Harvard in the early 2000s. Student sit-ins for higher wages, progressive protests of the Crimson, debates over the core curriculum — does any of this sound familiar? The nouns change, but the verbs stay the same. At first, I wasn’t sure what to make of this parallelism. Is it depressing or comforting that we are encountering the same struggles as past students? For his part, Douthat interprets the repetition of student activism as a vindication of his conservative worldview. He argues that liberal students are never happy with their hard-fought victories and continually agitate for ever-more ludicrous demands. For example, as a student, Douthat was struck by student activists who, upon helping to win a $11.35 hourly wage for janitorial staff, immediately pivoted to demands for $14.00 an hour. Now in 2023, students are pushing for a $23.45 hourly wage. Douthat would, no doubt, look at current protests as a comical extension of past demands taken to their logical extremes. In a 2005 Crimson opinion piece, current Republican presidential candidate Vivek G. Ramaswamy ’07 exhibited the same conservative denigration of perennial protests for a living wage. That historical reading, though, misses the point. Ramaswamy and Douthat are correct that campus activism is cyclical and dialectical: Student demands yield administration concessions which yield further demands. But that does not render such activism meaningless. One could just as easily read the increase in union wage demands as the arc of history gradually bending towards justice. Instead of being absurd, student protests continuously pass along a virtuous cause that will rightfully continue into the future. The repetition of the story is a reason to agitate for change, not a reason to abandon it. Underlying that insight is a lesson about Harvard more generally. Coming to college, I thought a university as old as ours would have most things figured out by now. Of course, I didn’t expect everything to be perfect, but I assumed imperfections would be scrutinized and changed over time. I now know that not to be the case. In higher education, broken systems can remain broken for a long time, despite public awareness of a problem. As far back as 2005, Douthat was sounding the alarm about the overrepresentation of the wealthy at Harvard, but our university remains economically homogeneous. It turns out that incisive criticism alone often doesn’t resolve intractable problems like grade inflation or excessive careerism. These problems have existed for two decades and may continue for two decades to come. To some, this scleroticism might vindicate the conservative criticism of universities as overly bureaucratic. But even Douthat and Ramaswamy clearly have some fundamental optimism about Harvard’s capacity to change: They deemed it worth their time to publicly criticize the University in these very pages. Though their methods differ, it seems to me that the two conservatives and student protesters agree on one thing: Harvard is responsive to criticism given time. I can’t help but agree, having spent hundreds of hours writing about how Harvard and higher education can be improved. No matter how much Harvard’s history may encourage fatalism, we students can’t help but think about how our school can be better. Sometimes those ideas translate into direct improvements like raises for graduate student workers or ethnic studies cluster hires. More often, they don’t. But the lack of a clear relationship between criticism of Harvard and change shouldn’t be an excuse for nihilism. While admissions are still dominated by the wealthy, financial aid is more generous than ever. Yes, consulting and finance dominate post graduate professional recruiting, butHarvard clubsand institutionsare gradually diversifying employment options. Pressing problems persist, but the contours of the discourse have changed. Douthat ends his book by saying we should love Harvard “not because it is good (it is not but because there is good in it, and things worth fighting for.” With that in mind, I will continue to write, students will continue to protest, and Douthat and Ramaswamy will continue to criticize. To all of that, I say, keep it up! It may be a cycle, but it gets a tiny bit better with each spin. Aden Barton ’24, an Associate Editorial Editor, is an Economics concentrator in Eliot House."
rice_thresher_2023_38,"ByNayeli Shad4/18/23 10:08pm When I came into this job, the Thresher was learning how to do journalism in a pandemic. We couldn’t anticipate how the paper would look like if and when we returned to “normal.” The once-jam-packed opinion spread had been reduced to a single page that wasn’t always filled. As engagement with and trust of the opinion section has ebbed and flowed in the three years since then, one thing has remained constant: to uplift diverse voices and start important discussions on campus, we have to wield the platform carefully. As a journalist and the arbiter of the section most devoted to the First Amendment, I have to give every voice a chance to speak. The only way to open a platform for some people is to do so for all — though not without limits. Deciding what free speech we allow is a tricky line to walk each week. I have made my fair share of mistakes over the years — there were statements I failed to fully fact check, claims that were solely inflammatory and pieces that needed more consideration before publishing — but it is through accountability that the section progresses. We have faced our fair share of criticism for the things we publish, but this discourse is a necessary part of the process. I have learned to separate myself from the noise and focus on valid critiques that can strengthen our paper. Above all, I work hard to put out the best versions of our opinions, because people are listening. Despite the challenges, what has kept me going is knowing that the work we do matters. Seeing changes todining plansanddiscussionsaroundChatGPToccur because of what was published on page five of the paper reminds me why the section exists. For every controversial opinion designed to stir up criticism, there are many more that can achieve change. As I put out my first (and last two-page spread filled with discourse as opinion editor, I am confident I will see the section flourish from a close distance as managing editor — so long as the Rice community values its potential. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

Dear Stanford Community, We are current and former members of the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB, or Band , some of whom have been involved with Band leadership dating back several years. A few days ago, the ASSU received aresolutionto certify an annual grant for the LSJUMB, which would provide the organization with funding from the general student body. As noted in the resolution’s preamble, the Joint By-Laws of the ASSU state that in order to apply for such funding, the LSJUMB must be certified by the relevant ASSU bodies as meeting the standard that “the organization and its finances are in fact essentially under the control of students.” It is with regret that we write this letter detailing the many ways in which the LSJUMB has failed to meet this standard in recent years, constituting a breach of applicable ASSU and Office of Student Engagement (OSE policies.In light of the reality described below, we advocate for the LSJUMB’s request for annual grant certification be denied. By sharing our views and experiences in a public forum, we hope to not only affect change in Band, but to prompt wider discussions on the role of student autonomy and wellbeing on campus. A fundamental marker of an organization being “under the control of students” is the right of student membership to select their own leaders. The OSE includes this expectation among itsCore 10 Student Org Policies: “leaders must be chosen by election, consensus or another democratic selection process, by the organization’s membership every year, in accordance with the organization’s constitution.” Prior to 2020, this was indeed the case for the LSJUMB. The pandemic, however, brought a period of aggressive restructuring. Over the several years, we witnessed decisions be primarily dictated by Band director Dr. Russell Gavin, in direct opposition to LSJUMB student opinion. A handful of the innumerable, devastating changes to the LSJUMB are detailed later in this letter, with a particularly egregious change being the abolition of student-selected leadership. When the Band’s governing documents were redrafted in 2020 with heavy influence from Dr. Gavin, specifics of how the Band’s Executive Team — the organization’s highest-ranking officers — would be selected were left out of theStructural Charter. The document simply mentions that the selection process “will include an interview with the director.” Nowhere is any mechanism of selection outlined. The OSE requires that such a mechanism be enshrined in the LSJUMB’s constitution, and that it must be “democratic” and involve “the organization’s membership.” When concerns about this oversight were reasonably raised in 2020, LSJUMB members were reassured that these details would be added at a later time. Three years later, they have yet to be added. As a result,every member of the Band’s incumbent Executive Committee was hand-picked by the director and not the organization’s membership, as confirmed by current members of Band student leadership. This includes the Treasurer. We maintain that student leaders and Treasurers, if appointed by the director to rubber-stamp organizational and financial decisions that are ultimately dictated by the director themself, do not constitute evidence of the “organization and its finances” being “essentially under the control of students,” as required for Band to be eligible for ASSU annual grant funding. The undemocratic nature of the LSJUMB is further evidenced by a number of concerning incidents occurring over the past 12 months. During a town hall meeting held in the spring of 2022, which several of us attended, members of the Executive Committee were challenged by students to name a single decision made that academic year via a vote by the student staff team. They failed to produce an answer. Around the same time, members of the Band recognized the concerning fact that the new structure of the organization offered no way to hold our director accountable. In desperation, members of the Band drafted aletterto the Deputy Athletics Director, who supervises the director of the Band, pleading for support in holding the director accountable. This letter was signed by 39 students: a majority of Band’s membership at the time. An investigation was carried out by the Athletics Department, but any outcomes or conclusions were not communicated to students. Finally, one particularly outrageous display of the director’s authoritarianism occurred during a conversation between a student staff member and the director. In response to the staff member suggesting to the director that a particular governance issue be resolved via a vote by student leadership, the director warned the student not to say “the V-Word” ever again. The V-word in question? “Vote.” The restructuring of Band in 2020 led to a number of changes instituted unilaterally by the director and in direct opposition to popular student opinion. Notably,these changes to theBand’s governing documentsgave the director ultimate control over aspects of Band life and culture that were previously under the discretion of student leadership, and which are in fact under the discretion of student leadership in virtually every other student organization on campus. This directly contradicts the claim made in the preamble of the ASSU resolution in question that “under the new structure of the Band, student leadership shall retain the many decision-making responsibilities that they previously held.” Using this newfound power, the director has forbidden the Band from performing certain songs, transformed our on-campus home from a safe space rich with history and joy to nothing more than a rehearsal space, instituted punitive restrictions on how we express ourselves, and even on how we can speak. Furthermore, all Band social events are tightlyrestricted, with events as benign as section lunches and game nights requiring prior approval. The list of such intrusive and arbitrary policies is endless, but as a final illustrative example, we direct you to the Band’snickname policy, which stipulates that all nicknames given to Band members must first be personally approved by the director. We believe these details sufficiently refute the claim that the LSJUMB, its governance, and its finances are “essentially under the control of students.” The technical argument, however, pales in importance to the following, more fundamental concern: over the past three years, the LSJUMB has utterly failed to serve its students and prioritize their happiness and wellbeing, and has instead burdened its rapidly dwindling membership with severe emotional distress. As it became increasingly clear to members of the Band that leadership had no interest in prioritizing student wellbeing, scores of once-dedicated LSJUMBers departed the organization in search of community and joy elsewhere on campus. Whereas the Band once boasted close to 100 members on the field at every football game, it had fewer than 40 members in attendance on three separate occasions during the 2022 football season. Annual trips to the Pac-12 Basketball Tournaments in previous years typically saw members clamoring for one of the coveted 55 spots available to the Band. Last week, fewer than 35 students made the trip to Vegas. The few who remain today find themselves in a suffocatingly toxic environment. In the last two cohorts of Band staff, several members have been suspended by the director on questionable grounds, while others have quit after months of torment. Many of the remaining staff members have already begun asking themselves how much more they are willing to take. The irony of the whole situation is that the express goal of the structural changes carried out in 2020 was to eliminate the toxic and problematic aspects of the Band that have plagued it for years. What began as determination to make positive change to the culture of our organization in an effort to make it healthier and more welcoming has devolved into an utterly avoidable source of pain and frustration for dozens of students. For the sake of future generations of the LSJUMB and the wider Stanford community, the Band cannot be allowed to continue to harm its members. The resolution in question asks the ASSU to assert that “the LSJUMB and its finances are “essentially” under the control of students.” We believe we have provided sufficient evidence that this is far from the case. The director and other proponents of the Band’s departure from student-based governance will suggest that this transfer of authority was necessary in order to address the Band’s problematic culture. In their eyes, a student-run organization is necessarily less safe, accessible, and positive than a university-run one. Not only is this terribly condescending, it is patently untrue. The evidence is all around campus. A capella groups have total say over what songs they perform. Dance groups are allowed to decide when and where to meet for lunch. Members of intramural sports teams do not need to get permission from their coaches to call each other nicknames. In other words, students are free to make their own decisions in every other student group on campus. The outcome? Flourishing communities that are the highlight of their members’ Stanford careers. Compare these communities to the Band today and it becomes clear that its abysmal state is a direct consequence of the disempowerment and silencing of students in the LSJUMB. Before the Band can once again provide its members with the profoundly meaningful experience it once did, serious efforts must be made towards ensuring its students’ right to self-govern. The constitution must be modified to include a democratic, student-controlled selection process for Executive Team members. Safeguards must be put in place to guarantee that the constitution is enforced, and that it cannot be overridden by the Band director. The long journey of rebuilding the Band must begin with a return to genuine student leadership. Until this crucial step is taken, however, we do not believe that the LSJUMB is deserving of funding from the student body. This year marks the 60th anniversary of The Revolution; the birth of the LSJUMB as we know — or knew — it. In 1963, Band members went on strike, demanding that they be given the right to self-govern. The rest is a long history of satire, stunts, and making people smile at Stanford, in the Bay, andaround the world. It is those very principles of self-governance and agency that the Band was founded on that allowed generations of Band members to revel in self-expression, explore their identities, challenge themselves, come to understand their sexuality, find community (and sometimes love , and ultimately learn to become the person they needed to become. These facets of the LSJUMB can and must exist independent of the Band’s problematic past, but they can only exist under student leadership. So long as the Band continues to neglect student agency and wellbeing, we believe it should not be entitled to funding from the student body. As such, we humbly advocate that the ASSU deny the LSJUMB’s request for annual grant certification until such a time that student interests are once again prioritized. Thank you.

crimson_2023_124,"Harvard students are rarely asked why they chose Harvard. For many people, it’s circular. They went to Harvard because it’s Harvard. Ours is a school so often synonymous with success and academic excellence that its name is used as shorthand. Social media is flooded with clickbait videos and articles with titles like “Tricky riddle that ’97 per cent of Harvard grads cannot solve’ leaves people baffled – so can YOU figure out the answer?” Getting into Harvard, for many students, makes the choice pretty easy. I think a lot about why I’m here. Like many current undergraduates, I never imagined myself at Harvard. I remember walking around the campus in October 2021 in utter amazement of the historic, beautiful brick buildings lining the Yard, especially the majesty of Widener Library. My mom, nervous that I would get my hopes up, tried tempering me as much as she could. I could feel the anxiety radiating from her, worried that I would get my heart broken by a rejection letter. My grandparents, too, would send me article after article deriding the prestigious and uninviting culture of Ivy League schools. At the time, I didn’t take their concerns personally. Visiting Harvard felt like visiting the U.S. Congress or walking down the Freedom Trail. Sure, it was beautiful, but it wasn’t mine. It was a part of history, of American culture, of which I was merely getting a survey. That’s perhaps what made Visitas so jarring — that I was visiting a place again, only months later, in a different context. Whereas I was an observer before, this time I was a participant. Most of my now-friends talk about their Visitas experience as joyous. They recount with small smiles their stories of meeting people they immediately became friends with. They talk about staying up with their hosts, learning about Harvard and what it was like to be a student. For me, Visitas was distinctly less positive. I remember how engaged I felt listening to the handful of lectures I attended and again being in awe of the beautiful buildings, this time seeing the inside of Memorial Hall and Sanders Theatre. But I also felt distinctly alone. I made no instant connections with anybody. Conversations I had were shallow and fleeting, and I honestly couldn’t tell you the name of anybody I met during that weekend. It seemed as though everyone already had their cliques. I was so completely lost. I was surrounded by people sure of their futures. They had already committed to coming here, and they knew exactly what they were going to study. They seemed comfortable. I didn’t know what I was doing or what I was supposed to be doing. I walked away from Visitas confused. I left with more questions than answers, and no closer to knowing where I should go. In fact, after Visitas I felt even more divided between my final two choices, Harvard and Columbia University (a school I had dreamed of going to for the prior six years . But I chose Harvard. I still don’t know why exactly. I can give you the answers I used to justify it to myself at the time: the job security that comes along with a Harvard degree, the fact that Cambridge would have been an easier transition from rural Colorado compared to Manhattan, the realization that I liked the campus more. But really, it came down to a gut feeling I had. A sense that choosing Harvard was the right decision. I try not to look back at that decision much, because it’s a decision that I can’t unmake. But everytime I call my mom, she asks me the same question. “Do you regret choosing Harvard?” And every time I answer the same way. “No.” There are a lot of reasons I shouldn’t belong at Harvard. I’m not wealthy. Neither of my parents went to Ivy League schools (although they both are incredibly smart . I didn’t spend my high school years obsessing over my grades. I come from a rural, isolated part of the American West. I think a lot of those things are what made Visitas feel the way it did for me — why I felt isolated and lonely. These days, as a full-fledged Harvard student, I only sometimes feel that way. But for every night I’ve been overwhelmed by schoolwork, or felt deeply lonely, I’ve spent an equal amount of time laughing and talking for hours with friends, or genuinely enjoying a lecture, or feeling engaged in a discussion section. I’ve spent hours in rehearsal for some new play or musical, at home with people who feel like my people. At Harvard, I’ve found my place. I’ve found people that I love, and people who appreciate me. I’ve found work, both inside and outside of class, that I find immensely fulfilling. I’ve found a home for myself at Harvard. I know there are prospective Harvard students who will feel the same way I did during Visitas: who will feel alone and scared, who will feel that they do not belong. I urge you, if you are feeling that way, to not let it linger. You are sure to go through periods of feeling blue while you are at Harvard. But as you spend more time here, and you find the niches in which you belong, you will find a home. You will find people who respect and appreciate and love you. If you put in the work, you can find a place here in Cambridge — where you belong. Vander O. B. Ritchie ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Matthews Hall."
ubyssey_2023_24,"April 14, 2023 Written byUbyssey Editorial Board In September2022, members ofThe Ubysseytook to the streets to ask people how to pronounce our name. And only a handful got it right. We get it. We have 11 editors, over 200 contributors and 70 staff writers, and at one point or another, we’ve all asked ourselves “How do you pronounceThe Ubyssey?” Other student paper’s names are pretty self-explanatory. Many have the name of their school or mention a mascot — takeTheMcGill DailyorThe Varsityas examples. But, not us. Our paper’s name is a play onThe Odyssey. And because of that, our paper is calledThe Ubyssey. So we’re setting the record straight.The Ubysseyisn’t pronouncedyou-bee-see,you-bye-seeoryou-bussy. It’sYOU-bih-see.Ubyssey. But why? The Ubysseywas established in 1918, after two years of printingThe Ubicee— which wasn’t a full newspaper, instead it was a single three-columned page of text. The first editorial renamedUbiceetoUbyssey, taking inspiration fromThe Odyssey. Why? We don’t know. We weren’t alive. But the editors of volume five were. And theywrotethat “the ‘Ubicee’ was destined to become the ‘Odyssey’ of the University,” hence the 1918 name change and the creation of the full newspaper we have today —The Ubyssey. IfThe Ubysseyis supposed to be theOdysseyof UBC, what isThe Odyssey? Are we actually the Odyssey of our school? Let’s break this down. According to Wikipedia (we love your work ,The Odysseyis one of two major ancient Greek epics written by Homer — no, not the guy fromThe Simpsons, it’s this random Greek guy considered one of the most influential authors in history. It follows a warrior named Odysseus and his journey back home after the Trojan War. After the war, people thought Odysseus was dead, so his wife, Penelope, was going to get remarried. We can’t speak on behalf of past editorials on if their wives had plans to get remarried, but no one on our board has experienced this. But, we have experienced being an epic student paper. This past year alone, we were nominated for16 national student journalism awards(and won 9 of them , we publisheduniversitynews,deep-divesinto policyissues at UBC, coveredartsandculture,sports andathletesandscienceandresearch, we publishedstudentopinionsandjokes, all whiletakingphotosandmakingvideosanddesigns.

rice_thresher_2023_0,"ByThresher Editorial Board1/24/23 10:13pm At the very first Editorial Board meeting of this school year, the seniors on our board got on our high horses to inform the Rice community of the way things used to be done vis-a-vis selling tickets to public parties. We’ve held our tongues since then, as we can appreciate that circumstances change and growth is good. But the time has come for us to speak again, this time in support of resurrecting the greatest of all pre-COVID traditions: Sunday brunch. Picture this: you wake up on Sunday morning with a slight headache (who knows why . You shuffle out of your room towards the servery, and what do you find? An omelet bar, homemade tortillas and the smell of little caramelized waffles wafting toward you. This used to be a weekly occurrence, and oh boy, was it magical. Recapping the previous night’s events over smoothies, funfetti pancakes and chilaquiles was the pinnacle of every week. To be clear, we are in no way critiquing the removal of this marvelous experience. COVID-19 precautions called for spreading out mealtime attendance in serveries to the fullest extent possible, and brunch was combining the attendance of two meals into one. But for the life of us, we cannot think of a good reason why Sunday brunch cannot or should not now return to our serveries. So to David McDonald, or whomever it is at Housing & Dining that decides the meal schedule, we humbly request on behalf of the student body that Sunday brunch be returned expeditiously. For one thing, it will temporarily subdue students’ anger at their lack of HBO Max access. For another, it’s just the right thing to do. If nothing else, do it for the Texas-shaped waffles.

April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25.

crimson_2023_60,"Since their appearances before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, and MIT have been subject to abarrage of hostile criticismin the media, including from constitutional scholars known for their advocacy for free speech. When asked whether they would discipline students (or, I suppose, faculty if they called for the genocide of Jews, each president responded that the answer depends on the context of the utterances. I have taught at Harvard Law School since 1961 and began practicing before the Supreme Court in 1985 — for four years as Solicitor General of the United States — and I would have felt professionally obligated to answer as the presidents did. It does depend on the context. In the 1969 case Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that “constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or prescribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. Now, many — perhaps most — constitutional democracies do not go this far, and courts in some nations, including Canada, France, Germany, and South Africa, have allowed criminal prosecution for what may compendiously be called hate speech. But our Supreme Court has never deviated from its principle of incitement. Even in the case that strayed the furthest from this standard — the 2010 decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, which upheld the statute that makes it a federal crime to knowingly provide “material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization” — Chief Justice John Roberts ’76 was careful to carve out free speech from the ruling. In that decision, he wrote that, under the statute, Americans “may say anything they wish on any topic” so long as they do not speak or write “to, under the direction of, or in coordination with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.” The three dissenters would have gone further in protecting the organizations’ speech. To be clear, governments may withhold benefits from American members of foreign terrorist organizations under certain circumstances, and certainly governments may declare official positions condemning such organizations and their principles. But none of this includes criminal sanctions. Speech itself is, indeed, well-protected. The three university presidents head private institutions that are not bound in every respect by federal constitutional constraints. But each institution in various ways has declared itself committed to protecting First Amendment values over the years. So it is not surprising that their presidents would have answered that whether they would discipline or expel students for advocating genocide depends on the context. If one seeks to follow constitutional principles, answering this question certainly does depend on the context. In 1991, prompted by an incident in which Harvard students hung Confederate flags outside their dorm windows, University President Derek C. Bok penned an essay defending the rights of the students to display offensive messages. He directly linked Harvard’s free speech guidelines to First Amendment principles, writing that he had “difficulty understanding why a university such as Harvard should have less free speech than the surrounding society—or than a public university.” I must admit that I have never seen such flags in recent times. Yet, even today, under the circumstances Bok faced, if I were a university president pressed to answer yes or no whether the student speech in question would subject the students to discipline, I would have to reply that, yes, it depends on the context. The lead questioner, Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06, sought to lay a rhetorical trap for the three university presidents. But I doubt Stefanik is as principled as she purports to be. Were the facts of the event before President Bok 30 years ago to recur and the administration to fail to discipline the display of Confederate flags, would Representative Stefanik have had the same reaction? I doubt it. Charles Fried is the Beneficial Professor of Law at Harvard Law School."

The UBC Senate is one of the highest governing bodies of the university, alongside the Board of Governors. While the latter focuses on financial matters, the Senate focuses on academic governance. Academic calendar dates? Senate. New courses and syllabi? Senate. Finalizing your graduation? You guessed it, Senate does that too! Both the Senate and the Board of Governors operate on a triennial system — this means the bodies operate on three-year long cycles. The majority of senators and governors (with the exception of students serve three-year long terms, and committees tend to take on long term projects over a period of three years. Toward the end of each triennium, the Senate undergoes a triennial review, seeking outfeedbackfrom all senators and the wider UBC community to inform how work is done within Senate committees and in the Senate more broadly.

crimson_2023_132,"When I moved into my Harvard University Housing residence last summer, I had to furnish an entire apartment for a family of four. I would only use the apartment for 11 months. My strategy was to try to live as minimally and cost-efficiently as possible, which meant regressing to college-style sleeping on a mattress and drinking from containers not meant for beverages. In the dead of the summer humidity, I dragged downstairs a poorly-made secondhand table by myself and spotted a neighbor similarly battling a mattress to the curb all on her own. The number of furniture items casually abandoned on the streets of Boston and Cambridge during move-in and move-out season is a novelty for newcomers. Neighbors call it “Allston Christmas.” Many items seem to get picked up, but many others still end up in landfills. We have all heard of ‘fast fashion’ and the negative impacts this kind of consumerism has on the environment, but it seems that there’s a culture of ‘fast furniture’ here as well. This collective annual repetitive waste is a disaster for the environment, and universities should take action to prevent it. Harvard University Housing provides approximately 3,000 units of housing to graduate students, faculty, and staff. But currently,only around 250 of these unitscan be identified as furnished. Most units require occupants to acquire furniture when they move in and dispose of it when they leave. Approximately 50 percent of the units turn over each year, which means this phenomenally wasteful practice of fast furniture can be repeated regularly. Producing the average piece of furniture generates 47 kilograms of carbon dioxide — the equivalent of burning approximately 5.3 gallons of petrol. One of the worst offenders is the mattress, whose foam material is conventionally made of nonrenewable virgin fossil fuels. Producing one full-size mattress costs approximately 79 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions, and according to IKEA, only 13 percent of the foam can be recycled. If each savvy renter buys just one mattress and one other piece of furniture during their transient stay in Cambridge (an optimistic assumption , that would result in 126 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions. This is the equivalent of powering 77.1 gasoline-powered vehicles a year for the total approximate 2,750 unfurnished units of housing. The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference’s commitment to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require us to reduce emissions globally by 43 percent by 2030. But simply attending my one-year program at the Harvard Kennedy School has increased my share of emissions more than reducing it. To be fair, the city of Cambridge overall does a fairly good job of diverting and recycling waste. Many lucky renters inherit free items by simply walking around during Allston Christmas. Harvard’s Recycling and Surplus Center provides free, used University furniture, and there are free service organizations that arrange for group furniture donation pickups. There are also various informal and formal private marketplaces to upcycle secondhand. But this obvious strategy is frustrated by the time and cost burden placed on students. The leakage in refurnishing rental units is not absolute in every situation, but simply seeing the items left on the streets of Cambridge and Boston will affirm that there’s room for improvement. Too many graduate students take the path of least resistance. Facing limited time, logistic, physical, donation, and priority restrictions, many of us — particularly families — buy far more than a few mattresses. Aside from environmental impacts, the amount of money, stress, and time this pattern of fast furniture generates is frustrating and unnecessary. Rather than contributing to fast furniture, Harvard University Housing should increase the number of furnished units, providing students with basic pieces of furniture such as beds, desks, tables, and chairs (which every student needs — similar to what undergraduates receive. Not only would providing (partially furnished units lift the unnecessary and regressive burden of furnishing units from students, but it would also be more in keeping with Harvard’sown sustainability goalto reduce greenhouse gas emissions by “the maximum practicable rate.” Harvard University Housing has said that the number of furnished units they provide will likely not change over time. Is the current low percent of furnished housing really the maximum practicable rate? As I get ready to leave Harvard at the end of the spring term, it’s time to figure out what to do with the fast furniture and household goods I myself bought less than a year ago. Some of the items are so poorly made that I’ll probably have to pay someone to take them to the dumpster by June 31 when my lease expires. And when July rolls around, there will be a new crop of graduate students who will face the same dilemma and hassle all over again. Until Harvard University Housing decides to address the climate impact of furniture waste systematically, it is up to each of us to consume less to stop the planet from overheating: one mattress at a time.

wildcat_arizona_2023_14,"“ArtificialIntelligence (AI can potentially pose a threat to academic integrity if it is used to create or generate academic work that is meant to be passed off as original, human-generated content. This is known as ‘contract cheating,’ where students use AI tools to write essays or complete other coursework. However, the use of AI tools also has the potential to detect and prevent academic misconduct by flagging instances of plagiarism and other forms of cheating. Overall, it depends on how AI is being used, but it can both pose a threat and also help to promote academic integrity.” Interestingly enough, the entire first paragraph was copied and pasted from an AI chatbot called ChatGPT when I asked it, “Is AI a threat to academic integrity?” Thischatbotwas created by an artificial intelligence company called OpenAI, and it is known for being able to communicate with adequate human language styles and provide information. Its ability to create in-depth sentences opens up an opportunity for students to copy the information it gives them on essays and other assignments, which could be potentially problematic. Since the answers ChatGPT gives its users are entirely original, this form of plagiarism would not be detected by sites like Turnitin. However, the chatbot does not provide longer overall responses, as most answer lengths are around aparagraph. The information is also fact-based, and students would struggle using its answers to form an argument for certain opinion-based papers. So, this type of artificial intelligence is not going to be ending creative essays or opinion writing anytime soon. Though, this type of factual information may pose a threat to journalists and threaten trustworthy sources. With its ability to answer user questions and provide factual information, news reporting journalism may be at risk. Similarly, this technology may be used to create convincingfakenews stories that sound like they have been generated by real journalists and human writers.

ChatGPT can explain complicated topics without requiring users tofilterthrough unrelated and unnecessary sources like on Google. This type of technological progression may be beneficial for those seeking quick information without the annoyance of search engines, but is it worth the potential risks? I think the answer comes down to what the AI said itself, that it largely depends on how it is being used. Technological progression is both convenient and helpful, so ChatGPT isn’t necessarily a bad thing. However, if it is being used to promote false information and simultaneously brings an end to news journalism, the way we receive information may completely change in the future.

ubyssey_2023_0,"Dec. 19, 2023 Written byAlyy Patel Sonali (Alyy Patel is the Executive Director of the Queer South Asian Women’s Network, author of “Don’t Tell My Parents: Queer Diasporic Truths,” and a PhD Student in Sociology at the University of British Columbia. The start of December marks an exhilarating yet anxiety-ridden time of year. As a Queer South Asian woman who is not out to my family, there are three things that I can expect this month. First, at least one person — if not more — will offer unsolicited advice to come out to my family and insist that my parents will love me anyway (fun fact: they will not . Second, my family will consistently remind me that I need to find a nice boy to marry. They will also probably ask me why my obviously masculine-presenting girlfriend has not found a man yet. Out of love and concern, of course. And third, somebody will make the cringe see you next year Dad joke on December 31. Much to everybody s surprise, I m not mad that my family cannot accept me. I understand. However, I am deeply disappointed by how many people feel compelled to pressure me to come out without understanding the culturally unique consequences of doing so. And this isn t an isolated experience. For a recent research study, I interviewed forty queer South Asian women across Canada about their experiences of navigating the closet and found a very consistent narrative. Here is what they told me: Queer South Asian women in Canadafaceconflicting cultural expectations.On one hand, there are expectations from one s ethnic community to remain closeted. Since an individual’s actions reflect the collective integrity of the family unit in South Asian culture, coming out as non-heterosexual threatens to damage the entire family’s reputation. This means it will incite merciless gossip and risk parental ties with their extended relatives. To protect their family from this pain, Queer South Asian women must remain closeted. On the other hand, there are expectations from the 2SLGBTQIA+ community to come out and leave behind any family members who do not accept their sexuality. This set of expectations fails to consider the culturally unique consequences and barriers that impede the ability of queer South Asian to do so. Nevertheless, the latter is associated with a notion of living your truth, while the former is seen as living a lie. However, for many queer South Asian women, being in the closetishow they live their truth. It allows them to safely engage in queer spaces and relationshipsandfamily and ethnic community without giving up one for the other. Despite the fact that being in the closet allows queer South Asian women to embrace both their sexual and ethnic identities, LGBTQ+ people and allies often recommend severing ties with unaccepting family members. While they may have good intentions for doing so, it constitutes a form of micro-aggressive violence — and more concerningly, it is deeply exhausting for queer South Asian women to experience regularly. Ambika (a pseudonym described her experience of being micro-aggressed by her white queer colleague at a 2SLGBTQIA+ organization: “My co-worker in training basically said like, ‘maybe you just don’t try hard enough to be out. You need to be more overtly out.’ ... They basically pinned it on me and were like, ‘It’s on you if family don’t get it and screw them.’ And I was like, ... that’s not the way family works – not the way I was raised, at least. It was weird to get that pushback from a co-worker to be like, ‘you’re not out enough.’ And I was like yeah, I’m trying, trust me, but this is as out as I will be.” For many queer South Asian women, coming out to parents is not as simple as telling them and then severing ties if they are unaccepting. Durga (a pseudonym explained to me how deviating from expectations of being in the closet leads to violence: “In South Asian families, if your parents don t accept your sexuality, then they won t necessarily kick you out or cut off ties either because that would incite gossip. … So then, family rejection literally means violence. … If they don t like that you re gay, they will be violent and abusive until you do what they say.” It is an unfortunate reality that many queer South Asian women in Canada whose parents suspect or learn of their queerness become subjected to emotional, verbal, physical and financial abuse. The most prevalent form is emotional violence, which includes guilt-inducing comments, such as, We did so much for you; how could you do this to us?; You are so selfish, you re not thinking about anyone else; Don t come to our funeral; and Do you want us to die?, as well as threats to commit suicide if their child continues to be queer, which was commonly said by South Asian mothers. The women I spoke to also described experiences of physical violence, such as slapping, hitting and choking, which were inflicted in an attempt to repress queer tendencies. These are a few of the consequences that may arise from coming out in South Asian families. I do not intend to suggest that all South Asian families are violent and/or unaccepting of their queer children. In fact, there are several South Asian families that accept and unconditionally love their 2SLGBTQIA+ children. For example,Nidhi Shukla,LavinaandAnjali Chakrato name a few. However, the violence is also a reality for many. The fact that queer South Asian women’s experiences are severely underrepresented in media, research and communities allows micro-aggressions against them to continue, and even become normalized. Hence, many do not see how they are perpetuating harm by telling queer South Asians to come out to their parents, when in fact, coming out can be deeply dangerous. As we prepare to see our families this holiday season, I have some tips for engaging with your 2SLGBTQIA+ peers: The simple solution here might be to drink your eggnog and mind your own business. But in all seriousness, being queer and South Asian is hard enough as it is. It would be a holiday wish come true if our peers could support those of us who want to exist as queer people without coming out to our parents. If you, or a gender-marginalized 2SLGBTQIA+ South Asian person you know, are seeking chosen family this holiday season, I recommend checking out thevirtual eventshosted by the Queer South Asian Women’s Network. Author s Note: The inability of many parents to accept their queer children, as well as the various forms of family violence, are a product of the colonial erasure of queerness in South Asian culture.

crimson_2023_99,"The idea for this piece came to me on a run. It wasn’t even really a run, more of a half-run, half-walk situation that would have made me very embarrassed a year ago. My pace was slow, and I had a heavy coat on that was weighing me down — mainly because I had intended it to be a walk before I got bored and started running. It wasn’t anything impressive, certainly not something that would make someone think that I was one of the captains of my track team in high school. But I was, and yet when I exercise now it often looks like this. Many of us here are ex-athletes. Always overachieving and searching for the next organization to join, we were led into sports, and many of us were good at them, too. We were captains and team leaders, we led teams to championships, and we competed at regional, state, and even national levels. We devoted countless hours to our teams, committing hours almost every day of the week to practice. It was rewarding to see ourselves become so physically skilled: so fast, so strong, so agile. But now we’re in college, and that’s gone — not for all of us, but for the vast majority. With a new schedule, new clubs we feel compelled to join, and no threat of a yelling coach, it s easy to put exercise first on the chopping block. There’s a certain shame in not working out as much as you used to, not being guaranteed a worked-up sweat everyday to make you feel good about yourself. In high school, physical exhaustion was a symbol of accomplishment, and aching muscles were a source of pride. A lot of us lack that now. With such a routine source of achievement gone, it s easy to feel ashamed, or at least a little lost. It’s difficult to realize that you can’t do as many pull-ups, or that you can’t run that six-minute mile you ran a year ago, or that you can’t do nearly as many consecutive backflips. It hurts to no longer see yourself as stereotypically physically fit, despite those standards being largely unattainable. I’m not stubborn enough to try to fight against the fact that exercise is good for you. But demanding exercise isn’t the only way to be happy, and it’s also not the only way to take care of your physical health. It often seems like the end-all be-all, and after years of running I often struggle to accept it myself. It wasn’t healthy to define myself by how fast I could run a lap around the track. It definitely wasn’t good to see how long I could last before practicing the hurdles got a little too dangerous because of exhaustion. Looking back, it was stupid to still try to practice when injured, and to feel bad when I missed even one workout. What I thought was so healthy couldn’t have been any less. So now I try to remember the other aspects of health besides physical fitness. It’s good to focus on how friendships can lengthen your lifespan, how spending time outdoors lessens anxiety and muscle tension, and how eating a variety of foods gives you nutrients you otherwise would have missed. I open my windows when it’s not too cold out and my water bottle is always being refilled. I still enjoy exercise, but I’m glad it’s no longer the only factor I value in determining my health. So instead of wallowing about your past athletic days, as I so frequently did at the beginning of my freshman year, experience the seasons that Cambridge offers outdoors. Seek out new and old friends to simply be around — even call it networking if that motivates you. Try new foods, and if you ever just feel like walking, feel good about it. I’ll continue to go on my unplanned half-runs, half-walks, where my legs don’t hurt incessantly and I have the energy to enjoy my surroundings. I’ll keep enjoying jogging alongside the Charles river and taking pictures on top of the many bridges that span it. These days, I know that that’s good enough. April S.

stanforddaily_2023_56,"On April 26, in a letter to the community, former President Marc Tessier-Lavigne and former provost Persis Drellwroteto graduate workers in explanation of why the administration refused to voluntarily recognize the Stanford Graduate Workers Union (SGWU after a supermajority of us signed authorization cards signaling interest in forming a union: “We believe that a secret-ballot election is a fundamental principle of democratic decision-making and is the most inclusive, fair and secure method by which to determine whether a majority of eligible graduate students wish to be represented by a union. We feel strongly that every graduate student should have the ability, free from undue influence, to make this decision on their own.” Every graduate studentexceptroughly 33% of us who are funded by fellowships, based on estimates from voter data provided to organizers by the University. In negotiations with the SGWU in preparation for the subsequent election, the Stanford administration refused to agree to allow fellows to participate in spite of the union’s push to include them. Of the5000graduate student-workers at Stanford, only3400were allowed to vote. After ignoring the evident interest of a supermajority of graduate workers in the name of “democracy,” the administration proceeded to disenfranchise a third of the electorate. The Stanford administration is not interested in inclusive or fair democratic decision-making for graduate workers. They have made this clear before the unionization campaign, as they consistentlyignoredand disrespected our elected representatives on the Graduate Student Council. They have reiterated this antagonism to our interests as they moved to split our membership. They tell us that they are trying to promote our democratic will, but the exclusion of fellows from our bargaining unit is a clear effort to limit the power of our union (seeunion busting . Fewer workers in our membership means less power to bargain collectively for the interests of all graduate workers. Stanford’s move to exclude fellows from union representation follows on theexampleof anumberof private universities. The general logic behind the exclusion is that because of fellows’ distinct funding arrangement, they do not fall into the traditional labor relationship where compensation is provided to an employee in exchange for services rendered. A similar logic is evident in Stanford’sGraduate Academic Policies and Procedures, which states that fellowships are “awarded on a merit or need basis,” and “no service is expected in return for a fellowship.” These arguments and policies, however, misrepresent the reality of fellows’ day-to-day work. Just like workers funded by assistantships (whose status as employees is not disputed , fellows are expected to perform research and teaching responsibilities at the direction of their advisors and in accordance with their program requirements. The performance of these services translates into a direct monetary benefit for the University. Fellows author highly cited research papers that give our institution its prestigious name. Fellows teach University undergraduates, performing the educational service that Stanford is charging tuition for. And, fellows apply for and bring in grants, from which the University takes a huge cut in the form of “indirect costs” to fund broader operations. The labor of fellows is a direct source of revenue for the University. Moreover, just like graduate workers funded by assistantships, fellows are subject to the working conditions set by Stanford. If a worker’s fellowship does not reachUniversity minimums, Stanford tops up their compensation to ensure that these workers receive the minimum pay. Thus fellows have a vested interest in University pay rates. Additionally, workers funded by fellowships pursue the same grievance procedures when responding to harassment and discrimination, and share the common interest of graduate workers in securing fair, neutral arbitration of disputes. Fellows receive the same benefits as students funded by assistantships and struggle with the same issues of affordability that come with living in one of the most expensive regions in the country. Denying fellows their right to participate in negotiations for the betterment of their conditions is a callous choice coming from an administration that claims to be promoting our well-being. Repeatedly throughout their tenure, our former president and provost spoke to us about their commitment to listening to graduate workers and supporting our needs. They repeated this refrain in their April 26 message: As “Stanford leaders we greatly value the many contributions our graduate students make to Stanford’s mission of teaching and research. We will continue working to understand, appreciate and be responsive to the needs of our graduate students, so that we may foster their well-being throughout their time at Stanford.” Graduate workers have spoken unequivocally on what our needs are. The membership of the SGWU recentlyratifiedcontract proposals calling for fellows’ inclusion in our bargaining unit. We haveissueda petition alongside to collect signatures in support of this demand. We invite everyone in our broader community, graduate worker or otherwise, to sign and join us in solidarity in this call. President Richard Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez: We invite you to break with the legacy of your predecessors. Demonstrate your intention to bargain with us in good faith by withdrawing the administration’s position that fellows should not be included in our bargaining unit. Voluntarily recognize all graduate workers, regardless of funding source, as members of our democratic union. Ari Beller is a graduate worker in psychology and a member of the SGWU.

crimson_2023_165,"I spent last summer in Tbilisi, Georgia, seeking a smattering of policy experience and a surplus of excellent food. I did not expect to depart frantically contemplating whether my identity is formed from within or without. Tbilisi embodies nuance and contrast. My quick strolls around the “world’s most Bohemian city” last summer might have revealed a Soviet-era housing block, a fourth-century Kartli fortress, and a pulsating techno club, one after another in dissonant harmony. All traces of nuance evaporate, however, when conversation shifts to the mass exodus of Russians who are leaving their imperial homeland in search of a site less prone to the discomforts of war (or international isolation , ultimately settling in quaint, vulnerable Georgia. The Georgian assessment seemed blunt, derisive, and near uniform: Russians represent violence and merit no hospitality. The unequivocal nature of Russian hatred in Georgia transformed my perspective on the institutions to which we tie ourselves, be they states or those much narrower. The question of whether an anti-Putin Russian should atone for the actions of their despot is not dissimilar in form — though obviously incomparable in scope — to the question of whether a Harvard student should atone for the ever-growing list of Harvard-born institutional misdeeds that keep internet petitions swirling around Cambridge airwaves. I do not know whether a Harvard student should bear responsibility for, say,the elitism that fuels the educationfrom which they benefit, nor whether some random family from Stavropol, Russia, deserves to face hostility on Tbilisi streets. But I do know this: People notice, perhaps above all else, the institutions we represent. It falls upon us to counteract hasty assumptions — lest our crowd-sourced institutional identities grow even more powerful. The intensity of the constructed Russian identity in Georgia makes complete sense. Since 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia via its northern border, gaining de facto control of 20 percent of its territory and killing 228 civilians, Russian forces have frequentlykidnapped and harmedGeorgian citizens caught near the occupation line and steadily pushed their illegal borders out onto new Georgian land,swallowing village pastures overnight. And yet, in Georgia’s capital city, just 60 kilometers away, Russians freely drink, dine, getinvited onstage at The Killers concerts, andsing pro-Russian ethno-anthemsin the street. Many of these Russian expatsfully support Putinand fled his regime’s reach only for economic reasons, or to dodge his draft. This naturally provokes strong rhetoric among Georgians — not to mention the spearhead of the free world. “No one should expect Georgians to welcome visitors from Russia,”announced the United States Ambassador to Georgiaover the summer, thereby throwing the full ideological power of the U.S. behind the reduction of individuals to the state from which they hail. The notion of being responsible for one’s state — or “collective responsibility” — is hardly new to political philosophy. In democracies such as ours, citizens form and guide governments, leading some scholars toargue that people share responsibilityfor the deeds of their states, regardless of their personal opinions. Indeed, just as a pacifist benefits from their state’s successful international conflict, a concerned Harvard student arguably benefits from the tuition payments of high-income studentsfavored by the admissions department, or perhaps even its historicaltransgressions against Indigenousandenslaved individuals, depending on how far one turns back the dial. These are, of course, highly subjective and oft-fought arguments that require uncomfortable reckoning with desert and agency. Less subjective is the considerable power that the institutions we represent hold over our external identities, shaping our impact on others before the first word spoken. No doubt this influence can be positive. But it more often leads to negative, or at least simplistic, impressions. To a foreigner, an American might more likely evoke notions of consumerism or obesity, while a working-class southerner might associate a Harvard student with coastal elitism or outsized arrogance rather than service-minded intelligence. In cases of egregious institutional crimes, such as the Russian invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, the negative association must be so intense that it begins to erase individuality altogether. It falls within our interests, then, to anticipate and defend against these uncontrollable assumptions, lest they actually come to define us. I have written before onHarvard’s unique capacityto consolidate broader societal grievances about elitism under one institutional umbrella, and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression’s recentlabeling of Harvardas the worst school for free speech — whether valid or not — will likely reinforce this reputation. So cut across the Harvard divide. Engage, respectfully and earnestly, with people dissimilar to you in belief system, geography, or level of education when opportunities present themselves. Resist the temptation to travel through comfortable channels replete with identical people. Leave Cambridge, at least for a weekend (or a month . To some, the “Harvard elitist” heuristic may prevent any chance of meaningful connection. It’s certainly difficult for Russians in Georgia to escape the impression that they represent a criminal regime. It is possible that we are all prisoners to collective responsibility; it is possible that our institutional definitions lie beyond revision. But no matter how futile, it merits attempting to define ourselves. Peter N. Jones ’25, a Crimson Editorial Editor, is a Government concentrator in Mather House."
crimson_2023_21,"The unfolding horror in Israel and Palestine has left our community and the world grieving and searching for answers. We have seen people slaughtered in the streets and watched families in unimaginable anguish after losing their loved ones. In response toHamas’ terror attack, the Israeli military hasdecimated neighborhoods,bombed hospitals, andcut off electricity, water, and foodfrom the Palestinian people. At least 11 United Nations staff, 30 students at U.N. schools, and four international Red Cross paramedics have been killed in Gaza, according to those organizations. And hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have beenmade homeless by Israeli airstrikes. Now, as Israel prepares for its ground invasion, it has asked an estimated 1.1 million Palestinians to relocate to the south of Gaza — an order the U.N.has called “impossible.”When asked what worries him most about a potential ground invasion, United States President Joe Biden’s answer was the same as mine: “Death.” The lessons of the Sri Lankan Civil War lead me to fear for what may be yet to come for Gaza. For decades, the Sri Lankan governmentengaged in violent conflictwith the Tamil Tigers, a separatist organization that committed acts of terrorism to further its cause. The groupattacked civilians, recruited children, and tortured prisoners. As a result, their actions were rightly condemned by the international community, just as Hamas’ have been this week. In the final years of their conflict with the Tamil Tigers, the Sri Lankan government made steady advances into Tiger-controlled territory, while designating no fire zones for civilians caught in the conflict. By the last year of the civil war, the government gained control of all but a tiny strip of land inhabited by around 300,000 Tamil civilians, which it again designated as a no-fire zone. Then, with the world watching, the Sri Lankan government indiscriminatelyslaughtered civilians in the same no-fire zonesit said were safe. It blocked provision of humanitarian aid. And it bombed food distribution lines and hospitals, including ones administered by the Red Cross. The U.N. reported that, during the final stages of the war, 40,000 to 70,000 Tamil civilians were killed by the Sri Lankan government — figures that the Sri Lankan governmentcontinues to deny. To put it in perspective, this would be proportionally equivalent to the killing of around 600,000 to 1.1 million civilians in the U.S. today. Did the Tamil Tigers, like Hamas, commit unjustifiable acts of terror against civilians? Yes. Did both precipitate humanitarian crises, through reprehensible acts such asusing civiliansas “human shields”? Again, yes. The West has rightly labeled both the Tamil Tigers and Hamas as terrorist organizations. But the West did not just condemn the Tamil Tigers. During the war, the United States and United Kingdom remained largely in support of the Sri Lankan government. The U.S. only halted some aid late in 2007 as human rights abuses soared to a level of sufficient concern. Even as the Sri Lankan government’s worst atrocities became clear in the last three years of the conflict, the United Kingdom continued selling arms to the country. The consequence: tens of thousands of innocent lives takenwith near impunity. The governments of the U.S. and all other liberal democracies must do everything in their power to prevent a similar outcome in Gaza. The horrific crimes committed by the Sri Lankan government against the Tamil population are a reminder of an important truth: It is in times of grief, trauma, and fear — such as the aftermath of a horrendous terrorist attack — that it is most difficult to protect human rights. It is also when our commitment to those principles is most necessary. Just as we unequivocally denounce Hamas notwithstanding the airstrikes, daily checkpoints, and blockades that people in Gaza have endured for decades, we must also hold the government of Israel accountable for any actions it takes, notwithstanding the rockets, mass kidnapping, and fear of extinction that drive its military assaults. For thousands of Palestinians, such accountability may mean the choice between life or death. In the end, the true test of a liberal democracy is our ability to hold other countries accountable for their actions, not just when they are our enemies, but even — especially — when they are our allies.

crimson_2023_149,"To fight for diversity on campus, we students have to talk about admissions. Behind every movement lies discourse. Only by the free exchange of ideas can we diagnose issues as worthy of action, identify solutions, and convince others to join us. That’s why the thing that unsettles me most about today’s decision is that admissions remains a dirty word on Harvard’s campus. There exists a politics of politeness that proscribes honest discussion about Harvard College’s admissions practices. This reluctance has long held back reform; now, it could restrain the student response to the fall of affirmative action too. This hush does not result from a shortage of worthy topics. Harvard College gives significant admissions advantages to legacies, recruited athletes, the children of faculty, and the children of donors, a group that iscollectively much whiter and wealthierthan the rest of the student body. It holds opena backdoor for the kids of the rich and powerfulin the form of the “Z-list.” And it slams the front door in the face of low-income students, withjust 4.5 percent of undergraduatescoming from the bottom quintile of the income distribution. In short, admissions at Harvard is perhaps more nakedly unfair than anywhere else in the nation. But, in my experience at least, you’ll hardly hear a word about admissions outside of affirmative action. Mostly, you’ll just find silence. This worries me, because if history is any guide, students have an essential role to play in holding the College accountable for reforming admissions practices to uphold diversity. Fromthe anti-war protests of the 1960s, tothe anti-Apartheid campaign of the 1980s, tothe divestment campaigns of the 2010s, it is students that drive change on college campuses — and often, from there, in the wider world. And, indeed,my peers have fought the good fightfor a racially diverse Harvard. Why, then, are we keeping mum about everything else wrong with admissions? The short answer is that we’re worried about being impolite. The essential problem with admissions discourse at Harvard is hidden in plain sight: We are the ones who got in. To talk about admissions is inescapably to talk about our own admission, and the admission of many of the people we love. As a result, criticizing the system feels needlessly indecent, like it questions whether any of us truly belong. So many of us stay quiet about our admissions hang-ups, or convince ourselves that they aren’t well-founded. “I know so many wonderful people admitted this way,” the logic goes, or “Admissions is arbitrary anyway.” I can appreciate this instinct to be circumspect. Kindness, respect, and humility matter greatly. But then I remember getting into Harvard, the first in my family to do anything like this. I remember the chest-emptying, body-shaking sobs from my mom. I remember the way my back crunched when my dad, blind with excitement, crushed me into a bear hug. I remember how my grandmother’s voice broke when she heard that I would attend the famous American university her husband, an immigrant from backwater Sicily, had always revered but would not live to see me enter. It was the raw, impolite joy of a family achieving a dream. These best of memories linger like ghosts when I think about all the people for whom Harvard is unjustly put out of reach. They are what makes my blood boil when peers have dissuaded me from talking about admissions (“I just think it’s better not to say anything,” or “I think that makes people uncomfortable” . The College’s admissions practices deny life-changing opportunities to the low-income people who have historically had them least and needed them most. Unless Harvard responds decisively to today’s decision, they could again do that for people of color. A response that maintains or improves diversity on campus fundamentally requires cutting admissions preferences that benefit the white and wealthy. Cognizant of those touchy tradeoffs, we keep quiet about admissions, leaving an unfair status quo unquestioned. If we are to defend diversity, admissions cannot remain a dirty word at Harvard. To those who want to see admissions reform, I encourage you to express your views honestly and openly. More often than not, speaking with candor, kindness, and respect — no hating on rich kids or legacies, no singling out “undeserving” individuals — will not arouse bad feelings. Sometimes a little impropriety is worth it, but you must try your utmost to approach these conversations with a maximum of care. Of course, these criticisms will occasionally feel uncomfortable. When that happens, we would do well to remember that the inscrutable, impossible game of tradeoffs that produced our admission says nothing about who we are or what we deserve — at least, not in the broader, real-life sense of our personal worth. With this in mind, we should each resist the urge to dissuade the admissions reformists, strive to engage in good faith, and seriously examine what we believe fair admissions would look like. When we talk about free speech, it’s the culture wars that leap to mind — conservative self-silencing, groupthink, cancel culture. Awash in this noise, it’s easy to forget that plain old etiquette is often the basic reason our speech is imperfectly free. Difficult conversations require we set aside this politics of politeness and delve to the heart of things. If we don’t, I fear that when the coming years call us to speak out for diversity on campus, we just won’t have the words.

stanforddaily_2023_95,"“Stanford is very quirky, but like, in a good way,” said the ProFro (Prospective Frosh I was hosting after a day full of Stanford festivities. They recalled HoHos (House Hosts waving dorm flags in rally gear, the vibrant and distinctive Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band playing, and the Stanford Fleet Street Singers harmonizing about peeing in the shower. Admit Weekend 2023 set a precedent for future Stanford Admit Weekends, being the first “normal” Admit Weekend where ProFros could stay in student dormitories since the Covid-19 pandemic. The class of ‘24, ‘25, and ‘26 were not able to get the full, or any, Stanford Admit Weekend experience. This year was a chance to revive one of Stanford’s most special traditions, but there were some challenges. The Admit Weekend Team had difficulty finding RoHos (Room Hosts this year. This could be due to the fact that those eligible to host did not have a full Admit Weekend experience; therefore, they might not have realized the significance of this tradition. As a result of the lack of RoHos, many ProFros had to sleep in dorm lounges. However, some dorms, such as Larkin and Donner, were able to accommodate all ProFros and get them into a room. This did, however, mean that there was more than one ProFro in some rooms. My roommate and I were able to host two admits, and it was a very rewarding experience. I could not attend Admit Weekend last year, and even those from the Class of ‘26 that could attend, could not take part in an integral part of the Admit Weekend experience: staying in the dorms. Since I could not participate during my year, I did not hesitate to apply when I heard that applications were open to support the 2023 Admit Weekend. Being a House Host and Room Host during Admit Weekend 2023 was a very exciting addition to my Stanford experience. Not only was I able to take part in a tradition I had not experienced, I also got areallycute shirt that says “Welcome HoHome.” And who doesn’t love free merch? Additionally, amidst the “Stanford Hates Fun,” movement, participating in Admit Weekend was a way to bring some of the fun back through traditions. HoHos welcomed ProFros to Stanford, guided them through campus, and helped them find their RoHos throughout the entire weekend. Additionally, HoHos were able to plan an on-call for ProFros to get more of a sense of the Stanford dorming experience. RoHos had a smaller commitment than HoHos, but seeing future Stanford students have an amazing time on campus was equally rewarding. RoHos provided hospitality to ProFros by answering any questions they had, letting them into dorms, and letting them sleep in their sleeping bags on the dorm floor. ProFros were not in the dorms for most of the day because they had fun events and programs lined up for them. In hosting ProFros, RoHos gave them a memorable experience that would make them want to participate in the next Admit Weekend when they are enrolled as frosh. With Admit Weekend 2023 coming to a close, all those that participated by being a HoHo, RoHo, or in any other way, are able to say they were a part of keeping a special Stanford tradition alive that this year’s ProFros will hopefully continue. Next year, more students should sign up to support Admit Weekend. This is one way the student body can contribute to a fun Stanford. Additionally, being a RoHo or a HoHo is a small time commitment that will keep Stanford traditions going. Not only is it a pretty great time, but it is also a way to warmly welcome new students to a place they will potentially spend the next four years of their lives.

rice_thresher_2023_55,"ByTyler Kinzy2/28/23 10:47pm In his 1995 essay “The Case for Letting Malibu Burn,” historian Mike Davis advocates for a “controlled burn” of the opulent — and wildfire-prone — California city. Continuing to pour resources into attempts at shielding Malibu from the natural fire cycle, Davis argues, is an unsustainable practice with numerous opportunity costs to the greater community. I invoke Davis’ essay title because the Student Association, like the insular fire zone he describes, faces its own legitimacy crisis. As evidenced by this year’s slew of uncontested races and a track record of low voter turnout, student apathy toward the SA runs rampant. Make no mistake, our community faces problems that demand action, but a question emerges: should Rice’s premier student government body still be framed as the main conduit for change? Put another way, is it time for a controlled burn of the SA? Logically, two primary options exist: try to work from within the SA structure or invest our limited time, resources, etc. into alternative forms of activism. Although the two aren’t entirely mutually exclusive and I believe the SA has utility in certain situations, I generally believe Rice would be better off with a paradigm shift away from SA-centric activism. When the advice students receive from those in positions of authority is an almost automatic suggestion to write a non-binding SA resolution, Rice’s activist culture — or lack thereof — shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. After all, most SA legislation, despite requiring weeks of work and bureaucracy, fails to materialize into tangible change. University administration rarely implements SA recommendations. Perhaps lackluster internal and external SA engagement isn’t the underlying illness, as the Thresher Editorial Board implied several weeks ago, but a mere symptom of an organization with intrinsic limitations. Take what is arguably the SA’s crown jewel achievement this year: a successful attempt to make the 2024 presidential Election Day a non-instructional day. I fully support this measure, but does the type of change the SA can create come anywhere close to matching the material impact of other activist organizations? Rice Mutual Aid, for example, has collected and distributed tens of thousands of dollars to low-income students. (I should add that, unlike the SA, RMA has accomplished this feat without the public platform of around-the-clock Thresher coverage . Similarly, there are countless ways to get involved beyond the hedges. While activism for many at Rice starts — and stops — at fruitless voting initiatives (a topic that could take up a whole article by itself , Houston is full of groups engaged in direct action and community organizing. The Houston Tenants Union has helped secure life-changing housing rights victories. The Houston Abolitionist Collective, to name another, builds community safety beyond the prison-industrial complex through educational events and materials, mutual aid, etc. Yet seemingly everywhere, from residential college emails to the pages of the Thresher, we repeatedly center the SA as the go-to agent of change. This is all the more troubling considering how activist resources are, by and large, zero-sum: every hour devoted to an SA resolution or committee directly trades off with an hour that could have been spent on other endeavors. Not only that, imagine if the spotlight the SA receives was redirected to the wonderful grassroots organizing work being done by activists outside of student government. Such a shift in focus might encourage other students, seeing desires to make an impact become actualized, to join these more meaningful and effective efforts. If the fundamental goal of activism is to leave our community in a better place than we found it, one of the first steps is determining which mechanisms and institutions can or can’t bring about the changes we want to create. Maybe the SA fizzling out of relevancy isn’t the crisis some claim it to be, but a welcome opportunity to transform activist discourse at Rice. Students losing faith in the SA isn’t some enigmatic phenomenon; it’s the natural progression of an organization whose design was always going to let us down—the natural fire cycle at work, if you will. It’s time to move on and allocate our activist resources elsewhere. It’s time to embrace a controlled burn. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.

state_press_2023_21,"Taylor Place, the first residence hall built on the Downtown campus, was renamed last Friday to Gordon Commons. Though the name seems more reminiscent of ivy-covered bricks than Downtown s humble lodgings, Gordon Commons honors a man who quietly but earnestly served his community. Honoring former Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon s legacy downtown rightfully gives credit to local leaders and serves as a reminder that good public service, no matter the scale, should be recognized. As is the case with many local officials, Gordon s name doesn t immediately spring to mind when thinking of influential civic leaders. This is despite the fact that our local leaders are the ones contributing the most to our daily lives. Gordon, for example, constructed a college environment byinvestingin Downtown Phoenix. Part of the reason Phoenix has been so successful as a city is we ve had the right elected officials at the right time, said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego in a speech at the renaming ceremony. The fact that so many community leaders are here today to celebrate Phil Gordon really shows what a difference he has made. READ MORE:Taylor Place residential hall in downtown Phoenix renamed Gordon Commons Gordon s administration poured $1 billion into developing downtown s infrastructure — $223 million of which went toward the development of the Downtown Phoenix campus. The now iconic deal scribbled across a napkin between ASU President Michael Crow and Gordon bloomed into the vibrant cityscape we know today, bustling with businesses and bursting at the seams with young people. (Gordon wanted to make certain that the democracy was more successful going forward, wanted to make certain that the world was being moved forward in a positive direction, wanted to make certain that the city could be better and more beautiful than it was given to him, Crow said in a speech at the renaming ceremony. It s significant that Taylor Place was renamed and not another building. It was one of the first buildings constructed on the Downtown campus as part of Crow and Gordon s plan. Since its completion in 2009, the residence hall has been a home away from home, students first taste of life on their own within a new community. It s where we all found ourselves after leaving the nest for the first time in our lives, a bunch of wide-eyed young strangers brought together by our selected majors, said Evan Lis, president ofUndergraduate Student Government Downtown, in his speech at the renaming ceremony. However, it was within the walls of TP, now Gordon Commons, that we discovered that we weren t really all on our own here. In fact, far from it. The residence hall isn t only stamped by fond collegiate nostalgia. It s perfectly situated to help students follow in Gordon s footsteps. (Gordon Commons not only facilitates their ability to be successful but also develops their love and passion for the Phoenix community, Christiana Sletten, the University s Director for Residential Life, said in her speech at the renaming ceremony. Higher education institutions typically name buildings after wealthy donors and influential alumni. Money buys immortality, persisting in recognition even when its possessor is gone. By choosing to name a place that holds such significance to students after Gordon, ASU pays its dues in a profound and sincere way to a figure who did so much for the downtown community. The University didn t have to rename Taylor Place, a years-old residence hall with an established presence. Arguably, renaming it seemed unproductive and illogical. Yet, it was simply the right thing to do, ensuring that the legacy of a civil servant wouldn t be forgotten. We tend to look at political history in an overly macroscopic way, often skipping over the smaller players that paved the literal road under our feet. Renaming Taylor Place doesn’t seem like much in the grand scheme of things, but it’s those tributes building over time that make the difference. Even if it’s as simple as knocking down President Zachary Taylor s name in order to make room for Mayor Gordon s. Edited by Kate Duffy, Reagan Priest and Caera Learmonth.

stanforddaily_2023_83,"Back in July 2020, when the pandemic was just getting into full swing, the Daily released anopinionby Kiara Bacasen ’22 MS ’22 and Daniella Caluza ’22 summarizing their thoughts about Stanford students living off campus in the Bay Area during the pandemic and online classes. They highlighted how bad the housing crisis in the Bay Area is, and how Stanford students were contributing to it by moving into low-income housing that could have been reserved for local residents. Regardless of whether you were FLI or a person of color—as a Stanford student, that was gentrification at work. Sadly, Stanford’s online schooling wasn’t the first or last time Stanford students (soon-to-be techies, entrepreneurs, and consultants would contribute to the displacement of locals in the Bay Area. The housing crisis ravaging America has long been driven by institutions and thewealthy white peoplewho run them. This is something that’s been happening ever since Stanford set roots here, displacing the indigenousOhlone people. It’s been happening since thedestruction of the Fillmorein the 1960s, the subsequent white flight into the suburbs of the East Bay, thecreation of BARTand its destruction of West Oakland in the early 70s and the restrictive covenants placed around the Bay that madeEast Palo Alto one of the few places Black people could rent fromin the until the 80s. Gentrification reallypicked upsince Google, Facebook and venture capitalists implanted themselves into the Bay Area during the creation of the Silicon Valley and the peak of the dot-com boom in 1999. The effects of this are felt today, withStanfordand tech giants likeFacebookstill taking part in the housing mess they have contributed towards. While thedefinition of gentrification—the “transformation of a poor neighborhood in cities by the process of middle- and upper-income groups buying properties in such neighborhoods and upgrading them”—was coined by Ruth Glass in 1964, it has evolved to mean something much more as the Bay’s housing crisis continues to grow and change. Definitions of gentrification now come with a more complex look at the wealth gap driven by not just the tech industry, but capitalism as a whole. As someone who was born and raised in the Bay Area, and is now a Stanford student, my personal experience with gentrification and the wealth gap here is a bit more unique. I grew up in Newark, CA, the small suburb directly across the Dumbarton Bridge from East Palo Alto. My parents, both immigrants from Mexico, moved our family here when I was two years old. They enrolled my sister and I in a private Catholic school, since the schools in Newark were terrible at the time. I didn’t really understand that I had a different learning experience from other kids in Newark until I was in 5th or 6th grade, when my soccer teammates told me how Newark Junior High (the only junior high in Newark was full of teachers who didn’t care and lacked resources for all of the students. All problems of underfunded, POC-majority schools. I didn’t experience it myself until I went to high school. Newark Memorial High School wasn’t a great school, being half unwilling, half unable to give all their students what they needed. They had some smart kids that “made it out,” either going to four year colleges or finding a good job in tech. But most people didn’t get the attention, money and support they deserved. We were a poorer suburb—nothing like the neighboring cities of Fremont or Palo Alto (just thirty minutes away , where they had extensive infrastructure and stellar high schools. The city didn’t help eithe—six figure jobs in Newark went to city and school administration, allwhile classroom sizes grew and teachers and counselors were fired. TheCity of Newark also closed two elementary schoolsin 2020, citing a budget deficit of $6 million, while simultaneouslybuilding a new civic centerfor city administrators, police department, and library, with a budget of $72.3 million, created out of a sales tax increase.It was here, experiencing all this, that I started to understand how unfair the education and political system was in Newark. Unfortunately, I didn’t know how deep the roots ran.I figured that going into higher education was a way to not only get myself out of this situation, but come back and help my community as well. Stanford was my dream school—ever since my mom worked as a nanny for Stanford professors. Plus, Stanford was my only way of affording a four year university, with its policy to give full tuition scholarships to anyone under $120,000. So when I did get in, with tuition fully paid for, I figured life was going up from there. Unfortunately, while Stanford came with privileges and opportunities, it also came with socioeconomic discrimination, just by being a Latine from the Bay Area who wasn’t part of the wealthy majority of students. Before I was accepted, my family and I had to move out of our house, since the bank forcibly foreclosed it on us the summer before my junior year. We ended up moving to my dad’s childhood home in North Fair Oaks, an unincorporated area of San Mateo County. With my family there, and me at Stanford, I experienced for myself theenormouswealth gap that exists in the Silicon Valley.The top 10% of Silicon Valley earners hold 75% of its wealth. The average income for the region in 2021 was $170,000, but the average income for service workers in the Silicon Valley was $31,000.Just two street lights away from my home in North Fair Oaks, is one of the wealthiest neighborhood in the United States: Atherton, witha median household income above $250,000,and amedian home price of $6.3 million.The admissions, class differences, support systems, student culture, endowment: it was like nothing I had ever experienced in my life. The Peninsula was a whole other place, full ofabsurdlywealthy people. Stanford contributed to that—having direct ties to not only the Silicon Valley and its tech strongholdings, but political, economic and educational elites worldwide—creating the culture of wealth and elitism that is Stanford’s brand. I would like to note that we are privileged to have not moved out of the Bay Area. My grandparents have had that house since the 80s, and let us rent from them. Without them, we would have been like everyone else—moving to theCentral Valley. When the pandemic hit, I was filled with even more disrespect for Stanford than I had before, witnessing students gentrifying the Mission and service workersbeing firedwithout a second thought. How could the University not protect the very workers that they relied on to keep the school running? Why doesn’t Stanford build subsidized, rent controlled and/or low-income housing for its service workers, instead of having them commute long hours almost every day, with somecoming up to 75 miles awayfrom the Central Valley? How was it that students rented out cheaper and low-income housing in the Bay when all the dorms stood empty? I don’t blame students so much—while they are complicit, most are aware of the privileges that they hold from the Stanford name. They shouldn’t be taking rental units, but it’s also not their fault there’s not enough affordable housing, or that Stanford kicked everyone out. I blame Stanford as an institution, and capitalism as a whole. The system, and the institutions that uphold them, are the ones to blame. This is not simply just a conversation about gentrification. This is a conversation aboutwealth, and thehuge gapbetween the top 0.1% and the rest of us. So despite my experience growing up in the Bay Area, I don’t think abolishing the tech industry, or putting a ban on “outsiders” is a solution to the issues. The reality is that the tech industry is here to stay in the Bay Area. It’s part of our everyday lives, with iPhones, the internet, computer programs. The Bay Area has always been a place of major commerce, and if we somehow took away the Silicon Valley, another industry will come to replace it. What wedoneed to do is make things more even. We need those in power (tech companies, political figures, Stanford to care, and to try. That includes Stanford students, who directly contribute to the wealth gap and housing crisis just by moving into and getting jobs in the Bay. You aren’t the source, but you hold partial blame. You might not be purposefully displacing families, or raising the price of rent yourself or building luxury single family homes or apartments—but you are the market. You are the ones that these companies, these developers, are looking for, to “beautify” and “renovate” the neighborhoods they are “investing in.” I can’t stop you from buying homes and getting good jobs, but hopefully I can make you think about the ripples you are making as you do so.

state_press_2023_1,"In comparison, Tempe has an entirely different atmosphere. It feels like everyone is going out on the weekends and romanticizing this idea of the college experience. Tempe is often seen as the face of ASU, a larger-than-life campus bustling with students and rowdy with football games and the hallmarks of the college experience. This perception tends to devalue the unique offerings of the Downtown, Polytechnic and West Valley campuses, where students have an experience that is just as exciting and rewarding. Although Tempe is the largest campus, with over57,000students enrolled, its large size can be a liability for students seeking more one-on-one learning and a tight-knit college community. For Tymber Klahr, a freshman studying journalism, Downtown s compact campus is ideal for building community connections. “I feel like it’s very community-based, Klahr said. I sense a lot more community Downtown than I do in Tempe. Coming from a small town to one of the biggest schools in the country, being downtown, I feel that helped me adjust a lot more.” Karah Mayer, a sophomore studying biology who lives on the West Valley campus, said attending a smaller campus helps her connect with the people around her. “I enjoy that I m seeing a lot of the same people in all my classes and that I ve gotten to make really close connections with people living on campus and stuff like that,” Mayer said. “So I ve enjoyed that tight-knit aspect of living and taking classes on the West campus.” In comparison, Tempe has an entirely different atmosphere. It feels like everyone is going out on the weekends and romanticizing this idea of the college experience – what adults look back on and call the best years of their lives. It pressures students to have a vibrant social life and constantly seek out new, interesting things to do. Fiorella Vultaggio, a senior studying applied biological sciences with a concentration in pre-veterinary medicine, doesn’t think the college experience Tempe offers is necessary to enjoy campus life, primarily if the student is focused on the academic side of college. “When you think about a traditional college experience, a lot of people want to do the sororities, go to all the events and be with big groups of people,” Vultaggio said. “But if you re looking for more of an academic experience, I think that Poly is a better place to be.” Vultaggio said that despite being smaller than Tempe, Polytechnic still puts on fun events and has beautiful facilities, showing that students there aren t socially desolate. Students often equate having a good college experience with the stereotypical Tempe college experience. Although that may be true for some, others may have different ideas of what they want their college experience to look like. READ MORE:ASU students reflect on how a one university in many place model spurs disparate campus cultures The good thing about ASU is that all students don t have to compromise, since all four campuses are connected as part of ASU sOne University in Many Placesmodel. “(At West, I ve had a really good experience because, at the end of the day, it s still part of ASU, Mayer said. So you still have access to all of the ASU-based resources. So I know that I ve been able to still make close connections to faculty here and still have those same opportunities as students down at Tempe.” Despite the physical distance between each campus, the ASUshuttle systemkeeps everyone connected.Sun Cardswork on every campus so students can use facilities on other campuses and socialize with students outside of their home campus. This means that students can still travel to Tempe whenever they want to. Being at the Downtown, Poly or West campus isn t solitary confinement away from the main ASU campus, but rather a refuge away from the bustle. In some ways, those campuses have less going on than Tempe, but that s their charm. Even if there’s not as much going on in the smaller campuses as in Tempe, perhaps it’s that expectation that there needs to be a lot going on that’s letting people down. Vultaggio thinks that students getting involved on campus is vital to have a solid college experience, not the size of the campus. “Be involved with something, whether it s a sports club, whether it s another type of club or getting a job on campus,” Vultaggio said. “Those are all things that I ve been able to get more connections with. Be more interactive with people and faculty. Ultimately, no universal college experience works for everyone. For too long, Tempe has been positioned as the best ASU campus to be on, when in reality, the Downtown, Polytechnic and West Valley campuses also have a lot to offer for students looking for community. A great college experience should be what students do with their own time and based on their interests. Whether that s rushing for a sorority in Tempe or sitting quietly in the shade of West Valley, every ASU campus has its own vision of a great college experience. However, these differences should not discount the value ASU s three satellite campuses bring. Edited by Mia Osmonbekov, Walker Smith and Sadie Buggle. Reach the reporter atarebored@asu.edu.

rice_thresher_2023_43,"ByAlizay AzeemandAnna Rajagopal4/18/23 9:38pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. This year marks the 75th year since the horrific events of the Nakba began. Al-Nakba, an Arabic phrase meaning ‘The Catastrophe,’ refers to Israel’s ethnic cleansing and violent dispossession of the Palestinian people and the establishment of the Zionist settler-colony. Between 1947 and 1949,15,000 Palestinians were killed and over 750,000 were forcefully displacedby Zionist military forces to create the state of Israel. These events, cumulatively with the current violence perpetrated by the Zionist entity, have been characterized as genocide by Palestinian organizers, journalists, and activists working towards the liberation of their people from colonial rule. But the Nakba isn’t over — it’s ongoing. 75 years later, Israel continues its brutal oppression of the Palestinian people. Just last week, during the holy month of Ramadan, Israeli forces beat Palestinian worshippers at Al-Aqsa Mosque bloody, injuring at least 31 and detaining over 400 —a violent attack condemned by the United Nations as “reckless and lawless.” At a time when global support for Palestinian liberation is increasing, Rice University’s Baker Institute has not only turned a blind eye to the atrocities being committed by Israel but also has chosen to endorse them by hosting perpetrators of such violence on our campus. While Palestinians grieve 75 years of ongoing genocide, the Baker Institute’s “Israel at 75” conference — set to take place on April 27 — celebrates 75 years of Israeli colonization and aggression. We refuse to allow Rice University to engage in the normalization of Israeli aggression and demand the university cancel the conference. Among the Zionists that the Baker Institute has invited are men who decorate their careers with the state-sanctioned murder of Palestinian men, women, and children. Rice plans on hosting Ehud Barak, the former Prime Minister of Israel, who previously faced a war crimes arrestwarrantfor the murders of1400 Palestiniansduring his role as Operation Cast Lead as the Defense Minister of Israel. While he acted as Defense Minister, it wasfoundthat the Israel Defense Forces violated international humanitarian law by using white phosphorus that created a ‘rain of fire,’ killing and injuring Palestinian civilians, as well as destroying schools and hospitals. Barak has also maintained a steady siege on Gaza, expanded the apartheid wall and ordered the assassinations of Palestinian political leaders. Institutions such as Yale University have facedcriticismfor hosting him in past years, as he is recognized by many as a war criminal. Also invited to Rice University is Isaac Herzog, the current President of Israel, who further entrenchesfascisminto the lives of Palestinians; since his election, hundreds of Zionists have burned Palestinian homes and cars to the ground. Instead of actively working to counter this violence from his position of authority, Herzog has simply offered platitudes. Michael Herzog is also set to appear, a former military strategist for Israel who is anindicted war criminal. Herzog faced proceedings in Spain for his 2002 ‘al-Daraj’ bombings of civilians in Gaza, Palestine,killing nine children. But we, as Rice University students, committed to justice for all peoples on our campus, don’t have to idly stand by while Rice spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on catering to men who are recognized to have engaged in the most brutal of war acts against civilians and families. We must refuse to allow the normalization of colonialism and apartheid on our campus. Rice, an institution that claims to “contribute to the betterment of the world,” should lead by action and immediately cancel “Israel at 75.” Our campus is home to Palestinian students, organizations and community; what is Rice saying to them when our university hosts men who have massacred Palestinian villages?Rice University Students for Justice Palestine, in collaboration with Students for Justice in Palestine at the University of Houston, Palestinian Youth Movement Houston and Jewish Voice for Peace Houston, have invited us to sign apetitiondemanding better from and for our home. When we demonstrate principled solidarity towards freedom — when we refuse the comforting insularity of staying behind Rice’s hedges and instead push for more — we decide who we are. Are we going to be a student body that is okay with war criminals coming to our campus? Or are we going to make a stand? All oppression is interconnected, and, so too, is all liberation; from standing with thepeoples of the Philippinesto supportingIndigenous rights movementshere on Turtle Island — nobody’s free until everybody’s free.

state_press_2023_37,"The game will ultimately come down to whether or not Mahomes completes nearly impossible passes and outsmarts Philadelphia’s defense. While the media hypes up Philadelphia to crush Kansas City in the Super Bowl, Patrick Mahomes and his clutch offense will lead the Chiefs to their second title in just four seasons. Eagles fans swear by their teams offense – led by Jalen Hurts – that scored28.1 points per game on average this season. Hurts has a plethora of receivers and running backs to call on such as A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, who both recorded over 1,000 receiving yards this season. The Eagles offense also has a respectable running game powered by Miles Sanders and Hurts mobile quarterback style. However, Philadelphia s success is due to its cakewalk of a regular season. Prior to the 2022 season, the Eagles scheduleranked as the third-easiestin the NFL. While Hurts led his team to an impressive 14-3 record, five of those wins were against the five worst defenses in the NFL, four of which were one-possession games. Meanwhile, Kansas City wastied with San Francisco for the fifth-hardest schedule this season. Despite the Chiefs challenging road to the Super Bowl, Andy Reid s offense led the league by averaging 29.2 points and about 413 yards per game this season. Kansas City has also been tested in its tough playoff games, beating a surging Jaguars team coached by Doug Pederson and Joe Burrow s Bengals. On the other hand, Philadelphia faced a weak Giants team and the 49ers, a team without a healthy quarterback. When it comes time for Philadelphia to face a real foe, who knows how Hurts will react under pressure? While the Eagles are praised for their offense, Kansas City owes its success to reinventing its offense after losing Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins. The Chiefs signed JuJu Smith-Schuster and Marques Valdes-Scantling and traded for Kadarius Toney midseason. The trio of receivers has excelled this season and helped take defensive pressure off Travis Kelce, the best tight end in football. Most surprisingly, Isiah Pacheco, Kansas City s seventh-round draft pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, has been explosive out of the backfield and averages 4.9 yards per carry. On the other side of the field, the Eagles are praised for their stellar defense. Philadelphia excels in pass defense and allowed just 179.8 passing yards per game on average. The Eagles also led the NFL with 70 sacks this season, powered by Hassan Reddick s 16 sacks. Nevertheless, the Chiefs passing game will overcome the Eagles defensive pressure. This season, Kansas City led the league in passing byaveraging 297.8 yards per game. Mahomes, the odds-on favorite to be crowned the NFL MVP, is comfortable outside the pocket and can cripple defenses with his precise passing. Kansas City s powerful offensive line will also nullify the Eagles front seven. This season, the Chiefs led the league in team pass block win rate andhad the third best team run block win rate. Even if Philadelphia can cover Kelce, Kansas City s offensive line will give Mahomes plenty of time to work his magic and find an open receiver. The Chiefs can also utilize Pacheco and Clyde Edwards-Helaire to capitalize on the Eagles poor rushing defense that allowed an average of 121.6 yards per game this season. While the teams are neck-and-neck in most aspects, the two coaches are polar opposites. Reid is a veteran who has proven his ability to craft innovative plays capable of breaking any defense, whereas Nick Sirianni is a young coach with little experience. If the Eagles breach the Chiefs offensive line, don t be surprised if it s a designed play by Reid. Nevertheless, the game will ultimately come down to whether or not Mahomes completes nearly impossible passes and outsmarts Philadelphia s defense. When he s fully healthy, Mahomes is one of the greatest quarterbacks ever and can will his team to victory. As Mahomes has proven time and time again, never count out a team with him calling the shots. When time expires in the fourth quarter, Mahomes will claim his second Lombardi Trophy and cement his reign as the most dominant quarterback in the post-Tom Brady era. Then? Kansas City fans will celebrate peacefully while Philadelphia destroys itself after its third championship loss in less than four months.

thetech_mit_2023_7,"I said it. Wondering if you heard me correctly? Well, let me confirm for you — I said it. OnFebruary 23, 2023andApril 19, 2023, Vice Chancellor and Dean for Student Life Suzy Nelson wrote to the community about problematic postering and chalking found around campus. The provocative messages featured distasteful, disgusting portrayals of a wide range of sociopolitical issues, such as the right of LGBTQ+ individuals to adopt children, MIT’s involvement infeeding radioactive oatmeal to children with disabilities who were in state care, sexual assault and harassment rates on campus, MIT faculty and staff having sex with students, and more. I was a member of a postering campaign responsible for these messages. My article will answer a simple, yet complex, question: Why? As I wrote in an op-ed inThe TechonNovember 9, 2022, free expression does not come freely. Someone has to pay a price. The campaign team of which I was a member was composed of marginalized students heated and passionate about the pattern at MIT, and in the broader society, of our communities paying the highest price for others’ free expression. Let me provide some examples. In my first-year spring, a professor asked if I was in the United States legally after I mentioned that I was born in Mexico. When I jokingly called a friend in a friend group a straggot (a queer term referring a straight person , a stranger to the group asked why he couldn’t say faggot if I was allowed to say straggot . When I needed to receive a monkeypox vaccine this past summer, my nurse made AIDS jokes in the hallway before commenting that she was fed up with having to treat gay prostitutes — and no, I’m not a prostitute for the record. Are these examples of free expression or examples of discrimination? When there is a conflict — and there will be one eventually — between a right to free expression and a right to be free of discrimination, what value prevails? At MIT, the answer seems to be free expression. This answer did not sit right with the postering campaign team, who felt that the MIT Ad Hoc Working Group on Free Expression (FEWG ’sreportand faculty-approvedstatementfailed to wrestle with students’ concerns about discrimination, bias, and harassment. Where can, and should, the line between free expression and other moral values and legal obligations be drawn? This was the guiding question for the campaign. While the FEWG’sstatementmakes clear that “MIT does not protect direct threats, harassment, plagiarism, or other speech that falls outside the boundaries of the First Amendment,” it is the belief of the postering campaign that the MIT community is not aware that is must support the legal right of such expression since it fallswithinthe First Amendment (i.e., does not violate Institute policy . While community members certainly do not have to agree with the content of a poster, theymust, under MIT’s policy, agree with the legal right for such expression to be heard. For example, some posters featured speech fromSnyder v. Phelps, which upheld speech from the Westboro Baptist Church, featuring slogans such as “God Hates Fags”, “Thank God for Dead Soldiers”, and “Same-Sex Parents Doom Kids” — slogans that arewithinthe First Amendment, slogans thatare allowedby MIT. Now, as a queer person, do I support the content of these messages? Heck no. No matter how “offensive or injurious”, words from the FEWG’s statement, this speech may be, they are nevertheless allowed at MIT (and yes, this is the same FEWG that only had faculty as members yet seek to influence what free expression should look like for theentireMIT community . President Kornbluth can preach all day about the “distinction between what wecansay to each other — in other words, what we have arightto say — and what weshouldsay to each other”, but her opinion has no bearing on the question of:can, notshould, I poster harmful speech? President Kornbluth’s answer? Yes. You have a legal right to poster harmful speech — go wild. Why? MIT’s policies protect such speech. In fact, when an MIT administrator violated Institute policy by taking down a poster in February, they were warned that “per MIT’s Office of the General Council, it is recommended that community members refrain from taking down the posters in question as to do so may be in violation of MIT postering guidelines.” The postering campaign curated intentionally provocative postering that complied with all content-neutral policies, contrary toallegations from Professor Edward Schiappathat such posters were not signed. To be signed a poster must contain three elements: sponsoring party, contact information, and date of postering. Since there are no requirements for the size of the font, or even language saying such signing must be obvious, the posters were signed in small font (e.g., size 3 . Furthermore, the postering campaign noted, and documented, several instances ofonlyits posters being taken down while other posters thatwere notsigned were allowed to stay up. This unequal enforcement of signing policies demonstrates viewpoint discrimination: “Hey, President Kornbluth, isn’t this what you’ve made the MIT community work so hard to prevent?” This situation poses the question of what weight does, or can, Institute policy carry if MIT is unwilling to honor its promises or policies whether one agrees or disagrees with said policy. The campaign sought to test the limit between free expression and other competing values and obligations, such as discrimination and harassment. I want to emphasize that Institute policies hold an incredible amount of power. For example, the Mind & Hand book, which has afree expression policyprotecting the postering campaign, prevents me from facing disciplinary charges no matter how offensive my actions by postering were. This should be upsetting. I was told by a member of MIT’s Bias Response Team that the postering campaign solicited the most amount ofInstitute Discrimination and Harassment Response (IDHR reports, yet I was not summoned once by IDHR yet alone disciplined for my actions. Why? Because the postering campaign broke no policies. MIT allows the speech in the postering campaign. Again, if you are upset at the postering campaign, I would encourage you to ask: should good policy, good law, allow the speech of the postering campaign to occur? That is a question for you to answer, and I hope you do since the FEWG has already assumed the answer on your behalf: yes. I want to be clear that the MIT administration knew about my involvement in the postering campaign since February 2023 but could do little, naynothing, to discipline me because they are the ones to allow the postering campaign in the first place. If you are interested in learning more about how the postering campaign advocated to senior leadership I encourage to explore theseslidesandone-pager of recommendationsthat were presented to Chancellor Melissa Nobles, Provost Cyntheia Barnhart, Chair of the Faculty Lily Tsai, Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Suzy Nelson, Dean David Randall, and several faculty members of the FEWG. I am on the record as being an early opponent of the FEWG’s statement and report, which dismissed the undue burden free expression often places on marginalized communities — the point the postering campaign intended to convey. I want an MIT that can and will protect me as a minority student, but I can assure you that is not the MIT of today nor of the near future unless the MIT administration is willing to recognize their misstep in failing to wrestle with the reality that free expression rights have a steep cost for marginalized communities. I also want to address a few counterarguments that I have heard during the postering campaign. First, why poster during CPW? If MIT wants to stand by its free expression policies, then it should do so at all times, including, or perhaps especially, when dinner guests are over. People who are considering whether or not to call MIT home for the next four years deserve to know exactly the type of campus MIT can foster. If the MIT administration believes admitted students should not be exposed to what the Institute’s free expression policies allow, then they ought to change those policies. The MIT administration must decide what is more important, free expression or MIT’s public perception and ability to yield members of the admitted class. The winning answer seems to be free expression because, even though she may not agree with the content of the posters, at no time did President Kornbluth negate the legality of the posters. Seriously, look back at previous communications from President Kornbluth — are there any mentions of the posters violating MIT policy? The answer is no. Why? The posters are allowed under MIT’s free expression policies, and the posters only follow what MIT’s policies allow. Second, why were only certain identity groups targeted? The members of the postering campaign limited its content to our communities. For example, I would make a poster about Latinx issues, since I am Latinx, but I would not be comfortable making content about other racial or ethnic groups that I do not belong to — this was a personal decision, not a legal one. The shock value of the posters is not lost when limiting myself to groups I am deeply familiar with. Third, why use harmful speech if that is the very thing you are protesting? The postering campaign is exposing a flaw with the way this campus deals with this free expression by creating a simulated experience. We personally do not agree with the content on the posters, but with the rise of radicalization of certain groups, it is a real possibility that there will come a time when people post such content sincerely (I have certainly seen such statements growing up in the Deep South . We hope the MIT administration will recognize the impact of this policy as this campaign serves as a case study. If the MIT administration chooses to prioritize the mental health of marginalized groups, it will take concrete measures to prevent and address hateful postering via policy change. Until such a policy change is made, MIT is signaling that free expression is more important than students’ mental health in moments of peril. Additionally, I can testify that much of the content featured in the posters is influenced by the lived experiences of members of the postering campaign. No one today supports conversion therapy right? Nope, try again. As a queer child growing up in Louisiana, my first experience with mental health services was my conversion therapist. I made posters about conversion therapy to demonstrate that this is a real conversation and ongoing debate that LGBTQ+ people will have to wrestle with, and if you are LGBTQ+ and have not had to wrestle with this issue, consider yourself lucky. Fourth, why continue postering? We want change. If you are upset with continued postering, then be upset with the MIT administration, for they are the ones to legally support our ability to poster. My decision to participate in the postering campaign was not one made lightly. I decided to join in the effort because I wanted, and still want, an MIT that supports students on the margin. When I opened Canva to make posters quoting pro-conversion therapy arguments, I was reminded of my time in the Texas conversion therapy center that my father sent me to. But whatever discomfort I felt, I knew it was also important to show that policyneedsto change. While I know that President Kornbluth probably has not had to deal with homophobia in her life, I have and probably will for the rest of my life. I want the MIT administration to know the tax they impose on marginalized communities. I sacrificed a lot for the postering campaign, including being doxxed: my right to privacy was violated with my name and living space shared publicly, including on a Twitter thread that at the time had nearly 250,000 views. Additionally, I have had to endure harassment from the MIT community, ranging from unsolicited knocks on my door, to receiving fraudulent emails in my name and falling victim to food tampering. The harassment was so severe, persistent, and pervasive that the MIT administration had to move me out of East Campus to a safe living space (imagine the Witness Protection Program — that’s my new life . Despite all these injuries, however, my zealous advocacy to use activist methods to press some of the most challenging free expression dilemmas remains intact. As a personal reflection, in participating in this postering campaign, I realized there is an issue beyond that of free expression: MIT’s honoring of its own policies. Time and time again, I reported instances of MIT violating its own policies, violating students’ rights. For example, despite theMind & Hand Bookexplicitly saying that “It is not appropriate to remove or deface the poster,” community members, including MIT administrators, violated this principle. While I can agree with the intention behind why someone might want to remove the poster, I do not believe the solution is tobreaka policy — an offense that the postering campaign hasnotcommitted. Removed from the topic of free expression, what right, if any, can be secure if MIT does not honor its commits of what rights community members have. If MIT doesn’t honor its free expression obligations, how can I be sure MIT will fulfill its anti-discrimination or anti-sexual assault obligations? It is scary to me that an Institute can pick and choose what rights to recognize and can recognize rights only when it is convenient. The practice of MIT administration desecrating student rights — the rights embedded in the contract made via via the Mind & Hand Book — should cause alarm to anyone who cares about individual rights. While I protest the free expression policy, I recognize that whatever is written as policy is the law of the land — this is why I seek to see a change in policy. It is concerning that MIT is so wishy-washy with its policies. If MIT allows for free expression in policy to differ from free expression in practice, how can I be sure that when, for example, I am being harassed MIT will honor its anti-harassment policies? MIT policy should match MIT practices. I understand that not everyone will agree with the message or method of the postering campaign, and I accept this fact and respect it. Despite the controversy behind the postering campaign, I remain supportive of its intentions: (1 awareness of what MIT’s free expression allows and will protect and (2 demonstrate that the MIT community is not willing to accept the postering campaign on its legal merits, despite its compliance with Institute policies. Put simply, MIT needs to rework its policies. My aim now is to provide my story, which before this moment, has not been made public. I urge you to evaluate my arguments, agree or disagree, and let this movement contribute to our collective understanding of why policies, practices, and people are critical in shaping the MIT you want to see. I hope this moment of care towards free expression does not escape us. David Spicer is a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in political science, and is a member of the MIT Pre-Law Society."
crimson_2023_108,"Last year, I lived in Straus Hall, a wonderful freshman dorm and a prime location for late sleepers and late-night snackers. However, while Straus A-11’s location on Massachusetts Avenue offered a rare proximity to classrooms and El Jefe’s (I often reminisce on the immediacy of such locations as I schlep from the Quad , living so close to the square also offered a different proximity — a less comfortable proximity. On any given night in Straus, as I shut my lights off and tucked myself into a warm bed, concerned with readings and essays, someone else may have been staving off the elements and searching for rest just twenty feet away, concerned with survival. Now, I pass by the same people daily as I make my way down Mass. Ave. from the Quad. We exist so close together, yet it feels like we operate in different universes. Harvard Square can be numbing. Headphones in, head down, hurrying to get to lecture, one can look past the crisis that manifests less than a hundred feet outside our glorified dormitories. Tunnel vision of classes and extracurriculars blind us to the experiences — perhaps the very existence — of people living on the streets. The man shaking a cup outside the Coop, the young woman who carries her bags with her in the Yard each day, or the Spare Change News vendor who greets everyone with a smile don’t fit the typical mold for Harvard interactions. They don’t offer job prospects, social opportunities, or LinkedIn connections. Stopping to say hello, buying someone a meal, or even looking up and smiling is a renunciation of the time-optimized lifestyle we feel so constantly obligated to follow. Where in my Google Calendar is space dedicated to sitting and talking with an unhoused person? Separated from us by only a brick wall, a black fence, and a bulwark of elite education, the folks who sleep on Mass. Ave. benches are just as much my neighbors as my friends down the hall. They are just as much members of the community as temporary Institute of Politics Fellows and traveling dignitaries, as present in students’ day-to-day lives as their proctors and their professors, and as deserving of basic kindness, dignity, and respect as each student who receives a coveted acceptance letter in the mail. The presence of peopleexperiencing houselessnessat Harvard is undeniable, and the suffering in our streets is palpable, especially in the midst of acold and unforgiving Cambridge winter. The unhoused folks in Harvard Square are our neighbors, and neighbors need to care for each other. This isn’t a piece onHarvard’s devastating impacts on the housing market.It isn’t a call to build more public housing, nor a reflection on the causes ofrising housing insecurity across our nation. I have no policy to offer that could immediately fix our problems or house our neighbors. Regretfully, many of those decisions are out of my control. I can control how I walk through the Square, though. I can choose to divert my gaze. To walk past and hustle to another class where we discuss Marx and Weber and theories that purport to help me “change the world.” I can ignore the realities of that world right in front of my eyes. It would be easier. It would probably take less emotional effort. But I refuse. I, and all of us, can do better. We can stop and say hello. We can look people in the eye with the same dignity and respect we afford our friends and professors. We can learn a name, maybe four. We can tell someone ours. Shake a hand, buy someone lunch, make a friend. Listen. We can see our unhoused neighbors as fellow human beings. It is literally the least we can do. To acknowledge the folks sharing our streets is to confront our comfortable existence at this powerful institution and reckon with our inherent responsibility in fostering its community, both inside and outside the gates of the Yard. It isn’t easy. For many, popping the bubble and saying hello may require more care than a problem set, more emotional effort than a research paper. But its impact is worth it. “How are you doing today, young man?” the Spare Change vendor asks with a smile, gray beard creeping up his cheeks like the cold in early October. “I’m doing fine today. How are you?” I already know his answer. I’ve heard it many times before. He shakes his head at the ground, but his smile doesn’t waver: “I’m trying.” There’s a slight uptick in his voice. Me too. I wish I had the answers. Let’s all try harder. Matthew E. Nekritz ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Cabot House.​​​​​​​"
rice_thresher_2023_14,"ByAnonymous11/7/23 10:54pm Editor’s Note: This guest opinion contains references to sexual assault and suicidal ideation. The author was given the option of remaining anonymous in the interest of keeping their experiences private. If you or anyone you know are thinking about suicide or experiencing a health crisis, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. Last fall, I was one of the “dumb and irresponsible people” to wake up in a hospital bed after drinking an entire bottle of rum. In the midst of a panic attack, I recalled memories of my ex-boyfriend sexually assaulting me, resenting my inability to ever get closure. For some reason, I convinced myself that chugging hard liquor would calm me down. I didn’t care about the consequences. Frankly, I was suicidal and too distressed for them to matter. I started to realize, half-conscious, the terrible mistake I’d made as soon as I saw my body on a stretcher. I begged emergency medical technicians not to take me to the hospital, all the while delusionally screaming at my ex-boyfriend thousands of miles away. The next morning, I woke up with the hangover of a lifetime, with feelings of shame and dread pulling at my limbs. I had to call my mom and tell her about my $2,000 ambulance bill and my bad choices and just hope she’d eventually forgive me. You may think this is nothing like what happened to the seven hospitalized and more than 24 treated on the night of NOD. You may think that I’m a fool. You wouldn’t be wrong. But after this experience, I have to say that I am disappointed in Rice administration’s response to NOD. There is no use in shaming the alcohol issues out of our students. Administration made the choice topunishthe student body for unhealthy decisions, failing to recognize that we need toteachour community about them first. Alcohol is a drug and that drug is being misused and abused by our campus. So, this is a public health issue — and that’s what action should be focused on. The only universal alcohol education offered by Rice is some online videos students watch before matriculation. Orientation Week focuses so much on alcohol policy that new students come away with an understanding of the rules and norms, but not what it actually means to drink. Is this really adequate in educating our community on the impact of alcohol use on our livers and brains? Rice students deserve to fully understand the harsh bodily ramifications of having one too many drinks. I don’t intend to make excuses for dangerous decisions, but rather to bring up the gaps our community faces in addressing alcohol abuse: gaps in mental health resources for people struggling with substance abuse, gaps in caregiving knowledge, gaps in bystander training and so much more. The role of Rice Health Advisors, Chief Justices and A-Teams in crisis prevention must also be critically reassessed and reconstructed. Administration’s new sanctions may now discourage students from calling Rice Emergency Medical Services if their friend is at risk of alcohol poisoning and serious harm. Canceling publics does not address any of the underlying reasons behind unsafe behavior among our community this semester. It also doesn’t prevent incidents like this from happening in the future. It simply deprives us of exciting events. It is foolish and irresponsible to go beyond one’s drinking limits. Believe me, I know. I have lived and breathed the consequences, and so will anyone else who got sent to the hospital. With or without public hatred, the people who received medical care during the night of NOD will live with that shame, so I implore you to show them compassion. Everyone has had an experience with alcohol that they regret. NOD partygoers are not to blame for this Prohibition Era at Rice: deficient support systems are. We need a culture of care where wellness, above all else, is central to our discussion of alcohol. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

wildcat_arizona_2023_3,"Inside the Majestic Theatre during intermission of a Broadway performance of “The Phantom of the Opera” on Saturday, March 11. The theater, located in New York City at 245 W 44th St., will end its Broadway run of the show on April 16. For my spring break, I had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a theater dream of mine come true. I, along with my cousin and her boyfriend, traveled to New York City to watch the Broadway production of “The Phantom of the Opera,” one of Broadway’s longest-running musicals in history. “The Phantom of the Opera” was my introduction to musical theater and was what started my love for theater as a whole. My love for this musical started out with the2004 Joel Schumacher film adaptationof the musical and it culminated in seeing the production live at Centennial Hall when the touring company came toTucson in 2015. A dream amongst theater enthusiasts, however, is having the chance to watch a play on Broadway. Broadway is essentially the Super Bowl of theater. But just like many football enthusiasts, it isn’t always possible to see a game in person due to cost restraints. This was especially the case for me, considering New York was literally across the country. So, I was content with satisfying my theater pleasures locally atCentennial Hall. However, at the news that “The Phantom of the Opera” would be closing its curtains for the last time on April 16, I thought that my dream of seeing this production on Broadway was crushed. But, after a conversation with my cousin — where I half-joked about going by myself to see the show — she suggested that we both pitch in to see the musical together. After realizing she wasn’t joking, that’s when the planning began, and the saving and the booking, until finally the day had come. Surely this was going to be a magical experience. I was going to be surrounded by fellow theater enthusiasts and we would all share this communal experience of watchingAndrew Lloyd Webber’screation come to life before our eyes. We had amazing seats, Front Mezzanine, which overlooked the stage. We could see the stage so clearly and could see every detail of the actors. The lights dimmed, the orchestra began to play and I happily awaited for my life-long dream to come to fruition. And for five minutes, I was engrossed by the magic of the theater. But soon, the magic was ruined. We were approached by an usher who began yelling at us to get out of our seats. The tone in her voice was reminiscent of a parent scolding a child. At first, I was confused, wondering if she was talking to someone else in our row. But then she loudly spoke out our seat numbers and demanded we follow her to the back of the theater. Scenarios began to run through my mind. My first thought and greatest fear was that, somehow, our tickets were counterfeited. We were going to get kicked out of the theater. Dread and anxiety filled my body. Without being given a reason, we all got out of our seats and followed the usher. I remember feeling so embarrassed. I was already getting emotional when the “Overture” was playing, but suddenly I was expected to put those emotions on pause. My attention was now focused on figuring out what was going on. Once we got to the back, the usher demanded we show her our tickets. Still, we were left wondering what was going on and the usher made no attempt to clarify the situation. But soon enough, we got our answer. Apparently, a family who arrived late to the show had approached another usher stating that my family and I were sitting in their seats. Without checking their tickets, the usher trusted their word and had another usher kick us out of our seats and put that family straight into our seats. My family received an insincere apology from the usher checking our tickets. We got none from the other usher, nor were given any acknowledgment of the major inconvenience this situation had caused. The chaos didn’t end there. The usher then went to get the family out of our seats and they refused. Roughly 15 minutes had passed since the musical began and my family and I were forced to watch the performance from the aisle. This was not how I imagined my experience going. I came into this theater, excited and thrilled, but now I was sitting in the aisle feeling like a criminal even though I didn’t do anything wrong. We eventually were able to get back to our seats, but I knew that it wouldn’t be the same. While I was able to get drawn back into the musical, my mind still kept racing back to that experience and questions filled my brain. Why didn’t that usher check that family’s tickets in the first place? Why was my family immediately assumed to be in the wrong? Why did she immediately put that family in our seats before checking my family’s tickets? What about that family made them more trustworthy than us? Not even a minute after the performance ended, the ushers were all quickly rushing patrons to leave. We didn’t even have a chance to absorb the moment before we were being scurried out like cattle. While I understand that there are stresses that come from managing such a huge production, there are people in that theater that have paid thousands of dollars and traveled thousands of miles, just to spend three hours watching their favorite musical on Broadway. After returning back to Tucson and venting to my colleagues about my experience, I went to write a review of my experience onTripAdvisor. Curious to see if my experience was unique, I looked through the other reviews only to find out this behavior was common! To name a few examples, a person under the username ofKansas88wrote, “And lastly, maybe it’s that New York “rudeness” that Midwest folks were taught is NOT appropriate or maybe this is a long-standing tradition for Broadway (hopefully not , but I found the staff to be extremely and unnecessarily rude.” Another reviewer made a similar comment to the one I made about the conclusion of the show, under the usernamencbeachgirl14, “What I can’t believe is how staff became so agitated and abusive to the patrons after the play was over. “The theater is closed!” “No more pictures!” “Everyone get out!” Literally yelling and screaming at all of us.” There was even another review made by a person under the usernameIsabellatravels2000that described a similar issue to what my family experienced with another staff member. “After a mistake regarding seating, he spoke to us in a very aggressive manner and made many students feel intimidated and threatened.” Broadway as a wholestruggled to stay afloatduring the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although Broadway managed to survive, it came with costs. And as stated before, after 35 years, “The Phantom of the Opera” would be closing, mostly due to thelow-ticket sales during the aftermath of the pandemic. Even though Broadway is very much aware of how fickle this industry is and how important patrons are in keeping this industry alive, I’m shocked at the accepted behaviors of staff at these theaters. Granted, I’ve only been to the Majestic Theatre, but if the treatment I received was present at a theater where the longest-running musical was home to, it only makes me wonder how the other theaters compare. It’s disheartening to see so many people have tainted experiences because of the rude and careless manner of staff members. I love musical theater, and I’m a huge advocate for this industry, but how can theater enthusiasts be expected to continue support when it’s evident that we aren’t being appreciated? I’ve never dealt with such treatment by a local theater like Centennial Hall. All of my experiences there have been extremely positive and the staff there made the experience of theater-going as memorable and welcoming as the performance I was paying to see. How is Broadway expecting theatergoers to travel all over the world to see their productions when they can’t manage to have staff treat patrons with the most basic level of courtesy? I hope to spark a conversation about this because in no way should it be acceptable for a live theater organization as highly respected and commercialized as Broadway to sacrifice patron respect for profit, as Broadway brings in over$845 million in revenueper year. I fear that Broadway, or at least those managing the theaters in this district, have lost sight of the true purpose of theater. Until Broadway remembers how to treat patrons with the basic respect we’ve earned, I recommend all theatergoers, especially those in Arizona, to stick with attending your local theaters to satisfy your theater pleasures. Even though the Broadway performance I attended itself was marvelous and breathtaking, it’s not worth spending thousands of dollars to be treated like you’re a nuisance.

stanforddaily_2023_2,"This year, the ASSU will fund a record number of VSOs — over 130 student-led groups will receive funding to put on programming that will enrich the student experience at Stanford. Last year fewer than 110 groups were recommended for annual grant funding. All sorts of social, pre-professional, cultural, religious, athletic, and artistic groups will have their financial future secured because of the work of this year’s Undergraduate Senate Appropriations Committee. Despite this year’s record funding levels, some student groups are unhappy with their allotment. They have criticized the ASSU for denying or lowering their funding requests. The loudest criticism has come from Kids With Dreams (KWD , whose executive team recently wrote a piece in the Daily that accuses the ASSU of “disincentivizing frugality” and argues that the ASSU’s funding policies lack consistency and transparency. But here’s something you may not know about the Kids With Dreams funding debate:by being denied annual grant funding, Kids With Dreams would have been eligible formoremoney. Yes, you read that right. Kids With Dreams is a great organization that does incredible work to support our community. The ASSU does not want to defund or destroy it. Rather, KWD’s annual grant application was denied so that they could be moved to a different funding track where they would get more money. Let me explain. There are two ASSU funding tracks that student-led organizations can pursue. One is the annual grants process.Annual grantamounts are recommended by the Undergraduate Senate and Graduate Student Council before being voted on by the whole student body (the election is this weekend . Annual grants are meant to be reserved for large funding requests that exceed $6,600. The other, simpler funding track requires no vote by the entire student body; instead, these“standard” and “quick” grantsare voted on only by the ASSU and usually approved within a week. Clubs pursuing this quicker funding track are eligible for up to $6,600 a year. Each student group can only receive funding via one of the two tracks. In other words, groups receiving annual grants are not eligible for standard/quick grants throughout the year. But coming into this year, the ASSU noticed a problem. Many student groups were receiving annual grants under $6,600. This makes no sense. The annual grant process is meant for clubs whose funding needs exceed $6,600. There is no reason why student groups should be using the annual grant process if their funding needs are well under $6,600. Instead, these groups should be applying for standard/quick grants, which aredesigned to benefit clubs with relatively small financial footprints. In response to this problem, we decided to deny annual grant funding to every student group whose financial needs were determined to be under $6,600. One can receive a standard or quick grant of up to $6,600 at any one time or a series of grants throughout the year that sum to $6,600. To be clear, thisdoes not mean that the ASSU defunded these student groups. We asked these groups to switch to the standard/quick grant track, which is what they should have been using all along. In fact, switching to this trackmeans that these smaller groups could get more money than they would under an annual grant. Take Kids with Dreams. They submitted a $5,619 annual grant request to the ASSU, the amount approved last year but almost $1,000 less than $6,600. So we denied KWD’s annual grant request and instead recommended that they pursue a standard/quick grant in accordance with our guidelines. KWD viewed this as an outright defunding attempt, so they fought to get 15 percent of undergraduates to sign a petition that would allow them to put their annual grant request up for a vote by the entire student body. Since their petition was successful, KWD’s annual grant will now be voted on by the entire student body this weekend. However, KWD then sent in a second request for $7,115, which the Elections Commission ruled would be on the ballot. Whether their annual grant passes at the election or not, ASSU will support KWD in a substantial way and at a higher dollar amount than last year. Kids With Dreams was not the only group to wage a campaign against this new rule change. The Society of Latinx Engineers (SOLE has a similar story. Last year their annual grant totalled $4,793. Groups are only allowed a 7% increase year-over-year. This would make SOLE eligible for up to $5,129, far less than $6,600. Considering this, SOLE’s application for an annual grant was denied, with them being referred to the standard/quick grant process. SOLE’s leaders applied for $26,972 in annual grant funding, which violated our 7% cap. SOLE’s leaders are petitioning for more, and it is now up to the student body to decide whether there should be a hike in the student activities fee to accommodate SOLE’s dramatic spending increase. I have had the honor and privilege of serving as Undergraduate Senate Appropriations Chair this year. I have worked with a great committee who have made all of the funding that student organizations receive possible. I wish my successor in this role all the best, and I hope that the student body will view ASSU appropriations as a balanced process that supports the breadth and depth of student programming. Mark Huerta ‘24 is the Appropriations Chairman of the Undergraduate Senate. This article has been corrected to reflect that Kids With Dreams (KWD changed the amount of money they petitioned for from the amount they’d originally applied for in their initial annual grant application."
state_press_2023_17,"The Tempe entertainment district, if approved, would have a devastating effect on the surrounding Tempe community. Tempe voters should vote no onpropositions 301, 302 and 303to protect their community from further escalation of crises in affordability, sustainability and tax breaks for the wealthy. The propositions are about land use and a city of Tempe contract with a developer for a proposed Tempe Entertainment District. The district would span more than 46 acres of land and include a 16,000-seat Coyotes arena, businesses, hotels and almost 2,000 apartments. Ballots for the special election were mailed to residents on April 19 and are expected to be mailed back by May 9. Any mailed ballot that was lost, spoiled, destroyed or not received can be cast in person from May 8 through 16. READ MORE:Tempe special election for Arizona coyotes arena and entertainment district, explained The Tempe entertainment district, if approved, would have a devastating effect on the surrounding Tempe community. There are multiple reasons why voters should vote against the propositions. Tammy Nguyen, the outreach director at Arizona Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander for Equity, said she thinks the entertainment district would lead to higher housing prices and that stadiums, like the one proposed for the Coyotes, have a history of gentrifying communities. Having this development, we feel, will make things significantly worse. It’ll cost us even more money to mitigate these issues, Nguyen said. It also will, quite frankly, put more blood on the city’s hands, because come summertime, people die every single day. The developer would also make a pathetic contribution to the City’s affordable housing fund. This Coyote development, even though it’s a $2.1 billion development ... they are contributing a measly $2 million to the affordable housing fund, said Dawn Penich-Thacker, a faculty associate at ASU and organizer with Tempe 1st, a PAC and grassroots organization against the propositions. The contribution is too small, but the problem is less about making adequate contributions to the fund and more about the developments in the first place. At a time when the city of Tempe should be looking to conserve water instead of wasting it on a billionaire pet project (more on that later , the entertainment district would take from resources the community desperately needs. Lauren Kuby, a Tempe 1st leader, former Tempe City Council member and senior Global Futures Scientist at ASU, said she has deep concerns with the proposed entertainment district. The City did not conduct an environmental assessment (of the development , Kuby said. They will say, well, we don’t typically conduct environmental assessments for developments. There are other environmental impacts too, including a proposal to move a dam and increased traffic. According to the NHL, ittakes12,000-15,000 gallons of water to make an ice sheet, which will add to theenvironmental impact of hockey arenas. Meanwhile, Southwestern states including Arizona are amid a 100-year drought as the Colorado River faces a shortage. Ice rinks also use refrigerants that can damage the environment through greenhouse gases. The financial burden of the deal is shifted away from its billionaire proponent, Alex Meruelo, to the people of Tempe, who are already harmed by the proposal, through a Government Property Lease Excise Tax. The basics of it is that the arena, music venue and Coyotes facilities will not have to pay property taxes for 30 years, and the other facilities including residences, offices and hotels won’t need to pay property taxes to the city for eight years. While the properties don’t have to pay taxes, the developers pay an excise tax on products or services sold at the site of the development. Yes — that means that people who go to visit these sites will pay an extra tax on purchases made there. Meanwhile, the property owners will get a massive tax break. Dave Wells, a teaching professor at ASU and research director of theGrand Canyon Institute, said that the development will be a net drain, not a net gain for Tempe. On top of that, the development is located in a certified opportunity zone that encourages private capital investments through deferments of capital gain taxes. It’s all one big tax break and giveaway to the wealthy owner of the development company, Alex Meruelo. Meruelo owns both the Arizona Coyotes and Bluebird Development LLC. Yes, Bluebird Development LLC would be the organization that would buy the land, which is not-so-coincidentally owned by Meruelo, who also owns the Coyotes. Meruelo has a history of harming local communities. While in Glendale, the Coyotes (still owned by Meruelo had to pay$1.3 million in back taxesto Glendale after the city forced the team to either pay or be locked out of Gila River Arena, now named Desert Diamond Arena. This isn’t a history that voters should bring to the city of Tempe. In what’s becoming an alarming trend in Tempe, the development agreement was reached by the city, according to some organizers, with little awareness raised and little community input sought. The negotiated deal was first presented to residents the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and then voted on a week later. I never saw that happen in all my time on council, Kuby said. The city of Tempe, in another show of disregard for public input, approved of the South Pier development butopposedof it being put on the ballot. READ MORE:Controversial Tempe Town Lake housing development lands on spring ballot If voters approve the entertainment district, one would wonder what more publicity would have done to people’s voting intentions. I think at face value, this sounds really exciting, right? I would be excited if I heard that there’s an entertainment district coming that’ll bring in a professional sports team and businesses, said Isabel Hiserodt, a sophomore studying political science and the president of ASU Young Democrats. I would just encourage any student voters to look into it a little more because I think it seems great at face value, but there’s a lot more behind that, Hiserodt said. So, it’s crucial to ask: why is it that the city entered a contract with a much-maligned billionaire with little community input sought? Why is it that the city wouldn’t run an environmental assessment of a gigantic development in the middle of a global climate crisis that is deeply affecting the Southwest? There are many possible answers, but one thing is obvious. The city is not prioritizing the majority of its residents, who are renters, students and working-class people. It would rather prioritize a glitzy, glamorous entertainment development that is environmentally destructive and fiscally irresponsible because it’s easier to go with what those with money want than to do the opposite. Yet, Tempe voters have the final say. They should cast their ballots in opposition to propositions 301, 302 and 303, and demand that the city works to make life easier for its residents.

rice_thresher_2023_63,"ByFelicity Phelan2/14/23 11:37pm Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. Yes, this article was written by a real person. The most recent issue of the Thresher included an opinion piece about the use of the artificial intelligence technology ChatGPT in academic contexts. The article, which was generated by the program itself as a display of its writing capabilities, highlighted ChatGPT’s efficiency and usefulness for “students at Rice University who are short on time and need to quickly finish an assignment.” As Rice and many universities grapple with AI’s place in their classrooms and plagiarism policies, I want to contribute a perspective that I found absent in the original article: efficiency is not the point of higher education. If I was interested in completing all of my academic writing assignments while using up as little of my time as possible, I would simply use one of the many essay-writing services available online — there are a plethora of companies and individuals who will produce original, high-quality, unplagiarized written work about any topic you desire, often for incredibly low rates of pay. I’m a busy student. This is a resource available to me that would ease my workload and allow me to focus on other important things, including my wellbeing. Why should Rice limit students’ freedom to generate their assignments in any way they please, as long as the work gets done? The answer, I hope, is obvious: turning in work that you did not create, regardless of its originality or quality, sidesteps the fundamental purpose of our education. You are not at Rice to learn how to churn out finished products. As ChatGPT has proven, that is a role that is easily replaceable by technology and AI. You have chosen (and likely paid or been awarded a large sum of money to come to Rice because you want to push the limits of your understanding, internalize the material you’re learning, contribute original insights and grow as a student and individual. Yes, ChatGPT’s free nature makes it more accessible than online essay writers, but the end result is the same: by using it, you are depriving yourself of the opportunity to leave Rice a more educated, reflective and well-written person than you entered it. As the original article correctly pointed out, there will be times when the efficiency provided by ChatGPT is advantageous and may even eventually become the norm: cover letters, boilerplate language and automated emails will benefit from this advance in AI technology. The work you do in your Rice courses, however, is not one of those times. For many of us, the rest of our professional lives will be defined by meeting deadlines and quickly producing effective written work of limited originality or reflection. Why not, then, take college and its myriad essays for what it is: not mere obstacles to complete as quickly as possible, but opportunities to learn and grow? April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2023_83,"In January, during a run along the Mount Vernon Trail, the gleam of the marble-domed Jefferson Memorial came into view. Crossing the Potomac River and through the grounds designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, one of us — Dr. Mary K. Daly — ran up the steps to the memorial chamber. Looming in the center is Rudulph Evans’ bronze statue of our former president holding the Declaration of Independence. On the southwest wall is an excerpt from that document: “All men are created equal … endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” It was a profound moment. Dr. Daly was in Washington as the chief medical officer of mePrism, an online privacy service, for a meeting in the Russell Senate Office Building to discuss privacy in the newborn screening program. How can any of us enjoy these rights without privacy protection? In December 2022, just a month before that trip, President Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 into law. It includes the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act. Daniel was the only son of New Jersey District Judge Esther Salas. He was killed by a litigating attorney who found the judge’s home address online, posed as a delivery man, critically wounded her husband, and fatally shot Daniel. Judge Salas’ video statement, weeks after Daniel’s death, is heart-wrenching and insightful. She said, “We may not be able to stop something like this from happening again, but we can make it hard for those who target us to track us down.” Federal judges, she continued, should not be forced to “live in fear for our lives because personal information, like our home addresses, can easily be obtained by anyone seeking to do us or our families harm.” For her, the stakes of the situation were clear: “This is a matter of life and death and we can’t just sit back and wait for another tragedy to strike.” The newly-passed Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act recognizes the government’s deep understanding of the serious threats posed by data brokers and people search companies. The Act states, “It shall be unlawful for a data broker to knowingly sell, license, trade for consideration, or purchase covered information of an at-risk individual or immediate family,” improving safety for federal judges across the nation. It’s hard to imagine that anyone would oppose privacy protection that could have saved Daniel. It is also very hard to reconcile that this Act was voted into law with the knowledge that not just judges, but all citizens, are vulnerable to these risks. What about teachers, nurses, children, victims of domestic violence, service industry staff, police officers, and everyone else? On the Jefferson monument’s southeast wall is an excerpt from the president’s 1826 letter to Samuel Kercheval: “As new discoveries are made, new truths discovered … institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times.” The Founding Fathers understood the importance of amending the Constitution “to keep pace with the times.” The Fourth, Ninth, and 14th Amendments convey the rights to privacy that should be applied to the new truths of this digital age. Now more than ever, in this post-Dobbs world, we must be cognizant of how our privacy will be protected and ensured. The online data marketplace has rapidly outpaced laws, and reaped the financial benefits of this poorly regulated space. Part of the privilege of attending Harvard, in addition to claiming superiority over Yale and having dining halls that look like Hogwarts, is the gift of using our education to be the voices of the future. Harvard students must ensure our University has the correct foundation on which to build formative experiences that will guide us beyond matriculation. This necessity extends to Harvard’s ownprivacy statement, which neither of us, an older graduate of the College nor a current student, had read. After exploring the website, we felt like it buried information, requiring the reader to delve further and further through links to get a full view. Click the one listed under “Users located outside the United States of America.” You may raise your eyebrows at the more detailed disclosures regarding how Harvard collects and uses data. Open the “Read More” links and you may be surprised at how much additional content appears. If we, as members of the Harvard community, will be among those addressing privacy concerns for the nation, we must understand how personal information is treated by our own institution. The Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act has dipped its toes into the muddy waters of online data exposure. It protects very few. One of the greatest honors of being an American citizen is the belief that we are all created equal and endowed with the same unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We can start here at Harvard by making sure our privacy policies actually protect us. We can speak up and advocate for a federal privacy law that protects not just a few, but all. Dr. Mary K. Daly ’94 is the Chief Medical Officer of mePrism, an online privacy service. Noah A. Jun ’24, a Crimson Sports Editor, is an Economics concentrator in Mather House and an intern at mePrism."
state_press_2023_40,"It’s easy to throw out some stats and make the obvious conclusion that the Eagles are the better team. Let’s take it a step further. Philadelphia and Kansas City willmeet on Super Bowl Sundayin a familiar setting for Patrick Mahomes’ squad; however, the Eagles have superior talent, and Jalen Hurts will be the key to its victory. Hurts, an up-and-coming quarterback, versus Mahomes, a young and established league stalwart, is the predominant storyline. Generally, Mahomes has played better than Hurts; he threw for 41 touchdowns to Hurts’ 22 during the regular season. On top of that, Mahomes has had a higher completion percentage. However, Hurts has superior offensive talent surrounding him. Miles Sanders, A.J. Brown, Devonta Smith and a strong offensive line match up relatively well against a Kansas City defense thatwas ranked 16th in defensein the league, according to Pro Football Reference, but more on that later. Mahomes and Kansas City went to the Super Bowl in 2020 and 2021. They beat the Jimmy Garoppolo-led 49ers in the first appearance but were taken down by the Buccaneers in the second. Mahomes is alsonursing an ankle injurythat, according to him, isn’t that bad. Regardless, it’s something to keep an eye on. On the flip side, this isn’t the same Mahomes-led offense we’re used to. There’s no Tyreek Hill, and Travis Kelce has had to carry the load on an offense that lacks a true third star to complement Kelce and Mahomes. When the Eagles get out to a lead, Mahomes will have to drop back to pass against the best pass-rushing defense in the league. The Eagles sacked opposing quarterbacks 70 times during the regular season,15 more timesthan the second-best team in that category… Kansas City. Therein lies a chance to win for Kansas City. Can its defense slow down the fourth-best rushing attack in the league to the point that Hurts will have to drop back to pass on third and long, leading to sacks and potentially turnovers? It’s not impossible to imagine. If it does happen, watch out, because the Eagles were the 11th-most sacked team in the league this past season. But, it’s harder to imagine that than it is to imagine Sanders doing just enough to open up the Eagles’ passing attack so Kansas City has to throw consistently against a stellar defensive line. That’s why it seems clear that the Eagles have the advantage. It’s easy to throw out some stats and make the obvious conclusion that the Eagles are the better team. Let’s take it a step further; the Eagles have superior vibes. And, again, it starts with Hurts. “I watched the last game, and he (Hurts was still sitting on the sideline, just straight-faced, ready to go. It’s nuts to be that business-minded, it’s what you need,” said Declan Membrila, an Eagles fan and a freshman studying nursing. “I hope after they win, he might let loose a little bit, but right now it’s business because they haven’t won yet,” Membrila said. While Hurts might have a serious mentality, Eagles fans don’t, at least not in the same way. Philadelphia has famously greased its street poles before sporting events in case of celebratory pole-climbers, and the city is alreadyplanning to do the samefor Sunday night. That is, clearly, a smart move. Even if the game is close, hopefully, we ll be watching a less-serious Hurts lift his first Vince Lombardi Trophy. Then? It’s time for a celebration in Philadelphia.

thetech_mit_2023_15,"Nearly 60 years ago, a quarter-million people rallied together for the historic “March on Washington,” where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. What’s sometimes forgotten about the march, though, is that it was actually called the “March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.” Thedemands of the marchincluded an end to segregation and the protection of voting rights,alongsidean increase to the federal minimum wage and a federal jobs program to train and employ all unemployed workers. It was understood that ending poverty — with decent wages and full employment — was essential to achieving racial equality in practice. It’s for this reason that Dr. King was a strong and unwavering proponent of the labor movement and unions as the principal means for workers of all races to fight for improved wages, employment, and working conditions. In fact, he was in Memphis, Tennessee, standing alongside public sanitation workers on strike for equal pay just a day before he was assassinated. And it wasn’t just Dr. King who viewed unions as an integral part of the civil rights movement. Workers did too, organizing in their unions for months to attend the March. And one of the key architects and leaders of the March, A. Philip Randolph, was a longtime labor leader who organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, a union of primarily Black workers in the railroad industry. Dr. King’s legacy, alongside those of countless other civil rights leaders, exemplifies how the civil rights movement and the labor movement are so deeply intertwined. Dr. King understood the need to unite working class people across racial lines in order to fight back against discrimination and harassment in the workplace and beyond it. In this regard, unions have always played an important role. In 1866, newly emancipated Black women working as laundresses in Jackson, Mississippi, organized thefirst union in the state,demanding standard pay ratesthat afforded greater economic independence to assert their freedom against a continuing system of white supremacy. In the 1940s, in Louisville, Kentucky, workers in the Farm Equipment Workers unionmade interracial solidarity a priority, fighting racism in the factory as well as in the streets, shops, and parks of Louisville. In the 1950s, meatpacking workers unionized with United Packinghouse Workers of Americafought to desegregate the workplaceand end discriminatory hiring practices that excluded Black women in particular. In 1957, Dr. King wrote a lettersupporting workers unionized with United Electrical Workers(our union in their fight to end racial discrimination by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The history of the labor movement has shown that workers win the most when we are all united. And this unity is the foundation that has enabled strong unions to fight for both economic rights and racial justice. In this spirit, our union at MIT is a vehicle for economic security, to relieve the financial stress that each of us face, but also for fighting discrimination and harassment and guaranteeing protections for immigrant workers. Our union gives us the mechanism to begin addressing these issues, but we know they won’t disappear overnight. So while our immediate goal is to secure a strong contract, we ultimately cannot lose sight of the importance of building a strong and lasting union in which all workers are united. This maximizes our negotiating power to collectively improve our working and living conditions and our ability to hold the employer accountable to all graduate workers. An important element of this unity is all workers contributing financially to ensure that our union has the resources to organize, enforce, and improve upon the gains we all win together. This concept is known as union security, and is a cornerstone of strong, long-lasting unions capable of continually improving wages, benefits, and respect and fair treatment on the job for years and decades to come. The arguments against union security are often framed as a “freedom of choice,” that each worker should have the freedom to choose whether they are members of the union. But the reality is that unions without union security consistently win lower wages and fewer benefits than those that have a strong union security clause in their contract. Employers know this very well and, in an attempt to weaken unions, have pushed so-called “right-to-work” legislation that denies union security in some states (though not in Massachusetts and all public-sector workplaces.These laws have racist roots, conceived in the 1940s as a means to reinforce Jim Crow segregation, divide workers, and reduce wages, particularly for Black workers. Dr. King put it best: “In our glorious fight for civil rights, we must guard against being fooled by false slogans, such as ‘right to work.’ It is a law to rob us of our civil rights and job rights … Its purpose is to destroy labor unions and the freedom of collective bargaining by which unions have improved wages and working conditions of everyone … Wherever these laws have been passed, wages are lower, job opportunities are fewer and there are no civil rights.” Each and every one of us benefits personally from a strong union. Any one of us can face harassment, discrimination, or bullying; delays by the International Student Office; dangerous working conditions; or late pay. But having a strong union with the resources to enforce our contract will empower us to force MIT to address these issues. Union security also strengthens our ability to continue winning improvements in all future contracts. Fortunately, we, as MIT grad workers, have the right to union security in our contract. But MIT is dragging its feet. So as we fight for an empowering grievance procedure for harassment, discrimination, and bullying as well as international worker rights, health and safety, and wage increases, it is just as essential that we fight for union security in our contract. We fought to win our union because we know it’s the most effective vehicle to address our needs. Now we need to ensure that our union remains strong for years and decades to come.

rice_thresher_2023_34,"ByPrayag GordyandRiya Misra8/22/23 10:42pm Our primary goal at the Thresher has been — and will always be — to serve as a watchdog for the student body, to inform, to entertain and to criticize. As we begin our term as editors in chief, we remain dedicated to our central tenets, but we understand how much we have yet to learn. The past several months have shown the impact student journalists can have. For example, The Stanford Daily’sinvestigationinto allegations of scientific misconduct in Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne’s research prompted his resignation; and at Northwestern, The Dailyunearthedallegations of racism and hazing on the football team, leading to football coach Pat Fitzgerald’s firing. This year alone, Rice has formally shifted into a new athletic conference, announced plans to buildtwo new residential colleges, made plans to redesign theacademic quad, reset the student center project, hired anew athletic directorand seen arecord low acceptance rate. Rice is moving in a new direction — and we’re excited to report on it. We also know our commitment to honest, timely and accessible journalism is as important as ever. As many former editors in chief havesaid, our mission can be summed in one word: trust. Without your trust, our work will not benefit you. We will strive to build and retain your trust by promoting and publicizing our clear, transparent brand of journalism. Timeliness is essential across all aspects of the Thresher. A growing university requires even more attention, from daily coverage — such as this week’s breaking news about the new student center delay — to long-term investigations. One year after introducing our Special Projects team, the Thresher has dug into gentrification, abortion, student labor, athletic failures and more. Our focused investigations will continue into the new school year. Finally, we are taking additional steps to increase the accessibility of our journalism. Although we will continue to print our paper issues — crossword included — every week, journalism is rapidly shifting towards digital platforms. In that spirit, we’ve expanded our social media staff and are branching out into new forms of multimedia, online-only content. The Thresher is run by the students and for the students. We need to meet you where you stand. To those who are interested in making this difference, we invite you to join us. The door to our office is always open. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

ubyssey_2023_28,"April 3, 2023 Written byRaghav Pathak My experience with the Vancouver housing market and UBC’s housing services over the three years I’ve been enrolled here has been tumultuous. I arrived in Vancouver amid the pandemic and spent two months in first-year housing before being shunted off to Fairview Crescent summer housing. It’s a beautiful place, and I would highly recommend living there — that is, of course, if the universitydoesn’tleave you with the rising panic of not knowing whether you’re going to be homeless or not. I spent four months on waiting lists for almost every on-campus residence you could think of, and I received no offers. In rising desperation, I sent an email to summer housing requesting an extension on my summer lease so I could figure out some sort of arrangement off-campus. Two weeks (and three follow-up emails later, and in my inbox sat a short, bluntly worded email that, to make a long story short, said ‘Hell, no.’ I’m an international student from India — that’s just a short hop over the entirety of the Pacific Ocean, about 12,000 kilometres from the west coast. So not having a secure place to stay presented me with the very real threat of being homeless.That, quite bluntly, sucked. I found a place to stay in the West Point Grey area with four days left on my summer housing lease. The rent was sky-high and the unit was iffy, but it worked out. I got out of there this past year and now live with a couple of friends in a four-bedroom in the same area. My landlord’s a reasonable person, and I’m doing fine. It turned out okay. But, not everyone gets to be that lucky. The Vancouver housing market is getting increasingly more competitive and expensive. Secure accommodation is not a given, and for those who aren’t domestic students, it can be even more unsure. When you’re a continent away from the place you grew up with no real ties to a very different world, it can get scary. I managed to settle in since this whole debacle, and the city, and this university, are a little more like home to me now. But to many people, UBC is all they’re comfortable with, and all they know. It’s a haven in the vast unknown. And a major factor that allows these people to feel safe is their access to secure, affordable housing. The pandemic forced UBC to freeze its gradual increase inrentrates. However, amid growing security around the pandemic, the university deemed it appropriate to lift the housing rent freeze and hike rent up, with new rates boasting a3.5-8 per cent increase. It’s funny because the way I found out about this wasn’t even through university channels — it was anarticlefrom Global News that cited the university’s ‘deep empathy’ for ‘the affordability of education, shelter, and food,’ for its students. The tuition increase that listed a two per cent rise for all mandatory fees for currently enrolled students and a five per cent increase in tuition for all new international undergraduate students signifies none of this. Add the lack of affordable food that was protested this past year, and I find myself questioning the veracity of these statements. UBC needs to act in providing secure and affordable housing options to students living on campus. An exorbitant percentage price hike not only negates the security that the university owes to students paying incredibly high tuition but also rings alarm bells. And when you add this rent hike into the mix amid a very prevalent housing crisis that has taken BC residents by storm, you don’t get a very pleasant outcome. CTV Newshighlighted the plight of students in today’s housing climate, and it underlines everything I’ve been saying over the course of this piece. UBC is a place that houses the culture of a myriad of people who seized the opportunity to come here with incredible vigour. It lauds itself for its inclusivity. ‘Tuum Est’ roughly translates to it is yours. This past year has proven that frequently it falls to us, the people who learn and grow here to remind this university of its own motto. When you elect to drastically raise the financial stakes associated with attending university, you risk alienating the people who give you your identity. UBC is not a business model, it is an institution. And it is shaped by the people who attend it. AUbysseyarticlecited UBC’s housing action plan as “undergoing a ten-year review, with the potential for significant revisions to address the university’s growing demand for housing.” Andrew Parr, associate VP housing and community services, provided vague assurance that underlined a substantial improvement in policymaking — but he could not provide specifics, according to that article. The AMS has made its disappointment with the extent of the measures taken known. This isn’t surprising, considering Parr predicted even with 17,000 beds, there may still be gaps between housing supply and demand. With the ever-growing influx of new students coming in every year, we see a growing number of housing applicants having to deal with the fear of being displaced and potentially homeless. The AMS is unhappy with the way things are going. The student body has made its displeasure known. All that remains is for UBC to take this into consideration and take the necessary steps required to take care of the population it has invited into its vast halls. All that remains for us — those potentially impacted by this ever-growing issue, is to continue to make our voices heard. Raghav Pathak is a third-year history student. This is an opinion letter.

crimson_2023_128,"Before my sophomore year, I was terrified of deciding what foreign language to take. The idea of learning a whole new form of human communication seemed daunting. After a lot of stress and searching, I eventually landed on Tigrinya, an East African language spoken by the Tigrayan ethnic group in Ethiopia and Eritrea. But despite the loving faculty and incredible culture that I have come to know during my time taking Tigrinya, I’ve noticed that surprisingly few students enroll in the African Language Program. The ALP deserves more fantastic students in its ranks. To all current Harvard undergraduates: Consider taking a course in an African language. The African Language Program at Harvard University turns 20 years old this year. Throughout its short history, the ALP has provided instruction in more than40 languagesspoken on the African continent, offering more than 10 courses every semester that fulfill the foreign language requirement for Harvard undergraduates. These courses are essential to those specifically concentrating in the African Studies track of the Department of African and African American Studies, but also relate well to a variety of other areas of study and people on campus. There’s only one problem: Students aren’t taking these courses. Last fall, the elementary courses in Igbo and Yoruba, two of the major languages spoken in Nigeria, had less than 10 students enrolled. Introductory Swahili only had seven students, despite being a language spoken in over more than 14 countries across Africa and the Middle East. And I myself was one of only three students in elementary Tigrinya. These small enrollment numbers obscure the fact that the African Language Program is directly relevant to Harvard’s purpose. One of the missions of a liberal arts education is to familiarize students with other cultures that aren’t their own. At Harvard, it’s easy to center languages that have always been at the forefront of Western higher learning. This historical precedent is apparent in the fact that the only language placement exams Harvard centrally administers are French, German, Italian, and Spanish. But the University has become more and more diverse over the last century, so students should move away from this precedent. Harvard does not have to be a place that only values and encourages learning about Western history — it is just as important to learn about the African diaspora. One of the most unique learning experiences you will get in the African Language Program isTheater Night. Each semester, students in every ALP course are required to participate in a performance of their choosing. For my first Theater Night, my two wonderful classmates and I did a Tigrinya rendition of “Little Red Riding Hood.” It’s an event unique to the ALP that brings people together through cultural food, arts, and warm welcomes from various people in the department. Beyond Theater Night, I was taken care of in my first introductory course. As a foreigner with no direct attachments to Tigray, my instructor was patient with me. He walked me through the Tigrinya variation of the Ge’ez alphabet, a script which originated as a consonant-only alphabet that is now used for several Afro-Asiatic and Nilo-Saharan languages. Although I was going at a snail’s pace, my instructor consistently checked on my confidence in the material being covered. Before I knew it, I was able to butcher pronunciations of words, name body parts, and even tell time in Tigrinya. If you are worried about not having a connection to the culture, do not fear. You will be welcomed with care by the African Language Program. While I am a generational African American student, I also understand the extra hesitancy of white students who decide to take courses in African and African American studies. Coming into these spaces, it may feel like courses in ethnic studies are geared only toward students of their respective identities. However, white students who decide to pursue non-white language and ethnic studies are not accessing knowledge or occupying territory in which they aren’t welcome. The opposite is the case. I encourage more white students to explore, perhaps for the first time, brand new perspectives that they can learn a thing or two from. If you’re a rising sophomore on the fence about what language to take at Harvard, you should consider joining the ALP. More new students in the department is exciting, and more engagement gives the program the chance to enhance existing events as well as make way for brand new traditions. By choosing to take an African language, you are affirming that this scholarship matters. In the words of the program’s director, John M. Mugane: “A serious understanding of Africa begins with language study.” More students learning indigenous African languages, including those without prior connections to Africa, strengthens the intellectual soul of our University. Learning an African language is deeper than learning some words — it’s about broadening our sense of which cultures can nurture our development as scholars and people. Prince A.

crimson_2023_95,"Nowhere is safe. Not the yoga studio when I’m wiping down my mat beside my friend. Not at brunch before our drinks arrive. Not in a two-minute conversation on JFK Street with someone I haven’t seen in a year. All anyone seems to care about asking these days is: “What are you doing next?” Every time someone asks, my heart pounds and my mind swirls. I don’t want to let people down. So I shrug my shoulders and silently hope that the conversation will move on. But inevitably, the conversation continues and the next question is: “Well, do you have an idea of what you want to do?” I’ve gotten really good at changing the topic. For friends in the same boat as me — jobless — we can commiserate when these interactions happen. But it’s a bit awkward sharing what I’m thinking about applying for, especially when it’s with a friend who has similar interests. I’m caught between wanting to support them and being faced with the reality that there’s usually only one position available. For friends who have a job lined up or who are already working, you can see the hesitation in their eyes before they muster the courage to ask about post-graduate pursuits. Sometimes, they’ll preface it with: “Yeah, I’m not sure if I can ask, but…” In a one-on-one conversation, it’s less bad to ask. But that doesn’t mean you automatically should. When in doubt, just don’t. Especially not in front of a group of friends or another social setting. For friends in industries like consulting and banking, which recruit in the fall — on a way too early timeline, if you ask me — congratulations on your fancy-schmancy offers. I am happy for you, but please be cognizant that most people don’t know what they’re doing yet. Everyone’s on their own timeline. In fact, there is no timeline for finding a job after graduation beyond a stupid societal standard we’ve created. The assumption that you should know exactly what you want to do and where you want to be months before Commencement is an unrealistic expectation that only amplifies an already stressful time. The pressure to find a job, amongst other life things, can be overwhelming, and the question of “what’s next?” can unintentionally exacerbate that stress. Trust me, I’m aware that graduation is two months away. I know people who inquire about post-graduation job prospects generally want to help and do not intend to cause stress. Sometimes, discussing potential job options with trusted confidants or even strangers can be helpful. It can be beneficial to bounce ideas off others when I initiate them. They might say: “It sounds like you’re really interested in doing X. I know someone doing X, too,” or: “Have you considered Y? I think you would be a great fit.” It’s important that everyone has an outlet or at least feels comfortable talking about their post-graduation aspirations with someone. No one should suffer in silence. There are ways to offer support to both friends and acquaintances without accidentally shaming them for not having a job offer. Instead of asking: “What are you doing after graduation?”, consider: “What’s been occupying your mind lately?” Give people the space to share what they want to discuss, when they want to discuss it. If jobs come up, try responding: “I’m happy to act as a sounding board if you ever need,” or: “How can I help you find your ideal job?” Offering support and understanding can be much more meaningful than simply asking the question that adds to the stress and pressure already felt by students. If you slip up and blurt out the dreaded question, remember that “I don’t know yet” is a perfectly acceptable answer. Move on. If you’re really curious to know how my job search is going: It’s going. I’m applying for positions that interest me, but I’m not applying for everything left and right just to have a job — and I recognize that this approach comes from a place of privilege. I’ve also applied for a couple of fellowships, but I’ve either been rejected or I’ll find out in April. Right now, I want to make the most of my last semester. I have a thesis to write, readings to complete, and friends to see. Frankly, job hunting is not at the top of my priority list. You might not be pleased to hear this, but it’s the truth. After years of taking exams and checking Canvas for assignments, I just want to sit and breathe. A little bit of nothing can’t hurt. Rest assured, I promise that finding a job is at the back of my mind. I imagine the same holds true for others who don’t have a job yet. But in the meantime, please stop asking about it. Thanks in advance for your support. Jennifer J. Li ’19 is a second-year Master in Public Policy student at Harvard Kennedy School."
rice_thresher_2023_22,"ByYiyi YangandAriana Zhu10/24/23 11:17pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. As we approach Night of Decadence, one of Rice’s most highly anticipated publics, we find ourselves facing a concerning theme for this year: “NODie Dreamhouse: Cum On Barbie, Let’s Get NODy.” This playful twist on “Barbie Dreamhouse: Come on Barbie, Let’s Go Party,” inspired by the recent “Barbie” blockbuster, has led us to question the theme’s level of inclusion. We feel compelled to raise concerns about this year’s NOD theme due to its troubling sexist undertones. The phrase “Cum on Barbie” used in the theme fundamentally distorts the female empowerment that the movie “Barbie” aims to convey. By replacing “come” with “cum,” the phrase deviates from the original meaning, which was to extend a party invite to Barbie. Rather, it diminishes Barbie’s autonomy and reduces her to an object designed solely to satisfy the cisgender heterosexual male’s desire. Such language reinforces heteronormativity and perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes. Given that the theme was chosen through a college-wide majority vote after nomination, it prompts us to question whether the Wiess College Cabinet and members have fully considered the implications, though we believe they have no bad intentions. We understand that it can be challenging to craft an attention-grabbing theme, but we are confident that this can be done without causing offense. Looking through allpast NOD themesfrom 1972 to 2022, we noted that while many themes have sexual allusions, none explicitly objectify people based on their gender to the extent that “Cum on Barbie” does. Searching on Google with some relevant keywords, it is evident that the verb come / cum itself applies to all genders, but cum on is predominantly, if not exclusively, hegemonized — in linguistic, visual, and overall narrative terms — with a male subject and a female object. In a sense, whoever is represented by Barbie is the female object here. You might want to ask, is this issue worth thinking about that much? Are we just being too sensitive and wasting our time and energy on what might seem like a minor concern? Well, what we want to target here is not only the problematic NOD theme this year, but also patriarchal language. This language is so embedded in our daily life that we employ it without much thinking and without noticing its underlying toxicity. We hope to draw attention to the theme so that we can use it as a starting point to discuss the language we use every day and advocate for greater inclusion at Rice. Let’s not fall into the patriarchal trap, as it harms not only women, but also men and people who identify with all other genders. To promote inclusivity at Rice, a public theme that contributes to male gaze, misogyny and heteronormativity should be avoided by all means. After all, Barbie, being objectified and deprived of agency could be you or me. Wisestudents can be creative in a more inclusive way than that. We urge the Wiess College Socials, Diversity Chairs and Cabinet at large to take responsibility for ensuring a safe and respectful environment. There are many on-campus resources to help as well. Diversity Facilitators from the Multicultural Center and the Student Association Diversity and Inclusion Committee are good resources to reach out to before finalizing the theme. The Rice Women’s Resource Center and Rice Pride can also help identify problematic wording based on gender and sexuality. As we involve the Rice community in this collective reflection, let us not only consider the importance of respecting each other s body sovereignty but also acknowledge and address any potential perpetuation of a heteronormative culture stemming from the theme and beyond. Through these efforts, we aspire to foster a more inclusive and compassionate community at Rice. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.

stanforddaily_2023_100,"In September 2021, Stanford’s campus re-emerged as though born anew. Of 7,700-odd undergraduate students, only a fourth had ever experienced a full “normal” year of student life. Suddenly, they were club presidents, team captains, dorm residential assistants (RAs , each more than the last carrying all the weight of hundreds of organizations’ institutional knowledge. And so began what many students have felt to be a cultural crisis, in which the branches one could chart through campus all felt abruptly pruned. Every corner of Stanford began to see, feel, and formulate plans to address the circumstances. So a question is asked:in the midst of drastic change, how can we continue to facilitate joy and community?What inclusive, accessible opportunities for “fun” have truly been lost over the pandemic that we once had? How can we bring them back? We joined the Hillel Design Lab last quarter to explore these questions. In a small conference room, a group of us met weekly and wondered how to address “fun” from a true student perspective. We, a small group of upperclassmen, conducted peer interviews, covered whiteboards in post-its and considered the low-hanging fruit we can start doingtodayto restore student confidence in Stanford’s fun (film screenings in Memorial Auditorium? Coupon books for local restaurants? . In the discovery process, a repeated theme emerged: the feeling — and potential — in absent tradition. The concept of “tradition” is almost as complicated to sift through as differing notions of fun. Stanford traditions have long histories; many have undergone criticalchangesto reflect our developing values. Institutions, groups, celebrations have come and gone in a long-term journey to develop a campus climate in the best interests of students. But some of the traditions students have always valued have disappeared. Cardinal Nights haschanged, its presence on campus nightlife diminished from pre-pandemic years. The Band has,too. Even Lake Lagunita – full, for now — is a visible reminder of what prior generations oncehad. There are so many more student traditions that have become entirely lost to time. These traditions once did, and still can, invigorate a sense of shared community that can de-fracture social life and redefine “fun” to be something had on students’ own terms. In the past few years the idea of fun has felt like something that can be had inspiteof circumstances. Traditions turn chances for fun into a default expectation rather than something that must overcome a static inertia on campus. One tradition — part experience, part mindset — that emerged in our journey was the feeling of “Camp Stanford.” Camp Stanford can be best captured in spring Quarter weekends: sun and vibes. With awful weather in the winter quarter, that feeling was especially lost. We have a beautiful Row with big lawns and great spots for enjoying the weather. Within our little Design Lab, we thought: what if we funnel the energy of Camp Stanford into a weekly tradition on the Row? The idea eventually narrowed scope. And so begins (resumes? Farm Fridays. Starting this past Friday (April 21 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and continuing each week, rotating host houses on the Row will have their lawns open to any students to stop by, hang out, and take part in that week’s theme. Think of the Row as a temporary waterpark or Mario Kart racecourse. See the Sigma Nu (SNU guys playing Die on the front lawn or Columbae slack-lining? The ambition is to have the whole Row and campus around it unite for an organic, ground-up fun time on the Farm. Each Friday of spring quarter will bring new themes and activities. With kudos to Hillel@Stanford for their ongoing support and for providing us with the funding to get started, Farm Fridays is by and for students who want to keep fun going – this spring, and for every future frosh who wants to know they’ll find belonging. If you were one of the 200 students who joined the kickoff event at Mars last week (‘Hats and Tats’ , we had a blast and hope you come back each week. We deeply appreciate thesupportof The Stanford Daily editorial board encouraging this early success.

wildcat_arizona_2023_18,"An entrance to the Oliv Tucson apartment complex located on 900 E. 2nd St. Oliv is west of campus and is home to many University of Arizona students. In the year 2000, the average price of a home was $119,600. Today, the average cost is $416,100. That is a 247.91% increase. It is commonly known that the United States is in a housing crisis. This includes being short on homes as well as the fact that the homes that do exist are too expensive for many people. Additionally, according to PBS, the cost of rent is rising right alongside home prices. So, the cost of homes and rent are increasing all across the nation, but what does this mean? Aside from the obvious and worst-case consequence, homelessness, there is a cascade of other impacts. According to the National Library of Medicine, some of the effects include lower productivity in the workplace due to workers’ need to work longer hours and pick up other jobs to stay afloat financially. The stress related to a lack of housing can lead to physical and mental ailments as well. This issue demands medical attention which demands, you guessed it, more money. People across the nation are struggling, and the state of Arizona is no exception. As stated in the Wise Voter, Arizona is the ninth fastest-growing state in the nation. The influx of people calls for a rise in housing, however, when those homes are unaffordable, people are not left with many options. A student-geared apartment complex near campus called Aspire includes on their website that as of 2022 the UA’s main campus was “home to over 39,000 students”. The nation and the state of Arizona are experiencing a housing crisis and Tucson is feeling the heat too. Students at the UA’s living situations can be broken down into a couple of main groups; students living in campus housing, those living off campus or living at home. There are, of course, outliers. Focusing mainly on how students are impacted by the housing crisis, those living on campus and off campus are of particular interest. The cheapest dorms at the UA for shared occupancy cost $6,750 for the academic year. The most expensive dorms at the UA for shared occupancy cost $9,610. The prices for single-person dorms differ and can reach up to $14,410 for the academic year. If these dorms were paid monthly, from August to May, this hypothetical rent (excluding single rooms would be $818 on average. Apartments off campus but for students include places like Oliv, Yugo, Sol y Luna, The Cottages, etc. The cost of off-campus student living is high as well. To put these numbers into perspective, cheaper apartments in San Francisco cost around $2,000 a month, and in Phoenix the average monthly rent is $1,553. To live a reasonable distance from campus, or to live on campus, students are at the hands of the current skyrocketing prices the nation is facing. For students funding their own education, this is a big issue. An interesting caveat of student housing is that of Resident Assistants. RAs get to live on campus for free, so long as they complete their training, work their hours and fulfill their duties. While on a surface level this seems like a great gig, there are a few other factors to consider here. There is a non-traditional paycheck, and in addition, RAs can only work 10 (15 with approval hours on campus in addition to their RA job. Part of the decision to be an RA is obviously role centered, but the financial help it provides is considerable if not of equal importance. So, students can avoid the burden of high housing costs by being an RA but then are limited in other ways; this can mean socially, monetarily and time wise. Students are grateful for the RA role as well as the price of on-campus housing, but they wouldn’t be in a position of need if the states’ and nation’s housing options were affordable in the first place. Essentially, because of the housing crisis, students can resort to other solutions but this would not need to be done if housing was affordable in the first place. It is like thanking a doctor for medicine if it was the doctor that made you ill to begin with. This college campus is a version of the world students will be entering after they leave college. If an off-campus apartment is barely attainable, how is living after college going to look? Students are vulnerable in the face of the housing crisis, and their states, cities and institutions need to step up.

crimson_2023_169,"It has been said that Harvard is not fun. I can’t say I fully agree. I love my time here, and that includes my weekend evenings. Harvard is no University of Alabama — nor even Dartmouth College — but you can usually find a place to crack a White Claw or cut a rug. And when you can’t, well, at least the people are interesting. With company like theirs, a worn wooden table in a dimly lit corner of Grendel’s Den — which is, of course, every corner of Grendel’s — will do just fine. But, even from behind my rosé-colored glasses, I have to admit: Our stein does not runneth over. Harvard has a serious fun problem. It’s tough to get rigorous about this sort of thing, but it seems Harvard has a less vibrant social scene than peer schools. More specifically, it has fewer of the big, brash parties that have for decades created community among and offered release to overstressed college students. In a moment where more young Americans than ever before feel hopelessly alone — and where far, far too many are dying from it — that’s a major problem. When we talk about partying, we’re talking about the opposite of the optimizing culture that makes so many people our age anxious. It’s about the small act of resistance involved in rejecting the planned and the productive to revel with people you love. Indeed, watching people gather weekly to sway, sing, and raise their arms to the sky, you’d be forgiven for confusing parties with church (the sexual mores, of course, being an important discontinuity . If your first reaction to these words is to discard them as silly or overdramatic, then you might just be beginning to grasp my point: Even those of us who love fun instinctively resist thinking of it as worthy of serious consideration. That’s wrong. Fun is no laughing matter. It is an institutional imperative for students to be happy and socially connected. A mental health crisisfueled by record lonelinessis what happens when we act like fun is not an essential, soul-nourishing part of the human experience. So why do our fetes falter? I see two things dimming the Friday night lights. First is that the final clubs aren’t built to spread the fun. At most schools, it is institutionalized social groups — fraternities, pre-professional organizations, and the like — that are the front-line funmakers. Regularly throwing good parties isn’t easy, so it takes formal, coordinated groups to pool the resources and gather the people. At Harvard, it’s the final clubs that fill this role, but they have significant limitations. Either because they’re hamstrung by their graduate boards or because they prefer not to, only some of the clubs host parties with any frequency. Of those that do party, many bar or heavily restrict attendance by non-members. For the all-male clubs, which throw most of the parties, non-member men are persona non grata, freshmen especially so. There also just aren’t that many people in final clubs. Ina 2016 Crimson survey, just 17 percent of graduating seniors reported belonging to final clubs. Another survey, fromThe Crimson s Flyby Blog in 2013, found that final club members are disproportionately likely to be white, straight, wealthy, athletes, or legacies. Basically, the final club problem is a numbers problem. It is an unhappy accident of history that the organized funmakers at Harvard are small groups that throw a small number of parties for a small number of people. (At Yale College, by contrast, traditional Greek life handles the partying and secret societies, which have themselvesbecome more accessible, cover the hoity-toity elbow brushing. The second redwood-sized stick in the mud is administration. To the people tasked with regulating our social environs, it seems fun isn’t worth the trouble. Partying kids do stupid things, and that means danger for students and liability for the University. Meanwhile, fun figures as an abstract, distant consideration for administrators who aren’t privy to our collegiate social lives. It is this imbalance — the internality of risk and the externality of fun — that helps explain how University administrators can possibly find it acceptable tocrack down on drinkingat the Harvard-Yale tailgate or allowmidterms on Housing Day, as happened this past year on two of our most cherished days of fun. And, often, the University’s attempts to swim upstream produce perverse outcomes. It may have intended to curb dangerous drinking at Harvard-Yale; instead, it likely drove student celebration to unofficial settings lacking resources to mitigate risk. For another example, its sanctions on single-sex social organizations were intended to advance gender equity; instead, they triggereda mass die-offof all-female final clubs while deep-pocketed all-male clubs largely lawyered up. Between these failures and the effects of a mental health crisis on a campus wherewait times for therapycan exceed a month, trying to prevent fun seems a liability far greater than the debauchery itself. Even if a more fun campus were riskier, that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t want one. It would also be less risky by far to equip all students with gently lit, cushily padded, WiFi-enabled cells from which to conduct an education. But that is not a school — it is an asylum. So, would-be partiers, resist the ennui. If your organizations don’t throw parties, convince them to change that; if they do, seriously consider whether they can be bigger and less exclusive. When administrators kill the joy, let them know that you are dissatisfied. Far too much of the wonderful, capacious human experience is lost when we denominate every decision in terms of risk. Living fully is worth getting hurt. No more of this death by a thousand quiet nights — turn up the music.

crimson_2023_56,"Dearly beloved, we have gathered here today to say our goodbyes to the lost, sacred art of shutting up. Shutting up — one of those acts of basic human decency — passed away at 12:33 a.m. in Lamont Library at the height of the seemingly interminable midterm season. It succumbed to its final death throes when a mosh pit of students stormed the first floor to begin the ancient ritual of pretending that they were actually going to get any work done with their closest friends. To be clear, I have no moral opposition to this ritual; in fact, I will likely even participate in it tonight, to the chagrin of future me. The sole issue with the aforementioned gaggle of students is that they were so impossibly loud. They were a discordant choir of barely muffled guffaws, echoing high-fives, and, at their worst, full-on Andrew-Garfield-in-The-Social-Network shouting. It was clear that the students had no regard for their fellow classmates in the trenches of academic enrichment, myself included. But they are not alone in their lack of self-awareness and disregard for others. Along with the flu and making-fall-your-personality-itis, an epidemic of casual egocentrism is spreading throughout the undergraduate population, making the very idea of a Harvard community fictive. At this point, the signs and symptoms of this malady seem ubiquitous. One can hear them when almost one in five households in Massachusetts suffer from food insecurity at the same time that disparaging HUDS and the unlimited food it provides remains a staple of Harvard small talk. One can see them in the sparsely populated stands at sports games and in the way people avert their eyes when they see another student struggling with a door or a heavy package. One can feel them when one walks into the room, and nobody bothers to acknowledge their existence. Slowly but surely, one feels oneself slipping into a solipsistic world, leaving mindfulness, selflessness, and empathy at the door. What makes this world so incredibly dangerous is how it serves as a breeding ground for all-consuming ignorance. In this world, there are no feelings of discomfort when one witnesses injustice against another person, for if it has nothing to do with you, it does not even seem to exist. Here, the mental gymnastics people perform to explain why their allyship ends with Instagram likes and sympathetic nods seem to follow a communal rhythm. As all of the worst parts of ourselves are dragged to the front of our being, observing the same in others constantly reassures us that this is normal — that this is who we are. But do we have to be this way? Do we have to leave our best selves behind, allowing the community — or family — we could have been to rot away in a grave we never even visit? Thus, I call upon those gathered here today to participate in a resurrection. I want us all to look within and tell that dark, selfish part of ourselves, that annoying-kids-in-the-library part of us, to shut up. I want us to stop participating in the destruction of a community we gave so much — from our time to our blood, sweat, and tears — to be a part of. All it will take is some small changes to the egocentric mannerisms we have adopted. When you see someone you recognize on the sidewalk, smile at them. If someone is walking towards a door with their hands full, run ahead and open the door for them. If you walk into a quiet space where everyone is slowly realizing that their previous lecture did not, in fact, sufficiently equip them to handle that week’s problem set, maintain a respectful silence. It is not so hard to be better than who you were yesterday. And it’s that simple effort — of a community striving to be better to each other than it was yesterday — that makes that community a family. So, for a moment, silence your selfishness and believe. Believe that being a Harvard community could really mean something great — something always to be proud of. Believe that you could be the catalyst for the renaissance this community has been waiting for. Believe in better. Believe in shutting up.

crimson_2023_112,"In Langston Hughes’ poem “Harlem,” he famously meditates on the question: “What happens to a dream deferred?” Hughes implies that even when faced with systemic neglect, dreams attempt to “explode” forward. No obstacle of delay, regardless of magnitude, can stop one. As long as we can dream, we will pursue them. So then, it stands to reason: The only way to stop a dream is to interrupt it. Around 4:15 a.m. on April 3, the dreams of four Black Harvard students were interrupted. That morning, armed Harvard University Police Department officersraided an undergraduate suitein Leverett House in response to a false 911 call. After more than 48 hours of silence on the matter, Dean Rakesh Khuranasent an emailaround 10 p.m. on April 5 to the Harvard undergraduate body. The email conveyed a sense of trepidation within the Harvard community, noting that any incident of this kind dispenses “implications, fears, and trauma” in a way that hits close to home for a lot of students of color. For Black students, those anxieties stem from a violent history of Black dreams being interrupted. But despite this history, the word Black cannot be found once in the entire email. Although it certainly existed earlier, this historical trauma can be traced back to the Ku Klux Klan. The first iteration of the KKK was founded shortly after the end of the Civil War to terrorize minorities. Then began their night rides. The White supremacist group would ride at night, in armed gangs, raiding Black home after Black home with the sole intention of instilling fear. A message was clear: There was to be no sanctuary or retreat found in Black homes. Black families were left restless by the onslaught, staying on guard and depriving themselves of sleep for fear of violence. There was no time and no place to dream. Fast forward to the Civil Rights Movement. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963, pronounced to the whole world that he had a dream. His words helped to launch a renaissance, brimming with hope: His dream was partially realized in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But this progress didn’t stop the cycle of interruption plaguing Black dreams. On April 4, 1968, King was assassinated. At the same time, Black Power organizations like the Black Panther Party sought to create spaces for Black dreams to flourish through active resistance. However, this movement was met with the same response. Around 4:30 a.m. on December 4, 1969, 14 armed Chicago police officers raided the home of Hampton and fired over 90 bullets at a sleeping 21-year-old Fred Hampton — murdering him. This pattern doesn’t end in the 1960s. Just three years ago, on March 13, 2020, a little past midnight, at least seven police officers in Louisville, Kentucky used a battering ram to execute a no-knock raid at the apartment of Breonna Taylor. Her residence was breached. 32 rounds were fired. And in the comfort of her own home, Breonna Taylor was killed. The swatting attack that took place this past Monday was not an isolated incident — it can be strung together with a lengthy history of disturbances to Black dreams. The waking terror of having our dreams interrupted has followed us to the present. Always prevented from getting rest, overworked Black bodies grow tired. Long-term patterns of fractured sleep caused by unease have been shown to lead to adverse physical and mental health effects. The basic object of sleep has become restricted. The harm has been done. Dreams are revolutionary. The imagination spurred from rest manifests into tangible inspiration. It would not be a stretch to say dreams shape America’s reality. In fact, the foundation of America is a dream. The American Dream contends that prosperity can be achieved through determination and hard work. Yet, it is apparent that not everyone in America is allowed to dream. Time and time again, Black dreams are left unsettled. Under sheets and blankets, security should be expected, but only worry is found. The worry intrudes the mind and forces us to ask: Is the safety of my own home the next facade to fall? Let us sleep. We just want to dream. Lyndon C. Ward ’25 is an Applied Mathematics concentrator in Cabot House. Christopher D.

stanforddaily_2023_21,"We had known this day was comingfor some time. Amidst a tsunami of anti-translegislationand growing transphobia across the nation, it is not unsurprising that Stanford’s ownstudent-organized neofascist clown carwanted to get in on the action. First, we must dispel a few silly myths. Sex ismore complicatedthan asimple binary, and variation in gender identity and expression iscommonin many cultures across the world. Trans peoplehave always existed. Childrenknow their gender identity,do not transition on a whim,rarelystop,are ableto make the decision to transition and have normal levels of stresswhen allowedto transition. Doctors are not blindlyhanding out puberty blockers. Trying to convince people not to transitionis harmful. Letting trans people use the restroomwillnotleadto predators harassing women in bathrooms; on the contrary, trans people are the ones who areroutinelyharassedandassaulted. Letting trans people play sports willbenefit teams and athletes. Less thanhalf of a percentof people regret gender-affirming gonadectomy surgeries, and people who detransition most often do so because ofsocietal and familial pressure. In truth, opposition to trans-inclusive policiesis a function of latent transphobia, adisgust at nonconformitythatleans towards fascism. Policies that dictatewhich lives are acceptableandwhich are condemnedto a state oforganized abandonmentfall neatly in line with thelong tradition of eugenics in America. Indeed, calling the recent wave of anti-trans sentiment across the worldgenocidalisno exaggeration. Gender-affirming caresaves lives. Restricting access is an attack on the ability of patients, parents, and physicians to accessnecessary medical care. Trans rights are fundamentally questions ofbodily autonomy, of our right to exist in society as we are and not as we are told to be. It is at this point we would like to note that writing these lettersis exhausting. While news organizationsdebate our right to exist, while right-wing grifters try to figure outhow to interact with uswithout being hilariously awkward, we have been busy taking care of our owntime and time again. We have figured out how tonavigate a labyrinthine mazeof gatekeeping and malpractice to medically transition. No matter how dire the circumstances have seemed, we haveorganized, we haveprotested, we havedone it ourselves, we havebuilt a better world together. And we aretired. We don’t actually want to spend our free time writing letters because SCR has decided to screen a documentary that tried todupe trans people into participatingin yet another 90-minute elaboration onthe same old transphobic stupidity. Would you like to know what we mysterious and unknowable transgender beings want instead? We would like to not be murdered forsimply existing. We want our gravestones tohave our actual names.

stanforddaily_2023_99,"OnApril 28, the Faculty Senate approved changes to the honor code to allow exam proctoring beginning next academic year. The decision overrode objections from the Undergraduate Senate and would allow proctoring at Stanford for the first time since 1921. The Editorial Board stands against cheating, and we want to acknowledge that Stanford does face a significant problem with cheating among the undergraduate population. We are not going to debate over whether proctoring is the solution; we would need more data to reach that conclusion. Therefore we support the original Academic Integrity Working Group study proposed by theCommittee of 12(C12 that would investigate whether proctoring leads to more positive outcomes than harm. However, we are very concerned thatby bypassing the Undergraduate Senate’s vote, the Faculty Senate is signaling that it no longer believes the student body deserves a voice in this decision, ending 102 years of precedent of shared governance over the Honor Code. We agree with ASSU Executive President Darryl Thompson that the motion shows a“lack of good faith”between faculty and students. Some faculty may feel that students broke this trust first by breaking the honor code. Even so, the actions of some students should not be an excuse for the Faculty Senate to not engage with undergraduate students whatsoever before overriding the C12’s process forrevisionsto the Honor Code, which all stakeholders had agreed to. Both the Undergraduate Senate and the Faculty Senate have several meetings left before the end of the academic year, meaning that there is still plenty of time to engage in conversation. The forcing of this motion is therefore a disrespectful and manipulative attempt to force the Undergraduate Senate to adopt the C12’s Honor Code proposals, which the UGS nearly unanimouslyopposed. Academic dishonesty is a deeply-rooted problem that cannot be solved by surface-level revisions. Faculty in support of the motion to override acknowledge this, yet argue that proctoring is a necessary start. Without evidence that proctoring necessarily reduces cheating, or that timed in-person exams are where the majority of cheating happens, we do not believe the need to proctor outweighs the need to incorporate student voices into the decision. The Faculty Senate must deeply reconsider this troubling break from over a century of shared trust. Moreover, the very act of invoking what VPUE Sarah Church called the “nuclear option” degrades trust between students and faculty. The vetoing of a democratic decision made by the student body, albeit within the powers of the faculty senate, is paternalistic and sets a dangerous precedent for further illiberal decision-making. We strongly urge the Faculty Senate to reconsider their motion to override, which has disenfranchised undergraduates. The issue of academic integrity can only be effectively addressed cohesively, and we hope that all parties will return to the table to find evidence-based, democratic solutions.

crimson_2023_145,"It is my honor to join you at this crossroads, Class of 2023. I’ve had the enormous privilege of witnessing a new cohort of students arrive, learn, grow, and sharpen during each of my seven years as dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Come graduation, these students sparkle with possibility. They are prepared to think deeply and lead well in a uniquely difficult world. The same holds true for all of you. You all have grit, tenacity, and now, the special privilege and power of a Harvard pedigree. Today, I join you on the threshold of a new adventure. Like you, I am wrapping up a pivotal chapter in my career — my tenure as dean — and beginning another. I find myself returning to advice that has proven helpful to me, and that I hope might be a touchstone for you as well: Hold fast to your North Star. Let’s take a step back. As a first-generation college student, I rose to become the first Black female dean of a Harvard graduate school. I identified my North Star early. While studying genetics at Princeton, I recognized that I didn’t want to pursue knowledge chiefly for knowledge’s sake: I wanted to solve real-world problems. I consciously honored my desire to make a societal impact and let it guide me to where I am today. Only you know what you were put on this planet to accomplish. But I’m willing to bet that within the particularity of your passion, within the vicinity of your North Star, you’ll find an underlying desire to build a more resilient and equitable world for the sake of your own and future generations. This is a charge that resonates deeply with public health professionals. But we do not have a monopoly on it. The realities facing all of us are stark. We live in a world where a global pandemic has laid bare systemic racial inequities that are as heartbreaking as they are stubborn. A world where climate change is creating devastating new challenges, almost daily. A world that will be warmer, wetter, and more volatile, with an all but inevitable escalation in conflicts around the globe. This cascade of crises calls out for innovative solutions. We need you. And so, as you plan your futures, I hope you will think of yourselves as ambassadors for public health. Whether you become engineers or lawyers, computer scientists or dentists, pastors or teachers or writers or therapists or any of the countless other careers you might pursue, you will have an opportunity in your workplaces and in your neighborhoods to advocate for health and justice. To fight for equity and access. To shape more resilient and sustainable societies. To uphold the dignity and worth in every human being. These are the values that define public health — and they are values that you can do a great deal to advance, whatever your field. Hold fast to your North Star. Choose it consciously, and make sure it reflects your values. Let it steer what you do and how you serve. As you rise in your careers, you will encounter many different agendas and value systems. If you have that North Star, your decisions will not feel ad hoc. People will see a consistency that builds trust. And in turn, you will build a better world. I’ll leave you with two quotes. The first, from trailblazing Black tennis player Arthur R. Ashe, is one that I’ve kept on the wall by my desk for many years. It recently became the motto forHarvard HealthLab,the first accelerator at the University focused on nurturing student startups geared toward social impact. HealthLab has attracted students from a broad range of disciplines. Ashe said: “Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.” For us, these words resonate as a collective North Star. If you find that this motto fits for you too, use it. The second quote comes from Chester M. Pierce ’48, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Medical School who went on to have a stellar career in psychiatry. “The greater virtues are wisdom, justice, and intelligence. Lesser virtues are qualities such as gentleness, kindness, cheerfulness, joy, and gratefulness,” he observed. “Now I am coming to the view that the lesser virtues in fact are ancestors and commanders to the greater virtues.” I offer these two wonderful touchstones to you, along with my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes. Michelle A. Williams is the Angelopoulos Professor in Public Health and International Development and the Dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health."
ubyssey_2023_45,"Jan. 20, 2023 Written byShanai Tanwar Part of the charm of a university like ours (for a social butterfly like myself is how big it is, with over 60,000 faces trudging sulkily under umbrellas during the gross rainy months. But, also part of the issue is that thereareso many people, and despite what probability would tell you, you somehow find yourself running into people you want to avoid all the time. Unlike what Effie Trinket said inThe Hunger Games, the odds are not in our favour. As if this series of unfortunate events wasn’t bad enough, if you find someone you want to kiss, cuddle or hold hands with all the time… get ready to be seen everywhere.Unlesssomebody (IDK, maybe me! gave you a slight tip on where to avoid the crowds. I’ve recently found somebody who is willing to deal with my insanity all the time — voluntarily (I have a boyfriend ! So, now that I have field experience with showing him around campus, I knew I had to list some verified PDA-hotspots for youlove birds to nestin too. Okay, it’s late Wednesday night and things got spicy at The Pit. On the walk home, the vibes get a little exciting, and you think “fuck it, where do we go now?” Enter: The North Parkade, arguably the best thing to come out of the area near Walter Gage Residences generally. People hate Gage so much, they literally park their cars and bounce out of there like their lives depend on it. This happens to be fortunate both for PDA-seekers and the raccoons who live there. Once you get past how damp it is (bonus points if you actually have a car, but don’t drive after drinking at The Pit! , the parkade is actually pretty quiet and so unnecessarily labyrinthine that I guarantee you, you’ll find some privacy. Personally, I can’t recommend this one enough. Not only do virtually no students go here because of how far it is from central campus, but you’ll also probably only see some cute dogs and other couples like yourself. If you’re looking for a sweet little walk through a pretty park while holding hands with someone, this is the place for you. Seriously, it’s devastatingly underrated for how beautiful it is, and being away from other students means less chances of running into someone you know… right? Yes, I’m being cliche, but that’s EXACTLY the point! Because the expectation is to be cute and cheesy at the rose garden (where people literally have weddings , you get a free pass for some PDA. For sunsets and snuggles, this pretty slice of campus is ideal for simps like me and you. And even if you run into someone you know, so what?

rice_thresher_2023_59,"ByHamza Saeed2/21/23 10:17pm Last week’s issue of the Thresher included aletter to the editorthat discussed the use of ChatGPT by Rice students. Felicity talks about how the reason we came to Rice was “to grow as a student and individual,” and I believe that in this regard, they are absolutely correct. Where she errs is when she implies throughout the article that this growth and intellectual stimulation are completely incompatible with the use of ChatGPT as an online tool. She is most certainly not the only one who holds that view. Many professors at Rice and across the world are currently grappling with how to handle the rise of A.I. I firmly believe that ChatGPT does have a place in academia and that the vast majority of Rice students are using ChatGPT in a positive manner that actually contributes to their educational pursuits. To initiate any defense of ChatGPT, it is important to look at what the software can really do. ChatGPT is an A.I. software that generates outputs based on online templates, writings and articles in response to user prompts. ChatGPT scours the web for works that are related to the given input, and then, regardless of the veracity of the information it cobbles together, presents it to the user for judgment. As soon as instructors create prompts or assignments that actually challenge a student and force them to expand their thinking (i.e. assignments that are not simply “busy work” , ChatGPT struggles significantly with providing an adequate response that can just be dropped into a Canvas submission. As such, assuming that these assignments allow for the use of online resources, I fail to see how using ChatGPT to highlight new ideas and concepts from across the web means that a student has cheated themselves out of the learning process. Fundamentally, what is the difference between me searching up research articles and writing templates to help me develop an argument and asking ChatGPT to round up those resources and present them to me? If I were to clearly cite my sources and provide my own interpretation of the information that I find, I do not believe many professors or students on this campus would find ethical issues with online research, so why should they find issue with the use of ChatGPT? Despite this apparent contradiction, or perhaps in spite of it, many individuals have made the point that turning in work that you did not create is in conflict with why we all decided to pursue higher education. This argument’s fatal flaw, however, is that it hinges upon the assumption that Rice students are directly submitting outputs, as well as the fact that it seems to be a subtle insult towards students: their work somehow wasn’t honest or had no effort behind it because they made use of an online tool. Call me naive, sure, but I do sincerely believe that most people here at Rice do want to present their own work and put in a lot of effort to submit things that they themselves are proud of. There does seem to be a lack of nuance in these arguments where you are either completely working from scratch and actually learning the material, or you blatantly and unethically plagiarized someone else’s work. To be clear on where I stand, I absolutely agree that online essay writers are inherently unethical, no matter what the circumstances are. Taking someone else’s writing and completely passing it off as yours is, to put it simply, wrong. But drawing a parallel between that and the utilization of ChatGPT when professors permit online resources is, in my opinion, a vast oversimplification and a position that fails to recognize the differences in how a resource can be utilized. Going forward, I hope to see an integration of new technologies in the academic space. Instead of shaking our fists in the air, Rice should put some serious thought into the best way that tools like ChatGPT should be integrated into our curriculum. Should we get rid of busy work, weigh presentations and exams higher than essays or even bring ChatGPT directly into the classroom? Quite frankly, I don’t have an answer for you, but I am confident that we, collectively, can figure it out. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2023_76,"We don’t need to tell you do we? Because you feel it — every time you walk around without your close friends or without your AirPods in. Do you feel welcome everywhere on campus? Do you feel like Stanford has a strong sense of community? Universities have personalities by which we know and love them or by which we are disillusioned. The personality of a university is far more than the aggregation of the professors, buildings, books, and laboratories found on the campus. The Spirit of Stanford is as real as the buildings and books and is far more important. We are asking, “What is the state of the Spirit of Stanford? The hard truth is that we are at a school with a $37 billion endowment where we have to campaign for “Fun to Strike Back.” The administration has as its goal the total re-creation of campus social life, a rather muted conception of the Spirit of Stanford, from the top-down. They will throw money at the problem, establish more offices and more advisory boards. They will change the fine print of the rules and regulations for throwing parties, and they will bombard you with facts that demonstrably prove all is swell. But we believe that a thriving campus social life emerges naturally when everyone feels like they belong to one family; it cannot be bought. It is our responsibility to bring about the change we want to see, from the bottom-up, one interaction at a time: Saying hello is the heart of community. “The “Hello Spirit” is the backbone of the Farm, welding unbreakable bonds of friendship. It is the “Hello Spirit” that gives you a glow of pride when you see a Stanford sticker in Nome, Buenos Aires, Cape Town or Bombay. It makes you seek out the owner of the sticker and have dinner with him, even though he may be in the class of ‘98 while you completed your 180 units 25 years later. After dinner you’ll almost certainly drink a toast to the Farm and to the “Hello Spirit” you learned there.” Does this sound like a fantasy? Well, we didn’t write this.Thiswas taken from an article in the 1937 Stanford Daily. The class of ‘98 alumnus mentioned is from the class of 1898. Let that sink in. Stanford students, you are not passive to the whims of the Orwellian neighborhood system. You affect those around you through every interaction. You have influence over those who will take your place. And so you have great responsibility. In years to come, there will be frosh whose conduct and character will be shaped for the better (or the worse by the college spirit you help to create. It is unfortunate that in the wake of the pandemic, Stanford has lost many of its cherished traditions. Bay-to-Breakers demonstrates how much student solidarity tradition can foster. But we also realize that many of Stanford’s so-called traditions are highly problematic. Full Moon on the Quad does not appeal to us anymore, nor, it seems, to anyone. The fortunate loss of Full Moon on the Quad and more unfortunate decline of countless other micro-traditions — saying ‘Happy Birthday’ to tour guides, running Stanford-to-the-Sea, eating FroYo at the CoPo — is no reason in itself to abandon the worth of tradition altogether, nor a reason to write off the wealth of heritage and wisdom about how to foster community that the history of Stanford offers. We hope that some of you reading this will take pride in Stanford’s “Hello Spirit” and bring it once more into being. Readthis: “November 19, 1928 Since the University started in 1891, the most cherished custom has been embodied in the “Hello” spirit. Of late, however, we have been wondering whether this is not another vestige of the good old days which will go the way of other Stanford traditions. It is not pleasant to walk about the campus and have a cheery “hello” met with a half-hearted grunt or no attempt at reply. Excuses that one is not sure of the person’s acquaintance are offered, but the “hello” custom applies to non-acquaintances as well as acquaintances.” Our greatest challenge now is to revive the oldest tradition of the Farm. If you read this whole article, go say a hearty hello to someone, anyone. It’s on us to make this our family. In practice, what does it mean to belong to the Farm Family? It’s holding the sincere belief that you can make a lifelong friend while toasting a bagel in the common room. So, if you want to do something about Stanford’s social life, do this: Say hello! Say hello in the hallway of your dorm. Say hello before class to your classmates. Say hello while biking through the quad. Just say hello. Leopold van den Daele ’24 and Matteo Perper ’23"
crimson_2023_17,"Hamas’ horrific terrorist attacks on Israel and Israel’s brutal ongoing assault on Gaza have opened emotional wounds and divided our community. We must not make matters worse by creating an atmosphere in which vulnerable students are demonized by those in power, afraid to share their opinions, or fear for their safety. We do not support thejoint statementwritten by the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee, which held “the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” Indeed, we are quite critical of it. Whatever one’s view of the roots of Hamas’ terrorist attack, the statement was horrendously timed and, in failing to recognize the massive toll in human lives and profound grief the attack brought to so many members of our community, displayed a troubling lack of empathy and compassion. An explanation without condemnation can be perceived by critics as justification. But two things should be made clear: First, the statement did not endorse the terrorist attack, Hamas, or the use of violence. And second, the statement wasnot antisemitic. Harsh criticism of Israel should not be conflated with antisemitism. That conflation can stifle debate and silence critical views. What the PSC statement did do was present a position that many people strongly objected to. Individuals have a right to object to the PSC statement. But no one should be punished for dissenting views. For this reason, we are deeply troubled by powerful individuals’ public attacks on the students, often based on a misconstrued reading of the statement. A prominent former University President fanned the flames of anger andpressured University leadersto condemn the students. A local congressman accused them of antisemitism and, sounding more like a social media troll than an elected representative, called their statement “morally depraved.” Hundreds of Harvard faculty members used their collective professional weight to call upon University leaders to condemn what they described (in our view, inaccurately as the students’“condoning” of Hamas terrorism. It was certainly not the intent of these faculty, but their and others’ actions helped create an environment of threat and intimidation for members of the student groups that signed the original statement, including targeted harassment,doxxing in Harvard Square, promises by prominent business leaders toblacklist themfrom future employment, and even reports ofdeath threatsagainst students. All the while, many of these students were living with the knowledge that their friends and families face an increasingly horrifying situation in the Middle East. The actions of anonymous internet trolls and media provocateurs are to be expected. The same cannot be said for congressmen, former University presidents, and billionaire CEOs who use their clout to silence and potentially endanger these students. In our view, these attacks by powerful people within and outside our university showed a disregard for pluralism. They failed to recognize that members of our community come from different backgrounds, have different life experiences, and hold legitimately different beliefs. All of these factors have helped create an atmosphere in which our students feel not only that they have been denied the right to speak their views but that their lives and careers are threatened. This is especially troubling when the target of these attacks is a small and vulnerable population within the university. Many Palestinian and Muslim students, groups that already often feel alienated, now believe that Harvard is openly hostile to them. We believe the students made a poor choice. But those of us with powerful positions and years of experience should use a mistake as a teachable moment, not an opportunity to intimidate. Why not counter what is perceived as offensive speech with more speech by engaging in dialogue to seek a deeper understanding of points of difference and agreement? It is incumbent on us to recognize the humanity in all people, especially our community members. Recognizing this humanity means we acknowledge that people make mistakes, come from different backgrounds and perspectives, and share common grief and even anger when violence befalls people we love. As a university that values the diversity of its student body, we must take special care to protect vulnerable students. We can all recognize that when violence occurs, it may touch some of us very deeply. For both Palestinian and Israeli students at Harvard, this is an experience with which they are tragically familiar. These students need our support and protection. For faculty members and others with the privilege of a large platform, offering an open ear, a supportive presence, and perhaps guidance on the best way to express ourselves during difficult moments, may be a healthier way to support our community. In our view, the students were misguided in the release of their statement, but they were not wrong in seeking a deeper discussion of the roots of Israeli-Palestinian violence. That discussion will require a mutual recognition that members of our community have different — and legitimate — perspectives that are informed by profoundly different life experiences. It will require recognition that terrorism like that committed by Hamas is never acceptable; but it also requires recognition that this violence occurs in the context of decades of dehumanizing occupation. None of this is easy. But reasonable people can debate the roots of violence and conflict. And as a university that claims “Veritas” as our goal, we should be working to create the conditions in which such a debate is possible. If thoughtful discourse cannot prosper here, where can it?

crimson_2023_153,"Two years ago today, I was brainstorming my Harvard supplemental essay. I turned to Frederick Douglass’s “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?” speech to fully grasp the meaning of this holiday to me, a descendant of slaves. ForGenerational African Americans, it is hard to celebrate the Fourth with fanfare when the independence it symbolizes is deeply linked with this country’s history of slavery and oppression. This Fourth of July, I am shaken by the irony of my supplemental essay. Less than a week ago, the Supreme Court ruled thatHarvard’s race-based admissions practices are unconstitutional. Generations before me gained access to a wealth of educational and professional opportunities due to affirmative action. I am no different. The ruling is an insult to the story I told in that essay. My essay concluded by recounting a transformative realization: Our community has prevailed despite an utterly painful history in this nation. For many Generational African Americans, grief is a deeply familiar feeling on this day due to its entanglement with slavery. The Court’s decision is yet another reason to grieve. Today, I grieve because I am pessimistic about how this decision affects the future of Black communities — Generational African Americans and beyond — on campus. I expected the decision to play out this way; likewise, many affinity groups have been preparing for this result. Yet, I still struggled to regulate my emotions when I read the ruling. The hours and days that followed were overwhelming, as my phone blew up with emails from Harvard and messages from clubs, peers, and others who thought to send me the news. I so badly needed to be on campus with my community to process the news and care for each other. Yet thinking about the value of our diverse community has also proven a challenge, because this decision could cause vast changes to the Harvard we are used to. The reputation Harvard carries and its relevance for higher education nationwide are powerful. It has been unsettling to watch my school’s direct loss in a Supreme Court case with such strong racial implications. And it’s been even more unsettling to be one of those “Black students” the nation is discussing. I’ve felt beyond frustrated and uncomfortable as our realities have become a trending topic on social media and a headline on the national news. When thinking and planning for the future, we cannot forget about the student body, especially those most directly affected. Many Black students and applicants are trying to process and heal from the implications of this decision, and I hope our administrators and student organizers prioritize the safety and comfort of Black students on campus over political agendas. Though I keep hearing that the future is unknown, I grieve today because the future is predictable. In Justice Sonia M. Sotomayor’s dissent, she finds that “eliminating the use of race in admissions ‘would reduce African American representation … from 14% to 6% and Hispanic representation from 14% to 9%.’” She also notes that we have seen changes in admissions like this before. When California prohibited race-conscious admissions in public universities in 1996, underrepresented groups such as Black students experienced a drop in admissions by 50 percent or more on some campuses. These are devastating effects, especially because Black students already made up less than 10 percent of the freshman class at the University of California, Berkeley, — and similarly, around 15 percent in Harvard’s freshman class today. So I am terrified, in particular, for my Generational African American community. This demographic may be only 10 percent of the already underrepresented Black population on campus. Our community is a minority within a minority, and to imagine a future where these numbers could drop even lower is genuinely scary. I cannot help but sit with a message I read that said some affinity groups within the Black community might not survive such a substantial drop in Black representation. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s ruling, we’ve often focused on admissions, but I worry about what happens after, too. Harvard’s vibrant and diverse Black community attracted many of my peers to choose it over other schools, and I wonder whether this decision could lower the amount of Black students who even want to call Harvard home. On this Fourth of July, two years after I pored through Douglass’s words, I think about the damningHarvard’s Legacy of Slavery reportand how the Court’s decision represents yet another moment of grief and discomfort for the Generational African Americans on this campus. I always tell people that my favorite part about Harvard is the people. The unique stories, backgrounds, and experiences that make each student themself are the most fascinating and enjoyable aspect of this school for me. I sincerely hope that Harvard remains committed not just to diversity but to the well-being and requests for progress from its Black students. Zion J.

stanforddaily_2023_60,"Stanford is again in newspaper headlines. Most notably, The New York Times recently published acolumntitled “The War Comes to Stanford,” highlighting students’ speech, banners and chalk messages around campus. Otheruniversitieshave been under as much, if notmore, scrutiny. This is not a new phenomenon; college students’ reactions to current events have long stoked heated debate. As a Board, we are grateful to attend university in a country with the greatest free speech protections in the world. That scope of freedom includesthe expression of beliefs that we may consider immoral, inflammatory or even factually incorrect, all in the shared interest of our own speech not being silenced for these very reasons. We are also fortunate to be under the leadership of President Saller and Provost Martinez, who have come out strongly indefenseof free speech within both legal limits and Stanford community guidelines — despite strong opposition from some. The alternative to ban, condemn or censor such speech would make Stanford the arbiter ofacceptablespeech, which is not a position that any leading research institution should take. Vindictive retaliation to students’ political expression can dampen free speech on college campuses. To be clear, we do not believe that college students deserve any sort of special pass to speak without facing the associated consequences. However,students should not receive threats to their safety on the basis of their opinions. We believe that being held accountable means that our views may — and should — be questioned and criticized. Our ideas may be lambasted; they may be called unacceptable and disgusting.But recent years have seen targeted efforts to punish students by exposing personal information such as their email and home address, opening the gateway for online harassment and physical danger. These includedoxxing trucksparading the names and faces of college students who voiced strong opinions on geopolitical issues, Turning Point USA’s “Professor Watchlist” which includes undergraduate students,harassmentof student journalists anddoxxing campaignsagainst professors and alumni. Such attacks do not constitute engagement with someone’s ideas, but rather an attempt to humiliate and punish those who take staunch stances on social and political issues. It is these threats — especially when issued by those who wield the power to realize them — that chill speech, as students rightfully fear for their safety andfuture prospects. As a college student in this environment, is it better to be silent or to test your ideas? Either choice seems unacceptable according to social media, yet at least silence carries less risk. But our country’s educational institutions should be incubators of ideas, which requires us to engage with a diversity of interpretations. Students should be free to challenge and contradict their peers’ views, and even their own. This is how we learn about the world with nuance, change our minds and reinforce our beliefs. Some may say that such a view is nice in theory, but dangerous when words hold so much power to stoke hatred. It is undeniable that the modern world exists in a continual war of information and the presentation of that information. We must each acknowledge the weight of that responsibility: that our words have the real ability to harm and misinform others.Incitementthat is likely to produce violence is, of course, unacceptable. Despite these risks, the alternative of a quiet campus is far worse. As the Supreme Court has held over the ages, we must preserve a free market of ideas so that the best ones may prevail through trial and scrutiny. If we fail to do so, instead choosing to silence the voices of our opponents out of fear that their views will overwhelm ours, we will have lost all faith in our peers — and the future of our country.

crimson_2023_40,"Last year, as a freshman with no research experience whatsoever, I had the privilege to join a Harvard-affiliated laboratory. I was accepted with kindness, and ever since have received some of the most valuable knowledge and experience of my life. This involvement has only strengthened my dream of pursuing a career in scientific research, whether academic, medical, or industrial. However, it has only been possible because of the accessibility of undergraduate research here at Harvard. I have good housing and good financial aid, enough to keep my current research an informative and enjoyable addition to the college experience. However, both at Harvard and beyond, graduate students largely do not have this same privilege of pre-provided housing and financial aid good enough to sweep away worries about costs of living. In one study, across a sample set of 178 universities, only 2 percent provided graduate student salaries above the local cost of living. Another survey showed that at the University of Arizona, over 80 percent of around 2,500 graduate students reported financial stress. Further, per arecent Crimson article, the Harvard Graduate Students Union is demanding for better wages, as even here salaries for student researchers do not reach the living wage of Middlesex County. As a Harvard undergraduate, being involved in research is common. Professors and principal investigators are everywhere and willing to take students under their wings. Harvard College prides itself on undergraduate research, hosting numerous fairs and programs, and emphasizing its importance in multiple ways. As a College student, it seems as if everyone you know is involved in some sort of research, whether it be in the social sciences, biochemistry, or astrophysics. As students, we are involved and passionate, free from the financial burden that future decisions to pursue research inevitably bring. And for those of us who decide that academic or clinical research is our calling, these largely positive experiences will in all likelihood skew our perceptions of what our futures might entail. Of course, not every college offers the same financial support as Harvard does, so these skewed perceptions may not represent the undergraduate experience beyond our bubble. Undergraduates struggle nationally, both from high tuition costs and lack of readily available housing. Therefore, other college students may have better gauges for the struggles of graduate school, making them less likely to pursue it. This could add to the larger problem of graduate school elitism, in which graduate students disproportionately come from affluent backgrounds. However, this isn’t just an issue of equity; it’s also an issue of research quality. Until our graduate students begin to receive livable salaries, research progress will suffer. Students will likely lose the excitement they once held for their research, as well as the ability to focus concretely on their topic of interest. They’ll take up side jobs, and time researching will begin to feel like shifts at any other job. Innovation will stall as students fight to feed themselves. Research will not be difficult because of the seemingly impossible and exciting questions, but because of the lack of support given by supposedly prestigious programs. If Harvard wants to support its students, then it needs to support all of us. The difference in accessibility between undergraduate and graduate research is stark enough to make one wonder how these two experiences can fall under the control of the same university. I am not arguing that us undergraduates suddenly disregard our enthusiasm for research and embrace pessimism. Excitement is good and necessary. Research thrives off of excitement. Rather, I want Harvard to take a look at their thriving undergraduate research culture, and ask themselves why they cultivate this love and passion in their students only to funnel them into years of graduate research at unlivable salaries. Improve the standard of living for graduate students, and who knows, maybe we’ll have the next Nobel Prize-winning discovery on our campus. April S.

crimson_2023_104,"Over the past decade, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has quietly charged ahead with a slate of progressive improvements to student and employee transportation benefits. To deliver on its sustainability and climate commitments, MIT has made public transit completely free for employees and introduced large discounts for Bluebike memberships and MBTA passes for students. Meanwhile, on this side of Cambridge, transportation benefits have stagnated or actually gotten worse. Harvard still doesn’t subsidize transit passes at all for undergrads, and the University-wide Bluebike discount has actually shrunk since 2013. As a result, MIT students and employees enjoy superior benefits that enable convenient, sustainable commutes and travel around campus. MIT students, for example, have access to more affordable Bluebike membership pricing ($45 vs. $98 at Harvard and bigger MBTA pass discounts (50 percent vs. an average of approximately 14 percent at Harvard , along with a more expansive shuttle network. The disparity is no less dramatic for faculty and staff benefits: MIT has long offered completely free MBTA passes to all employees along with bike commuter benefits that are more flexible than Harvard’s. MIT is practicing what it preaches when it comes to institutional climate policy. Unfortunately, Harvard cannot say the same. Our institution’s inaction undermines the credibility of its commitment to protecting the climate, leaving our neighbors in the community worse off in the process. Transportation benefits that reward riding public transit, walking, and cyclingreduce car use and steer people towardsmore sustainable transportation options. The livable communities that prioritize these non-driving modes tend to behealthier, safer, more affordable, and more beautiful. In the absence of useful transportation benefits, students and employees are destined to stay reliant on cars. Indeed, in 2022, the percentage of Harvard commuters coming to campus via car was higher than it ever was before the pandemic. This is a failure that is well within the Harvard administration’s capacity to correct. It seems, however, that they currently lack the will. And positive steps from Harvard could go a long way. Employees and students in Massachusetts face skyrocketing housing costs so severe that many aregiving up on the region altogether. Policies encouraging walking, cycling, and transit use would mitigate the effects of the cost of living crisis by increasing the geographic area in which affiliates can live and still participate fully in campus life. Harvard’s tremendous power in Cambridge and Boston comes with an obligation to act in the interests of the broader community. The City of Cambridge hasmoved aggressivelyto prioritize progressive transportation policies that make low-carbon, safe, and affordable travel possible. Harvard’s inaction, in addition to depriving its own affiliates of necessary benefits, flies in the face of these community efforts. So, why hasn’t Harvard, an institution thatclaims addressing climate change is core to its mission, taken more decisive steps? Inaction on transportation benefits, unfortunately, seems in line with the track record of the Office for Sustainability, which still hasn’t provided an update to the 2015–2020 climate plan thatlapsed without a replacement two years ago. Transportation benefits, however, are an area where the University can make targeted, swift changes to policy in the near-term. The success of MIT’s program settles the question of feasibility. Harvard’s decentralized administration might be a hurdle to implementation, but it’s not an acceptable excuse for inaction. If Harvard’s outdated organizational structures leave it helpless to address twenty-first century challenges, the structures must be changed. What should Harvard’s action look like? MIT has laid out a compelling blueprint, which Harvard should emulate. But Harvard should go further. Harvard should provide fully subsidized MBTA passes for all employees and students, taking advantage of a program allowing institutions to pay after the fact for trips taken by affiliates. It should also integrate Charlie Card technology in all Harvard ID cards, not just those of undergraduates. But the T isn’t convenient for all commuters. Harvard should provide fully subsidized Bluebike memberships and invest in more stations to increase capacity and bolster the campus network. The University should also stop forcing employees to choose between bike and transit benefits, and expand shuttles to include thoughtful services like MIT’s grocery store and airport routes. Finally, Harvard should be more willing to take bold action at the University level. The current lack of a University-wide policy requires 13 schools to evaluate transportation benefits separately, which is inefficient and confusing. Developing sustainable transportation policy at the University level will maximize the leverage that Harvard s scale provides. Administrators can and must act on each of these recommendations immediately. If Harvard begins the next academic year without a renewed set of sustainable transportation policies in place, it will suggest deep administrative dysfunction and lack of a meaningful commitment to the climate and to Harvard’s neighbors in the community.

crimson_2023_6,"You’ve probably heard it before. It’s commonly said that there are three topics one cannot broach in conversation: religion, politics, and money. I have a confession: I am a repeat — if not serial — offender when it comes to one of them. While I do not blab, unsolicited, about a Swiss alps vacation, or talk my problem set buddy’s ear off about abortion, I do talk about religion. And not just with people who know me well. Why, by a month into the semester, did everyone in my PSY 1 section know that I am an Orthodox Jew? Why do I have a compulsive need to alert the people around me to my religious identity? It boils down to a few reasons. Sometimes, the situation just forces me to explain my practices to avoid confusion in the future. Several times during the week leading up to Halloween, people would ask me what my plans were for the holiday, and I felt the urge to describe my religious identity in response to questions like “What are you doing for Halloween?” (answer: “nothing” . No matter the week, I cannot work or answer any texts for the duration of the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest. So I always know that when a group project is assigned, I must soon explain that although it may seem like it, I am not ghosting my partners for 25 hours each week. In some cases, I feel like I need to tell people that I am religious in order to avoid embarrassment or exclusion. While the people around me talk about their favorite Jefe’s orders — which I have never tried because they are not prepared according to Kashrut, the specific dietary and food preparation requirements of Judaism — I feel an urge to justify my lack of participation. “It isn’t that I live under a rock,” I want to yell, “or that I don’t like Mexican food! I just can’t eat at Jefe’s!” These are cultural phenomena, woven into the fabric of a typical college student’s life, that I am clued into but will never be able to experience fully. My observance of the Sabbath and Kashrut will always dictate my lack of participation in many conversations about Friday night football games and bad dining hall dishes. Harvard’s dining halls, in particular, are designed to breed friendship and a sense of community. When the only foods in the Lowell House dining hall that I can eat are microwave meals, fruit, and cereal, I am hardly spurred to show up three times a day, meaning I lose out on auxiliary social benefits. Similar phenomena occur almost daily, guaranteeing that the quintessential Harvard experience will always be out of my reach. However, inconveniences notwithstanding, the majority of the times in which I bring up religion in public are because of my unabashed identity as a Jew. I take a tremendous amount of pride in the way my identity distinguishes me — kosher food, special mode of dress, holy day observance, and all — and makes me feel fulfilled. I mention my religious affiliation in conversation when it arises, not out of a sense of duty, but because I wish to. Before Harvard, I was introduced to the philosophy of “Halakhic Man” by Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, in which he argues that the legal and ethical principles of Judaism should govern every aspect of a Jew’s life. I grew up in a relatively insular religious environment, where I attended school and associated almost entirely with other Orthodox Jews; the way of life that Rabbi Soloveitchik described was almost a given. However, at Harvard, the halakhic lifestyle governed by Jewish law and tradition is anything but spoon-fed. I spend hours of my day praying and studying religious texts, trying to uphold myself to the standards that I hold dear. The practices that take up so much of my time are things that I care deeply about, and they naturally bleed into my social and academic life. I could note the connection between the Book of Esther and Arabian Nights — both involve an insomnia-ridden king who cycles through hundreds of suitors — to myself, but it is much more satisfying to do so aloud in section. When asked in an icebreaker what I do for self-care, I could say I was working out or spending time with friends, or I could mention the 25-hour period each Sabbath in which all of the distractions of my day-to-day life melt away. Time and time again, I reveal my Jewish identity to the people around me, gaining a bit more confidence in the confession each time. Judaism values the concept of a “Kiddush Hashem,” literally translated as “sanctifying God.” It refers to behaving in such a way publicly that people around you recognize that positive actions you perform are due to your religious identity. My teachers and mentors have told me that my existence as an Orthodox Jew at Harvard is a living example of this philosophy. My Jewish life on campus isn’t just the moments of impassioned spirituality, but also those of alienation. I would like to suggest that this idea bears greatly on religious students on this campus overall. Be proud of your faith. Talk about it, write about it, bring it up in class, because that might be what gets you through the next moment of religious isolation. Leah R.

rice_thresher_2023_18,"ByNoah Berz11/1/23 12:38am Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Tuesday, Oct. 24, 6 p.m.: Dozens of Rice students and community members gather in the Graduate Student Bubble for an anti-war teach-in because the Basker Institute has plans to celebrate former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger, Hillary Clinton and James Baker at an upcoming gala. The flyer for the event calls the former secretaries “architects of war and imperialism”; intrigued, I, too, make my way there. The teach-in is profound in its wide ranging coverage of the United States government’s bloody involvement in projects of colonialism and imperialism around the world, and owing to its recent escalation, presenters connect their ideas to the current conflict between Israel and Palestine. The ethos of the event seems generally positive — giving a voice to the oppressed and questioning powerful institutions — but as I sit watching the speakers, I wonder: Why isn’t there more acknowledgement of the fact that on Saturday, Oct. 7, we saw the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust? As a Jewish student, this worries me. According to the Anti-Defamation League, there has been an approximately 400% increase in antisemitic incidents across the United States since the attack, many of which have taken place on college campuses. For example, on Oct. 14, an Israeli student at Columbia was assaulted with a stick outside the school’s main library; the next day, Cornell history professor Russel Rickford was quoted calling Hamas’ attack “exhilarating” and “energizing”; and more recently, a video was released depicting a group of pro-Palestinian protestors at Cooper Union banging on one side of locked library doors with frightened Jewish students on the other. I could go on. But for the most part, despite this drastic increase in antisemitic activity at American colleges and universities, when I look around at my fellow students, I don’t see concern. I don’t see outrage. This silence frightens me. The teach-in was no different.Flyersspread on tables in the Grad Bubble, presumably in reference to Hamas, read, “any people subjected to this kind of oppression will eventually use force to defend themselves,” and a quick QR-code scan brought me to asitethat discredited the labeling of Hamas as terrorists. Nowhere inside the tent did I see any printed material commemorating the hundreds of Jews slaughtered and kidnapped on Oct. 7, or the significance that the attack and subsequent events have held for Jewish people. The story they were telling felt one-sided. In addition, a presentation comparing Hindu nationalism to Zionism wrote off concerns around antisemitism as mere “shields” against anti-Zionist criticisms, as if to delegitimize them. It’s true: Anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not the same thing, but when Jewsaroundtheglobeare under attack because of actions carried out by the Israeli government, it is hard to tell the difference. Now more than ever, it is imperative that our community fosters a campus environment in which Jewish students feel safe. Non-Jewish students, that means you. Let your Jewish friends know you’re here for them. Speak out against antisemitism via Instagram. Spread the word. Only by talking about antisemitism can we prevent it from infiltrating our own campus; silence enables complicity. If we as Rice students want to claim, truthfully, to be the voices of the oppressed at this moment in history, it is crucial that we do not overlook the Jewish people. We cannot lose our humanity in the excitement of speaking truth to power. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2023_37,"Last Thursday the Faculty Senateheard a presentationon the Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative and heard a discussion about the potential harm that could come out of it. In her remarks, Provost Persis Drell insisted that EHLI had nothing to do with the IDEAL initiative, but with all respect, I beg to differ slightly from the Provost—I believe that at least the basic spirit of EHLI has everything to do with IDEAL. In my comments, quoted in part inStanford Report, I confessed that I am not entirely against lists of words that are presented informationally to guide against offense and harm. It depends on whether they are simply descriptive and presented as options, or used to mandate language use, whether they apply solely to the particular community that invented the list, or bleed out to infringe upon others’ rights of free speech. These are essential questions that we will be pursuing, but the focus of this essay is more basic. On one level, the EHLI taps into an age-old question: what is the relation between speech and a social contract? Here is the example I gave at Senate: when I was a young man I went through that nervous-making ritual of meeting my prospective in-laws. Before that encounter, I asked my fiancée, “how should I address your mother and father?” I willingly “gave up my rights to free speech” because I wanted to enter their social world and hopefully merge it with mine. I wanted to fit in and I hoped they would want to do the same. I never thought it was an imposition because the ultimate aim was worthy. Here’s where we get to IDEAL. IDEAL has done tremendous work to not just proclaim that Stanford values diversity, but also to walk the walk. Unfortunately, it has every chance of stumbling. Here’s why. If you put all this hard work into recruiting a diverse student body and a diverse faculty, telling them that their diverse backgrounds and worldviews are essential to Stanford’s growth and vitality, and then when they get here you get upset when that diversity actually is diverse, then you are in trouble. “Diverse worlds” includes a way of addressing people and expressing ideas that bind that social world together, awarding people dignity and respect and the same to their ideas and perceptions of the world. If Stanford professors and students get defensive and even punitive when people say, “where I come from, that is offensive and harmful,” then we have the end of IDEAL. It becomes clear that we really don’t want diversity, we want the appearance of diversity to augment our liberal good image of ourselves. We pride ourselves for being “inclusive” when we really are not. We are “inclusive” only on our terms, in our language, according to our norms. A common reaction to being called out on inappropriate language is, “well, I did not know that was a problem.” Hence the usefulness of informational lexicons that precisely help us know these things — if we really want to. And that is the key question. Now you might say, well then “these people” should not have come to Stanford if they don’t want to fit in. But here’s the problem — they likely came to Stanford in large part because of the way Stanford has promoted itself as inclusive of diversity. For example, in hisconvocation speech, our President declared, “Stanford provides you with a crucial opportunity to broaden your worldview, sharpen your perspectives and better understand how people can see common issues very differently.” The challenge now is to make good on such claims. Otherwise all our diversity efforts end up being not unlike any other “civilizing” mission —converting people’s cultures, languages and values into our image. In other words, rather than actually allowing “diversity” to do the work is it supposed to do — adding new knowledge and points of view, we accommodate “diversity” so long as it demands nothing of us — we are not the ones that need to change in any real manner. As I said at the Senate meeting, I personally was grateful to a student who circulated a list of words that had to do with gender and sexual orientation and gender presentation. It defined each and told each term’s proper usage. No one was forced to use it — it was there as an aid. It taught me a whole lot — I didn’t know half the terms, at least not well. But I knew my students cared and I knew that if I misspoke or I misused their language it would not only cause harm, it would cause a kind of distrust that would negatively affect me doing my job — which was to teach. Years and years ago, then-Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education and now president of Occidental College, Harry Elam and I had a conversation about precisely this issue. We came up with a term to describe what we needed to do — invent the “New Effective Classroom.” It would include ways not to just teach, but also to allow diverse students to teach as well. And that meant listening to them in their language, respecting their worldviews, and hopefully taking on some of the knowledge they were sharing with us — the very reason Stanford supposedly invited them here. And when faculty say they feel their “academic freedom” is being eroded when they have to “deal with” these “sensitivities,” I say, “well aren’t you stepping on these individuals’ free speech and academic freedom rights to express their ways of knowing and to hold you accountable for what you say?” And in fact, would it not be helpful to have a non-mandated list of words to help us avoid some of the pitfalls we might face by unconsciously using language that suddenly diverts our class discussion into something else entirely? I must say that I was gratified when the majority of Senators voted to postpone a vote on the motion before us — professors all of a sudden realized that we had no idea what we were actually discussing. There were so many ideas floating about, all fused together, that we decided to take a step back and get clarity. In the interval, I hope not only the Senate, but also Stanford, can continue to think about what really matters and why. I encourage us all to, outside the limelight of super-charged situations like the Senate, and even the classroom, to be open to and with each other. I think of the title of Robyn Maynard and Leanne Betasamosake Simpson’s book,Rehearsals for Living— we need to patiently get back to defining our core values, recognizing the real and difficult challenges, and granting each other the right to make a mistake, for that is something essential to education. We need to be able to rehearse different ways of living and living together."
crimson_2023_105,"“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked.” *** Sylvia Plath is seen as a martyr by many young women. For many, both her life and death are a casualty of a system designed against her — a world where, despite her tremendous potential as a poet and literary luminary, her talent was constrained by sexist attitudes during the time that she was alive. Her story is indicative of women’s potentials not being taken seriously enough, of a sexist society hindering an exceptionally talented woman. In the decades since Plath’s death, herwork and life have been re-examined, her legacy shaped by the subsequent waves of social change that have since taken place. Plath was born in Boston in 1932 and lived close to the city for many years of her life. She attended Smith College, and during her time there, she excelled academically while experiencing mental health turbulence. After graduating summa cum laude, Plath moved to England on a Fulbright scholarship, where she met the poet Ted Hughes, who would later become her husband. In 1962, she wrote many of the poems which would become part of her notable poetry collection “Ariel.” In February of 1963, Plath died by suicide at 30 years old. Plath was bright and ambitious — I can see why many equally bright and ambitious young women relate so deeply to her. When I think about her college years, consisting of both success and disappointment, I feel a deep sense of sadness for what was yet to come for her. I encounter a similar twinge of sadness when I read her work, despite the optimism many of her pieces contain. Plath’s work is expansive, capturing so much of what she, and likely other women during her time, felt. From “The Colossus,” published in 1960, to “The Bell Jar,” published in 1963, she forged a multiverse of yearning, hope, and loss. Throughout the 60s, as second-wave feminism brought women into the streets to protest for reproductive rights and equal rights, her work — especially her unfiltered lens into feminine ambition and talent — was revolutionary. Although we may speculate about Plath’s life, and what exactly she might have been motivated by, she is still a stranger to me. There is something weird about animating historical figures and thinking about them in terms of modern day societal expectations. Even though I may relate to Plath’s journey of ambition, she is still someone I can never truly know. The best I can do is to look at the legacy of what she has left behind and try to make sense of it. When I think about Plath and her work, I often think about potential: the potential she had to forge a long career as a writer, and see herselfwin a Pulitzerwhen she was still alive. Plath’sallegory of the fig tree, detailed in “The Bell Jar,” is a perfect example of this idea of unrealized potential. In the allegory, the protagonist recounts sitting atop a fig tree, each branching fig representing a different path in life, a different thing she wants for herself. The story is relatable but disappointing, because her main character thinks that she must choose only one path instead of feeling empowered to try to pursue all of her interests and passions wholly. Like Plath, many of my peers on campus are talented, ambitious, and extremely smart women, including some of my closest friends. Like the protagonist in “The Bell Jar,” we see so many futures for ourselves. I want all of us to succeed, and be able to walk down all of the branching paths we have envisioned, instead of feeling like we must only ever choose one. When I put myself in the shoes of the woman sitting atop the fig tree, I see so many things I want to accomplish; so many new things I want to try, so many new skills I want to learn. I see a world so big and inviting, wonderful futures that beckon and wink. Women deserve self-determinism in all they want to learn and pursue; they deserve to feel like they have the whole world at their fingertips, the ability to accomplish all of their dreams and hopes. Sylvia Plath would have been 90 years old if she was still alive today. How much more could she have done with all of that time? Here’s to you, Sylvia, and your fig tree.

rice_thresher_2023_19,"ByFelicity Phelan11/1/23 12:37am Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. Last week’s Thresher included a guest opinion objecting to the 2023 Night of Decadence theme, “NODie Dreamhouse: Cum On Barbie, Let’s Get NODy.” I applaud the article’s authors for their commitment to challenging latent and linguistically-embedded sexism in their campus community — everything around us, even something as silly and salacious as a NOD theme, can and should be examined for carried biases and perpetuated marginalizations. But “Cum on Barbie” is not one of those cases. The article claims that “cumming” on Barbie (taken to be a stand-in for women more broadly “diminishes Barbie’s autonomy and reduces her to an object designed solely to satisfy the cisgender heterosexual male’s desire.” I find no basis, however, for the idea that ejaculating onto a person implies a lack of autonomy or enthusiasm on the part of the receiver; ideally, people of any gender would be able to engage in any consensual sex act without it having any bearing on their autonomy or personhood. I don’t dispute that some instances of ejaculation could hold meanings of misogynistic domination and female passivity for viewers or participants. But applying that reading of the act to all possible “Cum on Barbie”’s actually perpetuates a patriarchal view of sex as something that men enjoy, seek out, benefit from and women passively endure but are ultimately degraded by, rather than a mutually-desired experience of intimacy. The article correctly points out that Internet search results for “cum on” overwhelmingly display male hegemony over women and thus indicate a patriarchal bent. To that, I would say that pornographic media is going to be dominated by phallo- and androcentrism because media in general, and our society in general, are dominated by phallo- and androcentrism. I would argue that popular depictions of any sexual allusion, including those used for past NOD themes, would carry the exact same undertones of misogyny and female objectification the articles’ authors unearthed in their search. But that doesn’t mean we as individuals, as Rice students or as NOD attendees can’t reject and rewrite the narratives that are being handed to us. As America Ferrera’s “Barbie” monologue so astutely discussed, you’d be hard-pressed to find a trait or action that has not at some point been weaponized against women or used to enact domination. These past instances of harm should not be reasons to cut women off from aspects of public or intimate life. Just because sex — or, for that matter, Barbie — has been used to stigmatize, degrade and marginalize women doesn’t mean we don’t have a right to take it back. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2023_7,"Asking a college student their opinion on trigger warnings is a quick litmus test for their views on the shifting norms in academia and in classrooms. In my experience, many proponents of trigger warnings believe discomforting texts deserve less attention, and in classes where they must be read, special attention must be paid to the mental health of students. Those in opposition claim that content warnings exemplify the“coddling of the American mind”and the younger generations’ unwillingness to grapple with unsavory ideas. Yet this dichotomy need not exist: If we alter our understanding of trigger warnings, we will find that they are perfectly compatible with an intellectually challenging and contentious academic environment. There aren’t extensive amounts of peer-reviewed studies on the psychological effects of trigger warnings, but there are some. Benjamin W. Bellet, a Harvard graduate student of psychology, has publishedtwo papers on content warningsin the past couple of years. His first study used participants with no history of trauma or PTSD. Roughly half of the participants in the study received a trigger warning before reading a disturbing literary passage, while the control group forged ahead with no such warning. Bellet found that trigger warnings had no significant effect on anxiety levels except for increasing anxiety among participants who had a “strong belief that words could harm them.” A second study used similar methods with participants who had experienced trauma or suffered from PTSD. Again, participants who received trigger warnings were no less anxious than their counterparts without. Immediately after Bellet published his first findings, some commentators were quick tooverstate the results. For some later commentators, Bellet’s second study contained enough evidence to condemn trigger warnings as a pseudoscientific overreach on college campuses. However, the results of the studies themselves should not be surprising. It would be an oddity if trigger warnings reduced anxiety; they are warnings, after all, not an antidote to psychologically distressing texts and images. These attacks on trigger warnings miss their true purpose: to create autonomy for students who have experienced trauma. Trigger warnings give students the option to avoid texts they might find too difficult to critically engage with. For extreme levels of trauma, this shouldn’t be controversial. Students with personal connections to sexual assault and suicide deserve warnings and the option to disengage with texts that discuss or illustrate these topics. As with all useful tools, the use of trigger warnings can become excessive. Just this month, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland came under fire for posting a trigger warning before a ballet performance; the university warned students about the violent death of a puppet. Beyond spoiling the plot of the show, this frivolous misuse of trigger warnings detracts from the important and necessary work they do for students suffering from trauma. Such illegitimate use of content warnings justly opens the floodgates of criticism and risks transforming a tool for traumatized students into a political baton. Many attacks on trigger warnings do not stem from a disregard for students who have PTSD or related disorders; they stem from what are, in my opinion, very real concerns of sensitivity on college campuses. In 2016, Currier House removed a Housing Day video that contained a parody of then-presidential candidate Donald J. Trump. Although the video was initially approved by Currier’s Faculty Deans, several students complained that the inclusion of Donald Trump — even a satirical blonde-wigged version of him — was offensive. The video made no mention of Trump’s political views. A town hall was called, and a new Housing Day video was made. The saga, with its clear overreaction, speaks to the concerning culture of catastrophization at Harvard. It is important that we do not tie up trigger warnings in arguments about what content should be allowed on campus. I am a firm believer in reading difficult texts and analyzing upsetting images, so long as they serve an educational purpose. Last month, I visited Yad Vashem in Israel, one of the world’s largest Holocaust museums. The photos I saw deeply disturbed me; I found it difficult to think of anything else for the next couple of days. Yet the unsettling experience was transformational. The expression “never again” is commonly used to describe the lessons learned from the Holocaust. As decades pass, the phrase naturally loses its emotional salience. The images at Yad Vashem, unlike statistics and idioms, are deeply affecting. To understand certain parts of history, it takes being disturbed. Any inspiring college education must include texts that offend modern norms. Engaging with uncomfortable, perhaps even evil, ideas is the only way to affirm our moral progress. Harvard — for better or for worse — is educating future political and thought leaders of the world. Many graduates of the College will have to make heavy and wide-ranging decisions. The real world is not curated for emotional stability. As such, a drive to engage with difficult material in the classroom should be a cornerstone of pedagogy at Harvard. Sensitivity may be rising in tandem with trigger warnings on college campuses, but it remains important not to conflate the two. Trigger warnings serve to protect the autonomy of students with histories of trauma. It would be a mistake to abandon them because of a few errant examples of overreach. We have to affirm a culture of reading and discussing difficult works, with trigger warnings serving as a tool for this end, rather than an obstacle. Harold H.

stanforddaily_2023_36,"I became disabled several months ago and must now use a wheelchair. On two recent visits to campus I saw something a bit discouraging. To wheel from place to place required crossing some bike lane marked paths, such as next to the Quad, or streets that cyclists were using. In trying to cross these paths, I found literally every single cyclist unwilling to yield to a wheelchair or even slow down. Riders on scooters behaved the same. Many tried to pretend they didn’t see me, looking away as they sped past. I’m guessing most Stanford people were raised better than this. What happened?

crimson_2023_41,"I grew up in Queens, a borough of New York City perhaps best known as the home ofPeter Parker. More than being home to Spider-man, Queens is also one of the most ethnicallydiverse places on earth. Even though New York is hours from Latin America by plane, it has become a cultural center for many dimensions of the Latino community, with thinkers such asJosé MartíandJulia de Burgosmaking their home in the city for years. A simple look at an arrival board at John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens, with itstons of flights from Latin America, makes apparent the incredible Latino presence in the city. In Queens, “Latino” doesn’t have a clear definition. There are poor Latinos and rich Latinos. There are Black, brown, and white Latinos. There are Latinos who just arrived in New York and ones who have always lived there. The Latino community is a big, welcoming tent. That’s why I was shocked when I was called a fake Latino during my first week at Harvard. I was in Annenberg, and I thought it would be a bonding experience to tell another student that I was also Latino. Instead, I was met with a repulsed look and a comment that I could not be a ‘real’ Latino because I didn’t grow up in Honduras. I stuttered that I really am Honduran. I began mentioning my family ties and multiple visits. That, too, was met with snark. It never dawned on me that someone could have a checklist for what a ‘real’ Latino is. How many years do you have to live in Latin America to be considered ‘real’? Is there a minimum number of hours before you earn your status? A maximum number of vacation hours outside of Latino countries before exposure to other cultures makes you less Latino? These are rhetorical questions. I know I’m Latino. I have Indigenous blood that comes from Central America, and I’ve always felt in tune with my Honduran roots. This interaction didn’t make me question my identity; it made me think about the needless divisions that exist in the Latino community and how they hold us back. The sort of identity gatekeeping I heard that day reminds me of the rhetoric I’ve heard some people use to justify why Latinos aren’t ‘real’ Americans. Maybe they haven t lived long enough in the United States, or they have an accent, or their visits to Latin America prove they aren’t invested in U.S. culture. It’s intriguing that people with this kind of prejudice rarely seem to know or care what a ‘real’ Latino is. Why must we make such distinctions amongst ourselves? This identity gatekeeping also does a disservice to the complex and legitimate reasons why people leave Latin America. For many, especially in poorer countries like Honduras, the choice is not about trying to maintain cultural authenticity — it is about escaping violence and persecution, or trying to find upward mobility in another place. This kind of division pits Latinos against each other based on geography rather than recognizing our shared dignity. This especially hurts the many Latino families that span borders. While I have relatives in Honduras, many live in other Latin American countries, in the United States, and in Europe. Unfortunately, Latino divides don’t stop there. Colorism is prevalent in the Latino community, and Black and Indigenous Latinos too often face the brunt of discrimination in the U.S. and Latin America. For instance, in Brazil, former president Jair Bolsonarodecimated a government agencydesigned to protect Indigenous rights, and his administration stopped recognizing traditional Indigenous lands. In pop culture, Black Latinos are too infrequently cast intop telenovelas, while Latinos who appear to have European features are often elevated as thebeauty standard. We are living at a time when human rights are in jeopardy for Latinos across the world. For example,hate crimesagainst Latinos in the United States have risen since the pandemic, and at universities in the United States, Latinos aredrastically underrepresentedamong faculty. When our community needlessly divides itself, it undermines our collective power to tackle these challenges. Globally, Latin Americans number in the hundreds of millions. In the U.S., we are also the largest andone of the fastest growingminority groups. We have the ability to fight for our rights and win, but that requires unity. There are bound to be differences within a community of more than 600 million people — and, yes, between Latinos who grew up inside and outside of Latin America. Growing up in New York City undoubtedly gave me privileges and opportunities I would not have had growing up in Honduras. My cultural influences, too, would have been different outside of the United States. We can acknowledge these differences without looking down on others and dismissing them as not ‘real.’ We can also find ways to unite and come together despite these differences. Instead of creating arbitrary rules for what constitutes a ‘real,’ as opposed to a ‘fake,’ Latino, we should find ways to come together, both at Harvard and across the world. Our numbers are our strength, and can help us uplift one another. We can’t expect non-Latinos to afford us the respect we deserve if we spend our energy alienating each other. Roberto C.

crimson_2023_152,"“You will have the privilege of teaching some of the most promising students from the best schools in America,” I used to say at the new faculty orientation when I was dean of the College. “And also some of the most promising students from the worst schools in America.” The outcome of Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard leaves a great challenge: How to provide a quality education to students whose preparations differ greatly in quality. Compared with the last time Harvard admissions was before the Supreme Court, the best American high schools are better than ever and the worst have gotten worse — and Harvard is recruiting students from across the whole spectrum. Harvard admissions will adjust to the end of racial affirmative action. It probably has already. The time when you could tell very much about students from their ethnicity has passed, so checkbox diversity has become a poor proxy for educational value added. Indeed, to continue justifying the practice on the basis of the educational merits of a racially diverse student body — which was the basis of the Supreme Court’s 2003 decision upholding race-based preferences — is to put an unconscionable burden on minority students. It tells them, in effect, that they are expected to conform to stereotypes, to represent their group’s perspective on whatever subject is under discussion. But race still plays a role in our lives here at Harvard, because we do not all live the same lives in America. A few years ago, a Black faculty colleague of mine was stopped by Boston police while running to catch a train — stopped simply for “running while Black.” No such thing has happened to me in eight decades of city living. In the classroom, this colleague was no different from me in any important way (except being smarter . But education is more than just academic instruction, and to some students, his presence was in important ways more meaningful than mine. Harvard can and should be a place where race does not matter, but our country has a ways to go. So how do we resolve this paradox? How do we maintain a community in which we can learn from others’ diverse experiences, without forcing any individual to be a model for an identity group? I believe that admissions officers will do their job — judging applicants on the basis of what they have done with the opportunities that were available to them, rather than the absolute level they have reached. I am less confident that we, the faculty, understand the challenge set out to us by having that diversity of backgrounds scattered through our classes. That is where the real work needs to be done. Some curricular adjustments are relatively easy, like gateway courses, on-ramps where students from more modest high schools can catch up quickly to the level of their more advantaged peers. These should be priorities, but are often afterthoughts. Too few professors take joy in teaching math, or poetry, to eager but poorly schooled novices — because the system for hiring, promoting, and rewarding faculty does not motivate it. But some problems are more subtle. Consider the plight of the humanities. Relative enrollment in humanities majors has shrunk as the student body has become more diverse. Socioeconomically disadvantaged students are less likely to enroll in the humanities, perhaps reflecting expectations of what it means to be upwardly mobile. But it’s not that they dislike the humanities — they know less about the field, having in many cases attended under-resourced high schools with only the most utilitarian English curricula. A Computer Science colleague from another institution recently told me that he had taught a course jointly with an English professor, and the course was dual-numbered between the two departments. At the first meeting the professors asked students to say a few words about what they wanted to get out of the course. One student said that she wanted to read literature — she picked this course because if she signed up for it under the Computer Science number, she could do so without having to answer questions back home about why she was wasting her time studying English. Then two other students acknowledged thinking the same thing. These students feel a different kind of pressure to conform to type. Disadvantaged students have had a different American experience, one that profoundly affects their lives at Harvard. When I encourage students to take time off, either to scratch an entrepreneurial itch or to get their heads together when their motivation and performance flag, they are far more likely to take my advice seriously if they come from middle- or upper-class family backgrounds. No rich student ever told me, “But grandma would kill me if I dropped out of Harvard!” The process of diversifying the student body will continue, perhaps changed as a result of the Supreme Court decision. A great challenge remains: What can Harvard do to free its educationally and socioeconomically disadvantaged students to have the life-changing experiences here that more advantaged students can choose without hesitation or guilt?

stanforddaily_2023_61,"Yesterday, The Daily did something unfathomable. As a publication by and for Stanford students, The Daily has great responsibility when reporting on students — especially when, like now, tensions on campus are running high. So it is especially concerning that yesterday The Daily published an article with unverified information accusing a Jewish student of assaulting one Palestinian, one “visibly Arab” and one hijab-wearing student on Oct. 15. The supposed assault occurred in White Plaza as the three students were taking down signs with pictures, names and ages of some of the over 200 Israeli civilians who were kidnapped by Hamas, an internationally recognized terrorist organization. The article and its title make it sound like ripping off posters with pictures of Hamas hostages is business as usual, implying that it is an honorable thing to do. In a statement to The Daily, the accused student testified that, “I simply asked them to stop destroying the posters. There was no altercation and I absolutely did NOT touch anyone. I have a witness who can verify that. This is a totally false and groundless accusation.” The article refers to a video that “depicts the suspect yelling ‘Shut the fuck up’ to an alleged victim before the students walked away from each other.”But, The Daily does not allege that the video has proof of physical violence. There is no evidence of physical assault. Though The Daily article made sure to note everything as ‘alleged,’ their quote from a Department of Public Safety spokesperson was definitive, making it seem like the assaultdidhappen. Yesterday’s outrageous Daily article was not an aberration. Last Wednesday, The Daily published an alternative account of the antisemitic behavior of Ameer Hassan Loggins, a lecturer in Stanford’s mandatory course for frosh. Asreportedin a New York Timesopinion, “A lecturer in one class that day asked Jewish students to raise their hands, then took one of the Jewish student’s belongings and told him to stand apart from everyone else, saying that was what the Israelis did to the Palestinians.” Another student reported: “he turned to an Israeli student and asked how many Jews died in the Holocaust. When that student said six million, the teacher replied, many more millions died in colonization, which is what he said Israel was doing to the Palestinians. He then asked all of the students to say where they were from and depending on the answer, he told them whether they were colonized or colonizer. When a student said, ‘Israeli,’ he called the student a colonizer.” In sharp contrast to the Times’article on the issue,the account published in The Daily appears to be written solely to defend Loggins’s actions. The Daily article goes to great lengths to paint Loggins’s actions as over exaggerated, implicitly accusing Jewish students of dishonesty. Two Stanford Israel Association board members spoke with the students who were targeted by Loggins and communicated the pain and discomfort that Loggins caused them. Rather than taking these expressions of the Jewish students’ experiences seriously, the article immediately proceeds to cite non-Jewish students, inappropriately calling into question the Jewish students’ experiences. For example, The Dailyquotes a student who said, “as a class we all really loved having him as a professor.” Similarly, a student is quoted saying, “It was to be funny, Loggins was laughing.” The Jewish students who reported Loggins to the University clearly didn’t agree. Per journalistic best practices, reporters should obtain as much relevant information as possible. The Daily does feature the testimony of students in the class, but they are neither Jewish nor Israeli. Since when is it acceptable for bystanders to tell victims how they’re supposed to feel? Such journalistic incompetence is unacceptable. Ironically, at the same time The Daily minimized Jewish accounts of antisemitism, it also published “Hundreds call for University action in protest for Palestine,” which failed to mention what is easily interpreted as a direct call during the rally to take up arms against fellow Stanford students: “On college campuses, including this one, … People’s resistance is met through doxing, harassment and intimidation campaigns which endanger Palestinian life. What is there left to do but to take up arms?” Journalists have power. Since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack which killed 1,400 Israeli civilians and took over 200 hostages, Jewish and Israeli students have been targeted on the basis of their identities. They continue to encounter slogans calling for the destruction of their country and the concomitant genocide of their people chalked on the ground. Jewish and Israeli students have had to sit and listen as neighbors, classmates and friends justify the brutal slaughter of their friends and family. The Daily contributes to this campus climate, and must acknowledge that irresponsible and one-sided reporting impacts Jewish students. We condemn what is in our view The Daily’s repeated indifference to assaults on Jews and its promotion of libelous and antisemitic accounts. Signed, The Stanford Israel Association This article was written by Andrei Mandelshtam, co-president, and other members of the Stanford Israel Association."
crimson_2023_16,"In a sea of umbrellas and gilded robes, I couldn’t help but observe the palpable disappointment etched across the faces of some of those gathered at University President Claudine Gay’s inauguration. Despite the rumors, it had quickly become clear that former President of the United States Barack Obama would in fact not be making an appearance. Making not-so-discrete exits in the thick of Gay’s official address, students realized they had let their hopes run rampant and let substanceless buzz eclipse the gravity of this historic event. It’s no secret that Harvard is a hub for big names. In its four centuries of existence, our University has seen everybody from the Dalai Lama to Sacha Baron Cohen walk through its gates. And, for better or for worse, we students can’t get enough of it. Driven by little more than whispers and rumors, we swarm to ill-defined corners of campus at the drop of a hat, hoping to flag downNatalie Portman ’03for a signature. We push through vicious crowds to snap a picture with royals likePrincess Catherine of Wales. We kick ourselves for missing out onKim Kardashian’s lectureat Harvard Business School. Prestige is built into our University’s DNA. Harvard’s reputation as a breeding ground for academics, industry leaders, high achievers, and entertainers has made it a focal point for individuals eager to share their journeys and expertise with the student body. The Institute of Politics’s John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum is a shining example that hosts speakers of the likes of Malala Yousafzai and Ban Ki-moon. However, this constant influx of high-profile appearances has reached a saturation point. The opportunity to hear from a former head of state is practically a daily occurrence and has become, in a sense, skippable. Being offered such remarkable opportunities on a near daily basis completely loses its significance when we reroute speaker event emails straight to our spam folder. These days, it takes something completely momentous (or, at least, the promise of free boba to draw out the Harvard crowd. Our campus’s coveting of stardom and the allure of big names highlights a deeper issue: an excessive reverence for prestige, regardless of substance. So much of what Harvard is lies in its reputation; yet beneath this veneer of celebrity, the University grapples with ongoing challenges. We students are still fightingfor denaming,hot breakfast, andmental health outreach, to no foreseeable end. It’s doubtful that any amount of headline-making VIPs would quell any of these substantive concerns. Perhaps too perfectly, the John Harvard statue embodies our complex relationship with fame and image. Even as it stands as a testament to our institution’s legendary history, its popular historical origin is based in myth, or ratherthree apparent lies. Nonetheless, he remains the pinnacle of the Harvard experience for 8 million tourists yearly as of 2017, his false likeness incessantly photographed, rubbed, and posted on Facebook. As students, we’re implicitly socialized to pick and choose who’s worth our time on the basis of name recognition, how popular they are in Washington, D.C., or any other degree of exclusivity that makes up their identity. This form of social prominence often remains unspoken yet firmly ingrained in our collective consciousness. However, we might find ourselves wholly dissatisfied with the quality of our connections if we continue to read people like resumes. While big names are great, they aren’t everything. They certainly aren’t the sole measure of value in one’s pursuits. The search for meaningful work is a journey that continually evolves with time. It’s essential to recognize that not every endeavor should be driven by the pursuit of recognition or external validation. If we live under the expectation that we must work, we should at least engage in the pursuit of meaningful work. True worth lies beyond the confines of labels and accolades. It can be discovered in the unaccredited activities — those late-night debates shared among friends and strangers, strolls through our architecturally rich surroundings, and the simple pleasure of reading for the sheer joy of it. In the end, it is these experiences that often prove to be the most rewarding and fulfilling aspects of our time in college. More important to me than big names, are these small moments. Julia S.

stanforddaily_2023_98,"Last Thursday, the Faculty Senate passed a resolution whichbegins: “The Faculty Senate finds that the current mechanisms are insufficient to ensure the academic integrity of our degree programs and, in line with the Articles of Organization of the Academic Council, re-assumes final responsibility for the maintenance of academic integrity.” That to me is a curious statement, because as someone who served as Chair of the Faculty Senate, I could not recall any mention of such a responsibility. Although The Stanford Dailynotes: “The Faculty Senate’s latest motion, introducing proctoring, was passed by their action alone and justified ‘on the authority of the Faculty Senate,’” despite numerous readings of the governance documents of the Faculty Senate, I find no reference to any such authority. The only reference to any such authority in fact does not and cannot pertain to the Faculty Senate. In The Daily’s reportage of the Senate meeting we find this passage: “In 1955, the ASSU Honor Code Committee acknowledged the Honor Code as a privilege that students received from the faculty. ‘The faculty hold the prerogative to revoke the code at any time, if they feel it is not being handled properly,’ Prof. Richard Taylor said.” Yet here as well there is no specific document spelling out the Faculty Senate’s authority — which makes sense, since the Faculty Senate did not exist in 1955. Indeed this resolution does more than wind the clock back to 1955 — in so doing it erases the founding spirit of the Faculty Senate, shreds the current Honor Code, and violates a spirit of enfranchisement and participation enshrined in the Honor Code. Moreover, it does so by evoking extremely problematic characterizations of students. A lot happened between 1955 and 1968,when the Faculty Senate was established. It was founded in response to increased student (and some faculty activism around civil rights and the Vietnam War. Stanford elected to have a robust and rational process through which University policies could be discussed and debated as democratically as possible. The fact that every Senate meeting contains a moment when any senator can ask a question of the President and the Provost is a sign of the founding spirit of the Stanford Faculty Senate — that everyone should be held accountable. So much of what had happened in US history since 1955 had been about enfranchisement of minorities of all sorts, and a recognition that if democracy is to have any meaning, it must have as wide a participation of peoples as possible. Hence the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Sadly, our country has yet to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, approved by the US Senate in 1972 but as yet unratified by the states. I mention this historical context to show that the climate of the time was filled with the recognition of the importance of enfranchisement, and of democracy, and the people who established the Faculty Senate had these things on their minds. This basic spirit continues today — thecurrent Honor Coderemains a strong index to the same, essential collaborative spirit: “While the faculty alone has the right and obligation to set academic requirements, the students and faculty will work together to establish optimal conditions for honorable academic work.” What triggered the resolution to destroy that principle was the perception that students cheat with such frequency that they have breached the contract. Yet it was never debated whether or not proctoring will actually help reduce cheating, or, more importantly, whether the as-yet unsubstantiated gain warrants ripping up proud traditions and standing policies. In essence this resolution violated an important covenant regarding the Honor Code and in effect blackmailed the Undergraduate Senate (UGS into either accepting the C-12 proposal it had unanimouslyvoted downor accepting the Faculty Senate resolution. In either case it places the undergraduate student body within an entirely anti-democratic process. Those favoring the resolution spoke in ways that were to me deeply troubling, and of another age. For example, it was remarkable to me how ready many senators were to lump all undergraduates into one criminal class. When UGS representatives mentioned trust, not a few senators and others rolled their eyes in mockery. Sponsors of the resolution said it was “students” who had breached trust by cheating in the first place and accused “students” of acting “entitled.” When this happened, I could not help but think — yes, that is exactly why some people did not (and still do not want voting rights for Blacks and other minorities — after all, they were untrustworthy, tended toward criminality, and were demanding more and more social entitlements. Shockingly, and again reminiscent of the civil rights era and the period of decolonization, students were thought to be not ready for democracy precisely when they exercised their rights and took positions that were not the ones those in power wanted. This was made most apparent when senators made the argument that the UGS “would never change its mind” about proctoring, as if it were incumbent upon them to do so. It is exceedingly strange that Stanford puts in place a Civic, Liberal, and Global Education (COLLEGE curriculum extolling the virtues of citizenship and democracy, and then the Faculty Senate brazenly acts to disenfranchise the undergraduate members of its community and squelch a legitimate democratic vote. Stanford undergraduates had followed the rules — they made their voices heard through their duly-elected representatives. They placed their faith in a process put in place by their university wherein a negative vote by the UGS or any of the other participating bodies would have mooted the re-instatement of proctoring. The Faculty Senate, departing from the spirit of its own founding documents, and in reversing a key principle of Stanford’s Honor Code, dragged us back to the good old days of 1955, when people were all in their proper places, to override the UGS vote. Let’s be clear: those favoring proctoring were losing, so, rebuffed by the democratic process, they simply changed the rules of the game and reinstated authoritarianism. They rationalized this take-over by deploying a now familiar tactic — delegitimizing a fair and honest election. Ironically, the Faculty Senate, in passing a resolution to restore authority it never had, may have also acted improperly in unilaterally changing the principles of the Honor Code (“While the faculty alone has the right and obligation to set academic requirements, the students and faculty will work together to establish optimal conditions for honorable academic work” . Perhaps on all COLLEGE syllabi there should be a disclaimer: “Some of the ideals and values mentioned here may not apply to you. If you wish to find out, ask your professor.” Simply put: in the increasingly Orwellian world of Stanford University, those who voted for this resolution broke a rule and broke a contract in order to punish an entire category of people for the acts of the few who break rules and contracts. This is called “collective punishment” and it is illegal and unethical. I brought this up in Senate — no one cared. Those who voted to strip the entire undergraduate population of their rights were able to do so because it is they who feel entitled to hold to no other code of behavior than the one they themselves invent."
crimson_2023_144,"As a frequent commencement speaker, in preparing a message to graduates, I often begin by asking myself how these students might be imagining the opportunities that lie ahead for them. Surveying the present challenges that lie behind and in front of them, I usually urge them to focus on more than a career ladder common to the profession they wish to pursue — rather, to focus on allocating some of their intellectual capital and energy to areas of improvement in the lives of those who may not have similarly enjoyed the advantages of an excellent education. In a nation where the gaps in economic and social standing among and between groups remain stark, I remind graduates that they alone cannot ensure the health and future prosperity of their communities and the nation. They must, I emphasize, work alongside or lead others in that endeavor. Recently, I have been struck by how numerous tragic events and social struggles have caused many college students to be less confident in the advantages they will enjoy as a result of their years of study. The numerous crises they have endured in such a short span of time have made the emphasis on their good fortunes ring hollow. Indeed, my own apprehension about the state of the world requires that I contemplate how to be meaningfully hopeful in my task as a commencement speaker, so that I do not advance hollow claims about the future graduates will likely face. At the same time, I am disappointed with my more cautious approach, when this is precisely the moment when hopefulness can be most essential as students commence their post-graduate efforts. Yes, these are times that give me pause, in spite of my long and varied experience. Having grown up in a time of violence and strife, I have often observed that steady improvement in the nation has been the result of the beneficial and enlightened efforts of courageous individuals who spurred others to action. It was often their vision of a better future that caused others to join in overturning unfair practices and embracing the importance of shared efforts. The bookends to my undergraduate years were, at the beginning, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy ’40 and, at the end, the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy ’48. Throughout my college years, persistent racial violence in the form of bombings and mob actions plagued our reality as Black college students. Sitting on the lawn of Dillard University on a sunny graduation day and contemplating my lack of civil rights, I could not have been sanguine about the future. Indeed, persistent doubt that the country could move forward in a productive way was a deep concern among all of those graduating with me. Yet, I was compelled to continue my education, seeing that pursuit as an antidote to seemingly omnipresent irrational actions. Inspired by civil rights leaders, I chose to keep my efforts focused stubbornly on a future that could be better if enough people worked together to effect change and demonstrate concern for others across our differences. Remembering those years helps me put the current troubling events in perspective — these may not actually be the worst of times. To be sure, a pandemic, continuing political upheaval, the threat to civil rights long thought secure, poisonous public discourse, anti-intellectual policy-making, and significant economic challenges might naturally cause us to have a pessimistic outlook. Yet, over the course of time, our lives are frequently upended by uncontrolled and unforeseen events that shake our confidence in the future. In that event, we can either falter or become even more determined to engage in action that centers on the common good. I have always chosen the latter and, in many ways, that stubborn determination to seek the good has provided me purpose and uplift for a life that I would not have traded for another. And so, in my commencement speeches this year, I will, even in these difficult times, invoke the need for graduates to look beyond their personal ambition, to ways of incorporating in their lives actions that contribute to advancing our common well-being. Whatever the future holds for them, the challenges will be made lighter and their satisfaction greater if they are connected in an intentional way to advancing the equality and well-being of others.

Simmons is a graduate of Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the incoming senior adviser to the president of Harvard on engagement with historically Black colleges and universities, this year’s Convocation speaker for Harvard Graduate School of Education, and this year’s Commencement speaker for Prairie View A&M University."
ubyssey_2023_44,"Jan. 31, 2023 Written byThea Baines This article contains mention of sexual assault and gender-based violence. When I started studying at UBC in September 2019, I was disgusted by the systemic rape culture present on campus. During Jump Start, instead of learning about consent, safe sex or harm reduction, fraternity parties that reinforce rape culture and misogyny were pushed (or, more fittingly, plugged by AMS and UBC party organizations onto barely-legal teens. “You should go, it’ll be fun,” I recall an older student suggesting to me. “Just know you might get groped.” This message projects an idea that the bodies of women and non-binary students are inevitably going to be objectified, commodified and subjected to violence. My experiences of rape culture at UBC are not uncommon. This violence has been normalized by UBC for decades. It seems that nearly every year, recurring instances of sexual assault and harassment emerge from our university — especially in the athletic and fraternity communities (which often overlap — shown by the2021 sexual assault chargesagainst Tremont Levy, Trivel Pinto and Ben Cummings, three former UBC football players. These chargeswere stayedas of January 25. Moreover, I was disgusted to learn about the ignorance and idleness of my own department, the history department, in their mishandling of PhD student Dmitry Mordvinov’s allegedstring of assaultsin the early 2010s. However, instances of rape culture and campus gender-based violence aren’t always private: such as the disturbingSauder ‘rape chants’ of 2013, to theplacement of a male signatop the Engineering Cairnthe day before the Ecole Polytechnique Massacre Memorial in 2016. These public displays of misogyny normalize and validate violence against women and non-binary people, viscerally reminding all of campus who is welcome and who is not. Everyone deserves to feel safe and sovereign in their bodies, regardless of how they dress or where they go. Normalizing sexualized violence and seeing nonconsensual sexual advances as inevitable and ordinary exacerbates rape culture at UBC. The anger I experienced as a first year witnessing this immense disregard for bodily autonomy and self-determination was reinforced when we were isolated by the COVID-19 pandemic in my second semester. As domestic and sexual violence rates climbedacross the countryandthe world, I resolved to find a community on campus where I could put this anger into action on campus. That is how I found the peer program at UBC sSexual Violence Prevention and Response Office (SVPRO , a campus resource centre dedicated to combating sexual violence and supporting survivors. Here, I was able to educate myself on the intersections of sexual violence, rape culture and other systems of oppression in our society like racism, sexism and capitalism. By reading the incredible works of feminist, critical race and Queer theorists, such as bell hooks, Angela Davis and Audre Lorde, I have come to understand the personal as political. While narratives at neoliberal institutions like UBC encourage us to see sexual violence as an individual issue — one that can be solved through lifestyle changes like carrying pepper spray,drink-checking nail polishand whistles — feminism teaches us to contextualize social issues by understanding them as part of larger social system. The history of recorded North American anti-violence work started with thefights of the feminist activists in the 1970s and 1980sagainst systemic misogyny and normalized rape culture. Against a backdrop of increasing cutbacks to social services as well as a rising anti-feminist rhetoric, activists and workers collaborated to start shelters, transition houses and rape crisis centres across Canada. It is only through this grassroots work that we even have the vocabulary to define and fight back sexual violence. Unlike the solutions of the state, which focus on institutionalization and criminalization, feminists inspired a grassroots plea to find inclusive and holistic strategies. This included building a movement that was not only explicitly feminist, but also anti-racist, anti-colonial and Trans-inclusive. Our culture must change, and since language and everyday interactions perpetuate rape culture, we must all change as well. I believe we have a collective responsibility to destabilize rape culture and dismantle the oppressive notions that sexual violence is expected or inevitable. The only way to stop sexual violence and make people feel safe on campus is to make it unacceptable in our community. Call out harmful jokes and oppressive comments. Support and listen to women and non-binary people in your communities. Educate yourself on consent and encourage your peers to do the same. Don’t support institutions that are notorious for perpetuating rape culture and sexual violence. Better yet, if you are a member of one of these communities (such as so-called ‘Greek Life’ , work to combat the toxic notions of patriarchy, heteronormativity and elitism within your institution that perpetuate sexual violence. Reach out to the abundance of services on campus, like SVPRO or the student-fundedAMS Sexual Assault Support Centre (SASC , for workshops, canvas modules and literature. Finally, and most importantly, overtly and explicitly believe survivors and condemn victim-blaming. By destabilizing rape culture at UBC, we start to work toward a better society. We must address the violence of the state within our conversations about sexual and gender-based violence. This includes dismantling institutionalized violence of local forms of authority which push people — especially people of colour, Trans people and disabled people— into the violence of homelessness, addiction and prison. UBC already has an abundance of resources for sexual violence education, prevention and response. SVPRO and the SASC are already doing crucial work to address harm and build a culture of consent on our campus. But they cannot do it alone — it is a responsibility of everyone in our community to step up and say no to rape culture. We can build a better world where everyone holds the birth right of bodily autonomy. It is not an easy task, but building an accountable, respectful and inclusive community at UBC is a place to start.

rice_thresher_2023_58,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/21/23 10:18pm The Thresher endorses a Student Association presidential candidate every year. This year, to no one’s surprise, the Editorial Board endorses Solomon Ni — not only because he is theonlyoption, but also because he has expansive plans to make changes. However, in a time of exceptionally low engagement both externally and within the SA, many of his plans are overly ambitious without laying a solid foundation. As we read through Ni’s platform, we couldn’t help but chuckle. Some of his proposals — hiring more Wellbeing & Counseling staff and implementing free on-campus winter housing for students — are presented as simple fixes, when in reality they are unlikely to materialize. Others, such as lobbying the City of Houston for bike lanes near campus and renter protections or lobbying the state legislature to allow Rice IDs to be accepted as voter ID, are laughably unachievable. We’re concerned that Ni is too preoccupied with their lofty plans to actualize real changes that will truly benefit student lives during his term. We suggest that Ni choose a few concrete, achievable proposals and work to successfully implement them, rather than stretching himself too thin by setting utopian groundwork that future Student Associations may or may not build upon. To his credit, Ni’s proposals for internal improvements are much more feasible. Ni has been a champion for transparency of the SA’s actions through publicizing the budget in their role as treasurer and has plans to create a bill tracker to increase visibility of the movement of legislation. We also applaud their plans for the implementation of a bereavement policy in professors’ syllabi and revisions of Title IX policies to prioritize survivors. Ni also discussed wanting to increase the number of appointed positions within the SA, and he and the other candidates at the recent Thresher Town Hall assured attendees that they plan to fill appointed positions with qualified students. While we appreciate that sentiment, it is notable that these appointed positions will be appointed by Ni and a slate of candidates who essentially appointed themselves through uncontested elections. Ni is running unopposed for a reason. SA engagement is embarrassingly low, and many students feel that voting, much less serving within the SA, doesn’t make enough of an impact to be worth their time. Before Ni can focus on ambitious policy goals, he needs to build a solid foundation for the SA and address the fact that no one on campus thinks the SA does anything that affects their lives. Every year, candidates come in with these big ideas. They set up groups to talk about them, but then nothing gets done. The president that the SA needs right now is not one who has a four page platform of mostly unachievable goals. The president the SA needs right now is one who gives a few specific and achievable plans they can devote their time to implementing. Those include the aforementioned bereavement policies in syllabi, beginning discussions with departments and student-run businesses on increasing students’ minimum wage and working with Housing & Dining to introduce more late-night food options on campus. Ni isn’t running for president of the United States, city council or anything in between. He should throw out the parts of his platform that are nothing more than political grandstanding and fight for concrete, effective changes that will boost students’ trust and engagement in our Student Association.

stanforddaily_2023_77,"Dear Prof. Berk, Together with Prof. Lipsick, I brought before the Faculty Senate, in its May 11 session,the resolutionthat calls for the dissolution of the ties between our University and Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Mercer. I feel obliged to respond to your criticism of our resolution in the op-ed published inThe Dailyon May 17. Like many other opponents of our resolution, you base your criticism on the idea of academic freedom, which you (and many others erroneously confuse with freedom of speech. As many scholars who work on this subject point out, one of the key differences between academic freedom and freedom of speech is that the former is inseparable from responsibility: responsibility to students, to the field, and to the public in general (for an excellent exploration of these two concepts, see the book by Yale Law School professor Robert Post, “Democracy, Expertise, and Academic Freedom: A First Amendment Jurisprudence for the Modern State,” 2012 . In your op-ed article, you simply ignore this important distinction and collapse academic freedom and freedom of speech. That is a very convenient red herring, and it has been used often these days. However, much more perplexing than this confusion of ideas is your use of the example of Nazi Germany to illustrate your point. I am not aware of any statements Hitler made about academic freedom. Whatever his beliefs might have been on that subject, they were clearly expressed in thepublic burningsof books by Jews, communists, and anyone else who did not adhere to the ideology of the National-Socialist party (speaking of analogies, you might want to pay attention tobook banning in Floridaand some other states: there is but a small step from banning to burning of books . I am afraid that, on that point, you are making an even more erroneous and potentially very damaging confusion. I came of age in the long shadow of the Nazi occupation of Serbia, and this brings to mind a couple of stories that can help clarify the misconstructions that you publicize in your article. The stories I’m going to share with you come from the repertoire of narratives that have helped, over the decades, devastated communities to work through their grief and loss, and to come to terms with the world that allowed for the unthinkable atrocities they suffered to happen. These stories are devastating and hard to tell, but I will try to do my best. Even if they are apocryphal, they provide valuable insights into important distinctions that we need to make in order to secure our ethical survival. In mid-October 1941, in the course of only three days, Nazi forces summarily executed over 2,000 civilians in my hometown ofKraljevoin central Serbia. After the war, the killing fields were turned into a memorial park for the victims. Squeezed between factories, from which the workers were taken out for execution, the memorial consists of hundreds of stylized tree stubs made of white marble. Every October 14, the whole city would gather there to remember and mourn its dead. I remember that, on our way to the memorial park, we would pass by a solitary unmarked tomb placed by the side of the road, away from the mass graves. Growing up, I would ask the adults about that burial place, and they would tell me that it belonged to a soldier who refused to shoot at the mass of civilians. The commanding officer killed him on the spot. In stating his refusal to open fire, the Wehrmacht soldier made a decision that amounted to him stepping out of the firing squad and effectively positioning himself in front of it. In doing this, he rejected the (un ethical community that coalesced in Germany under the Nazi rule, which allowed for unpunished execution of individuals who didn’t conform with certain racial ideals: the Jews, the mentally disabled, the Roma, the homosexuals, etc. In occupied lands, the Slavs were added, abundantly, to that list. As the American law scholarLon L. Fullerpowerfully argued in his debate with H. L. A. Hart on the subject of the persecution of crimes committed during the Nazi era, social laws and regulations are erected on the foundations consisting of the values shared by the ethical communities that they, in turn, come to regulate. That applies to the laws in any organized state including the Nazi Germany, as well as to regulations guiding other social institutions, such as the Code of Conduct at our University. You see, Prof. Berk, in our resolution, we are not questioning anyone’s academic freedom (especially that of non-academics such as Hitler, Murdoch, and Mercer . Instead, we are calling attention to the values we need to uphold in order to maintain a functioning ethical community at our institution. The second story is even more difficult for me to go back to and narrate here. But, I will go on. We are back in that bloody October. Only one week after the carnage in my hometown, the Nazi occupying forces continued their killing frenzy in the neighboring town ofKragujevac. Justifying the mass executions as a revenge for the acts of armed resistance and a prevention of future similar actions, they again rounded and killed some 3,000 innocent people. Only, with the horrific difference that this time around, among the victims was a fifth-grade class from the local school for boys. As the story goes, they took them and their teacher out from their classroom and to the execution grounds. (There was a rumor going around kids in my elementary school that our old literature teacher was one of the survivors: he was said to be too tiny to be slain with other boys. According to one version of the story, local Quislings who assisted the Nazi occupying forces in preparations for this atrocity offered to let the teacher go, as there was a shortage of instructors in schools, but he refused. After the Nazis forced him and his pupils to line up in front of a trench that would serve as their common grave, he was reported to have said: “Go ahead, fire — even now I am teaching my class.” In standing up to his executioners, the teacher was exercising his freedom of speech; in standing by his students, he was living up to his academic freedom. I will try to clarify this further. When he spoke his mind, the teacher was asserting his freedom of speech. It was not offered to him on a silver plate: he claimed it, because he was an essentially free man, and he paid for it dearly. When he held fast to his responsibility to his students, he was embracing his academic freedom. I hope this will help you, Prof. Berk, to understand the difference between freedom of speech and academic freedom: the first one is the right that some people are entitled to and some have to fight for; the second is a calling that one responds to, and is thus held responsible for. We constitute an ethical community by recognizing ourselves in, and answering to, certain values. That includes clearly stating which ideas are threatening the ethical sustainability of the community in which we live and work. There are stories, few and far between, that come to us as drops of wisdom distilled from immeasurable human suffering. The two stories that I shared with you, Prof. Berk, and with the readers of The Daily belong to that corpus of narratives. They hold the kind of knowledge that cannot be simulated. If institutions of higher learning aspire to serve as custodians to anything, they should be custodians to this kind of knowledge. (And here is the paradox: we need these stories more than they need us! I approach these stories with a great deal of awe and respect. My decision to share them in this way was not easy. I did that because I believe that we live at an important juncture in our culture in academia and outside of it. In the general confusion that surrounds us, we often tend to forget that what the University has to offer to young people is not only a path to a life of material prosperity, but access to precious knowledge contained in these stories, which can provide them with a moral compass. This knowledge is priceless. There is no money that Mercer or Murdoch or any other rich donor possesses that could purchase that knowledge. This higher learning is earned, not bought. If we expect students and faculty to live up to its standards, so should everyone else. Yours truly, Branislav Jakovljević"

crimson_2023_113,"Whenever I am having a good day — whether I did well on a midterm or caught up with a friend who I hadn’t seen in a while — a quick glance at the major national news headlines almost unfailingly dampens my mood. Although every day brings tidings of countless distressing matters occurring worldwide, my own country — the United States — occupies the largest fraction of my daily thoughts. In particular, I’ve found myself appalled at a recent slew of new laws restricting Americans’ fundamental rights and threatening the lives of vulnerable groups across the country. Apart from undermining the values that our nation was purportedly founded upon, these laws demonstrate a complete rejection of basic standards of humanity. They — and, more importantly, the leaders and political culture that have created them — speak volumes about the nation we live in. They clearly exemplify why I do not proudly wave the American flag. Only days after a mass shooter killedseveral elementary schoolers and faculty membersat The Covenant School in Nashville, lawmakers in Florida responded by intensifying our national love affair with guns. Governor Ron DeSantissigned a bill passed by the state legislatureeliminating current laws that require a state license to carry concealed, loaded firearms. As children continue to die within the walls of the very buildings where they should feel the safest, policymakers actively create the conditions for bullets to deprive them of life — supposedly a guarantee of the Constitution — before they even learn algebra. Lawmakers’ outright refusal to protect vulnerable groups is also apparent in the unprecedented wave of legislation putting the lives of trans Americans at risk. One survey found that over 50 percent of trans and non-binary young people throughout the United Statesconsidered committing suicide just last year. Just a few months later, the Kentucky legislature voted tooverride the governor’s vetoof a bill that would prohibit doctors from providing gender-affirming care to trans youth and prevent school districts from even recommending that students be addressed using their preferred pronouns. Kentucky isn’t alone — at least 10 other states have passed similar bills, including Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, and Utah. With every vote to prevent a transgender child from accessing the medical care that they should be entitled to, our elected officials make a mockery of “liberty and justice for all.” The pure callousness with which many U.S. legislators operate is further exemplified in fierce attacks on abortion rights in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Idaho state senators have not only severely restricted abortion access for women within the state — who are 35 percent more likely than men to live below the poverty line nationally — but have also made it a criminal offense to assist a minor in crossing state lines to obtain an abortion. Elected officials’ promises to “promote the general welfare” have become hollow pledges uttered simply to gain entrance to legislative chambers and pursue precisely the opposite mission once inside. Time and time again, presidential hopefuls have stood at podiums throughout the nation asking for our vote to lead the “greatest country in the world.” Yet the U.S. consistently ranks first among high-income countries in matters that only produce embarrassment: maternal mortality rates, gun violence, suicide rates, income inequality, just to name a few. So when I list all of the identities that I take pride in, being a citizen of the United States unfortunately does not make the cut. I cannot be proud of a nation that has eroded my optimism so thoroughly that I have to mentally prepare myself for the fear and disillusionment that comes with reading the news every day. In a republic, our elected officials are meant to represent the values we hold as a nation. Their consistent failure to keep the people they are tasked with protecting alive, not by virtue of simple misfortune but by a sheer lack of compassion and humanity, stamps out any desire I could possibly have to proudly wave the American flag. When my parents immigrated to the U.S. to provide their children with greater opportunities for health and prosperity, they did not envision a nation in which only pure chance prevents their kids from becoming part of an ever-increasing statistic of children who die while obtaining the very education that should ensure their success. I am nevertheless grateful for my parents’ decision — I am not ignorant of the advantages that growing up in this country has afforded me, such as the immense privilege of being a student at the wealthiest university in the world. However, this does not justify the uncritical American exceptionalism that characterizes our national politics. The U.S. is the only country I have ever known as my home, but it is far from earning my admiration. This piece should not be construed as a surrender to pessimism. While I rebuke the decisions of political leaders across the country, I simultaneously witness uplifting efforts on this campus that sustain my hope that I will one day live in a country that I can be proud of. From launchingcampaigns to dename spacesthat uphold the legacy of enslavers torunning homeless sheltersand seeking tohold professors accountablefor sexual misconduct, the students around me give me faith that our generation of leaders and visionaries can redirect our nation toward embodying the ideals that its founders proclaimed nearly 250 years ago. Today, my answer to the question “Are you proud to be American?” is “no” without hesitation. But I hope that one day, I can at least pause and reconsider before responding — even if a resounding “yes” escapes my lifetime. Ericka S.

stanforddaily_2023_20,"In Stanford dining halls, it’s common to see meat alternatives served alongside the “Farm Burger” at lunchtime. Increasing awareness of the negative environmental and health implications of meat consumption has led to the popularization of ultra-processed plant-based products like Impossible and Beyond Meat. While these are great options to have available, they may not be the most effective or healthy alternative. Rather than jumping ships from real to fake meat, we should let meat be meat and consume it sparingly. Let’s shift the emphasis from eating fake meat to reducing meat consumption and increasing unprocessed, whole-food protein sources that are better for our health and the environment. With the global population projected to reach9.8 billion by 2050, it is no secret that this rapid growth is putting serious strains on the environment and the global food supply. How will the Earth support another 2 billion people — 25% of our current population — when our current food system is already pushing the upper limits? Not all sectors within our food system are created equal. Livestock farming, including grazing and the large-scale production of animal feed like corn and soy, is a chief climate offender:14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissionsand29% of global freshwater usecan be attributed to animal husbandry. Animal products provide only18% of the world’s calories, but use 83% of global farmlandand have disproportionately largefootprintsfor erosion,antibiotic use, pesticides and water pollution. In addition to environmental impacts, animal products also pose health risks. Red and processed meat are associated withincreased riskof type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and all-cause mortality. Chicken is innocent in all of this, right? Chicken, a go-to “healthy” protein, is widely available across Stanford dining halls, but how healthy can it be when the animals themselves are so unhealthy? Chickens naturally live betweenfive and 10 years. As discussed in Jonathan Safran Foer’s “Eating Animals,”today’s broiler chickens (chickens raised for meat are slaughtered at six weeks old, largely because their Frankensteinish breeding and the appalling conditions of their upbringing (yes, including “free-range” render them too sickly to survive much longer. They are pumped full of antibiotics that make them grow twice as large in half the time — their bodies grow faster than their bones can support, leading to a deluge of health problems — and contribute to the rise ofantibiotic-resistantstrains of bacterial infections. These methods arestandard practicefor pigs, cows and other factory farmed animals. Long story short, the vast majority of animal products are of major environmental, health and ethical concern. We should shift our diets away from meat and towards unprocessed plant-based alternatives. Prior to learning about the horrors of factory farming, which producesnearly 99% of U.S. meat, I ate meat at least twice a day. Since then, I’ve started transitioning away from meat. At breakfast I swap my once-beloved chicken apple sausage for Greek yogurt and nuts. I steer clear of the overplump drumsticks and chicken breasts that were previously a staple in my dining hall lunch regimen, opting for quinoa or garbanzo jambalaya. That is not to say I avoid meat altogether. Rather than cutting it out completely, I’ve focused on reducing my intake to no more than once per day and prioritizing fish and plant-based alternatives — a diet known as “flexitarianism.” Part of the challenge of eating less meat is finding suitable alternatives. A few days after pointing my parents towards resources like “Eating Animals,”my mother called me to share her agreement that it was time to cut back on meat, and to tell me she had gone to the store and purchased an abundance of Impossible Meat and Beyond Burger. I worried I had set my parents on a dangerous trajectory; I hadn’t intended for them to switch over to a completely ultra-processed meat alternative–based diet. But this is the message many meat-eaters receive when they are told to eat less meat: stop eating meat and switch to ultra-processed plant-based “meats” like Impossible and Beyond Meat. While these are certainly a step in the right direction forreducing climate impact, ultra-processed plant-based foods are more expensive and less healthy than unprocessed, natural protein sources like chickpeas, grains and nuts, which don’t contain added chemicals and refined oils. However, most of us who have grown up eating meat likely don’t think of these as proteins and don’t know how to incorporate them into balanced, satisfying meals that are part of a sustainable diet. Additionally, eating a diet heavy on processed meat alternatives masquerading as meat is difficult to maintain (as reflected by thedecliningplant-based meat market . You can only eat a plant-based burger so many times and in so many ways before it gets old and you revert back to meat, especially when meat is the direct reference point for taste and satisfaction. Flexitarians, and anyone interested in eating less meat, need to know that there are more options beyond fake meat. There are many healthy, affordable options, and we should educate ourselves and each other onplant-based alternativesand how to prepare them as part of a sustainable, fulfilling and healthy diet. It’s easier than we think, and legumes, veggies and grains are often less expensive than meat and meat substitutes. One issue is that the limited variation of meatless options in the dining halls can become monotonous. However, demonstrating more interest in those options and providing feedback will encourage R&DE to explore more whole-food plant protein offerings. Finally, remember that this doesn’t have to be all or nothing — any reduction in meat-eating helps. Kathryn Lyons ’23 is a senior from the East Bay majoring in Human Biology."
crimson_2023_57,"If you’ve recently treated yourself to frozen yogurt in a dining hall, you might have noticed that it tastes a bit different than usual. But don’t be scared — this is good news. Harvard University Dining Services has finally complied with the requests of vegans on campus to provide us (if I may speak on behalf of vegans with the dessert option of oat milk frozen yogurt. This change is a step in the right direction, but it’s far from enough. Our University must do more to properly accommodate the vegan diet — and even promote it. First, observing a vegan diet is not a quirk or flippant choice. Even though a vegan diet can have a positive health impact, most vegans don’t opt out of the daily joy of indulgent meals for selfish reasons. Instead, veganism is an intentional effort to minimize the suffering of sentient beings and recognize their rights. Going vegan also decreases carbon emissions: According to one 2018 study, it may even be thesingle most impactful wayan individual can do so. Harvard University Dining Services seems hardly beloved by students; some have observed that complaints about food quality, variety, and taste are commonplace. For most, however, an underwhelming lunch can be supplemented by catered campus and club events or Cafe Gato Rojo sandwiches and pastries. Now put yourself in the shoes of a vegan. Get ready to lose various free food events, ice cream trucks, study break snacks, nutritious breakfasts, Sunday sundaes, and the rare delicatesses of HUDS special meals (think a chocolate fountain or personalized omelets . Want a savory brain break? You better hope for hummus, or deal with PB&J’s. Sunday brunches? Enjoy tater tots while your friends eat pancakes, two types of eggs, and three different meat options. Hungry between lunch and dinner? Sorry, but get ready for limited vegan options at the campus cafes. I’ve dealt with these challenges personally and often ask dining hall staff about vegan offerings. While HUDS workers are usually enthusiastic in their search, I commonly come away with the same empty stomach, along with the sense that I was an unnecessary burden. It’s certainly possible to be vegan on campus – it’s just not a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the vegan population on campus is not well organized. There exists a Plant Futures chapter at Harvard, but it is not officially recognized by the Harvard Undergraduate Association. Nor does there seem to be an accurate accounting of the number of vegans on campus. Ultimately, though, the blame for the poor range and quality of on-campus vegan food options lies with the University. I am not demanding that every dining hall becomes fully plant-based overnight (although, I would not complain if that did happen , nor am I asking for subpar vegan alternatives to current HUDS fare. Rather, I’d like to make it clear that delicious and vegan are not mutually exclusive. Our University should put more effort into plant-based food, in order to make the stigmatized yet undoubtedly socially beneficial vegan lifestyle appealing. Harvard has already fallen behind other universities in this regard. I spent the summer studying at the Freie Universität Berlin, where I learned what it means to be truly satisfied by vegan options like individually cooked dishes, several meat substitutes, non-dairy sauces, and even desserts. As of 2021, 34 dining spaces across four universities in Berlin are alreadymostly meatless. Freie Universität Berlin has both fully vegetarian and fully vegan dining halls. Further, Cardiff University in the United Kingdom is working to reduce half of its meat and dairy options by the end of the year. Similarly, at Stanford University, menus are typically over half vegan and four-fifths vegetarian. For now, these standards might sound like unrealistic objectives, but they are real and could serve as a guide for our University. Inclusive dining hall reforms can start off small. A simple step that Harvard can emulate from German universities is indicating the carbon dioxide impact of every meal option. Even if HUDS offerings aren’t 50 percent vegan tomorrow, just adding vegan cream cheese would be nice. In the long run, I hope for a Harvard where anyone considering a vegan diet feels encouraged and welcome to do so. If our University’s mission is to educate the “citizen-leaders” of society, perhaps it should help its alumni lead by the composition of their character and also their plates.

crimson_2023_168,"In a historic move this April, a Texas federal judge moved toinvalidate 23 years of Food and Drug Administration approvalfor the abortion pill mifepristone. Although the Supreme Courthas put this decision on holduntil another appeal can be heard, access to medication abortion remains at stake — presenting the greatest threat to abortion access since the Dobbs v. Jackson ruling last summer. Medication abortion accounted for the majority of facility-based abortions in 2020. The method consists of mifepristone and misoprostol taken together, meaning a withdrawal of FDA approval for mifepristone could affect access to this commonly used form of abortion everywhere. Even states that preserve legal abortion — like our own Massachusetts — could be impacted. Although Massachusetts Governor Maura T. Healey ’92 asserted that pharmacies must supply medication abortion, this case could restrict medication abortion access here. Thus, the outcome of this litigation could restrict reproductive care for all Harvard students. Limiting access to medication abortion will likely disproportionately affect women of color. As we saw after the Dobbs ruling, these women are more likely to receive abortion services, have less access to healthcare, and often face financial barriers in traveling out of state to obtain an abortion. The plaintiffs in the mifepristone case are anti-choice organizations and doctors, represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, a faith-based, anti-abortion law firm. The firm has claimed that mifepristone was improperly approved by the FDA. The doctors who are being represented have also alleged that they were required to distribute a medication that caused adverse effects among patients, even though serious side effects occur in fewer than 1 percent of patients. Judges do not have the scientific expertise to decide the efficacy or approval of a medication, especially when the FDA has already decided this matter. Mifepristone was first approved in 2000 by the FDA and has been used by more than five million people. Overwhelming research has shown thatmifepristone is safe. An order for the FDA to withdraw the approval of mifepristone is an abuse of power by the judiciary system that infringes on the autonomy of the FDA. If this case is successful, the restrictions on mifepristone could set a new precedent for medication access in the United States. Contraceptives are already in a vulnerable position: In his concurring opinion to Dobbs v. Jackson, Justice Clarence Thomas stated that the Court should also reconsider its 1965 ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut, which protected the right to access contraceptives. This could prove detrimental to the access of other critical medications and threaten the integrity of medical research. It’s a dangerous time for a federal judge to stir doubt on the FDA’s authority and approval process. In a 2021 survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health, 24 percent of respondents reported thatthey did not have much confidence in the FDA. A legal decision undermining the FDA could further deteriorate public trust in the organization. While the FDA could technicallytake action to soften a judicial ban, they may be precluded by political leaders and private entities. Walgreens confirmed that it would not sell mifepristone in 21 states after Republican attorney generals sent letters to it and other major pharmaciesthreatening legal repercussionsif they sold abortion medications. In this political climate, a decision in the mifepristone case may be more definitive than it first seems. As a Latina from Texas, legal and political threats to reproductive access are nothing new to me. But studying at Harvard in Massachusetts — a progressive state that has historically protected reproductive rights — I found comfort in knowing that I could access reproductive care. After the Dobbs ruling and this recent litigation, any stability I once felt is hindered. The continuous attacks on sexual and reproductive health made through the judicial system in the last year demonstrate a clear, persistent agenda to undo the progress that thousands of people protested and fought for. The fight for reproductive rights is far from over, and it’s caving in on all of us — regardless of which state we reside in. Correction: September 29, 2023 A previous version of this article misstated that Walgreens stopped selling mifepristone in 21 states after Republican attorney generals sent letters threatening legal action to the company. In fact, no major retail pharmacy currently has permission from the FDA to distribute mifepristone, and Walgreens has not started selling mifepristone. Shania D.

rice_thresher_2023_23,"ByThresher Editorial Board10/17/23 11:43pm President Reggie DesRoches recentlytold Bloombergthat Rice has been struggling to hire faculty due to perceptions of Texas and its politics. The report by Bloomberg found that many professors and instructors that could otherwise have been hired were turned away by the “conservative political environment,” among other factors. Specifically, DesRoches said the problem is convincing prospective faculty to even visit. “If we can get people to Texas, we can get people to Houston,” DesRoches said, “and they can see how cosmopolitan it is, how diverse it is, the rich culture, the museum culture and the music culture, that we do well in recruiting people.” Rice is a nationally-recognized institution that heavily engages with and impacts the Houston community. As new Texas laws limit the activities of public universities, Rice has to use its liberties as a private institution to lead the Southern academic community. It takes recruiting and sustaining curious and cognizant students and faculty to make a tangible difference. A month ago, the Texas Legislature passed legislation banning diversity, equity and inclusion offices at public institutions, causing resources such as the LGBTQ Resource Center at the University of Houston to shut down. In response, Rice Pride, which was not affected because of Rice’s status as a private school,extended honorary membershipto LGBTQ+ students at Texas public universities as a show of support. As much as actions like Pride’s show how important Rice as a community regards diversity, equity and inclusion, Rice nevertheless stands to lose prospective professors and students because of valid concerns over Texas politics. Legislation regarding transgender equality and reproductive healthcare can and do pose genuine safety issues. It’s also important to distinguish Texans from their politicians and separate real political anxieties from existing prejudices towards the region. Misguided, classist conceptions based on “white trash” stereotypes about Texas and the Southern United States don’t help in convincing well-qualified faculty to continue their careers at Rice. The professors who are already here have made great contributions to their fields. Each professor who seeks employment elsewhere is a loss of talent that could make our university better. As Rice goes global, admitting many international students and openingnew centers in Parisand elsewhere, it’s important to be intentional about how it projects the culture of not just the Rice community, but also of Houston, Texas and beyond. Rice must cultivate and actively demonstrate an image of a student body that is well-educated and empowered to lead, learn and compete in a vast array of industries and societies. To foster this image, Rice should show that it is a university responsive to the needs of its students and the wider society by continuing to loudly commit to promoting diversity and free speech on campus. Indeed, therecent reportby the Task Force on Slavery, Segregation and Racial Justice shows Rice’s commitment to addressing the systemic racism long conjoined to the university’s history. We urge prospective faculty to rethink their notions about Texas and the South and to give Rice a shot. Come visit, meet with students, staff and faculty, spend time in Houston and then decide. Consider the consequences of broader Texas politics, as well as the opportunity to affect change yourself. Rice must continue to show that it is a pluralistic, cognizant and dynamic university, leading the Southern academic community and attracting nationwide talent.

stanforddaily_2023_101,"My name is Philip Sossenheimer, and I am one of the resident physicians who has been organizing with the Stanford Housestaff Union for the past two years. The Stanford housestaff organizing committee was invited to present to the Faculty Senate in April to share our motivations around unionization, and also to reaffirm our commitment to the relationship between housestaff and faculty. This was part of a series of presentations meant to inform the Faculty Senate on this topic, and to that end Dr. Laurence Katznelson, Associate Dean of Graduate Medical Education, presented Stanford Health Care (SHC management’s position at the Senate’s last meeting. Unfortunately, only a week before we were scheduled to speak, our invitation was rescinded. While I am disappointed in the decision by the Faculty Senate to rescind our invitation, I can’t say that I am surprised by it. And to a certain degree I can even understand it. The Housestaff Union is new to Stanford, and I recognize there may be fear and uncertainty around what that means for the relationship between housestaff and faculty. I want to be clear that all of us with the housestaff bargaining committee are committed to transparency and ongoing dialogue around these issues. We believe faculty have the right to understand our perspective and that through this conversation we can sustain the Stanford that we love. To that end I want to make available the message that we were planning on sharing at the Faculty Senate, so that any faculty member who wants to understand our position has the opportunity to do so. *** To understand our motivations for unionization I think it’s helpful to remember the origins of our movement. During the vaccine rollout in Dec. 2020 there wereissueswith the COVID vaccine allocation algorithm. This meant that only a handful of housestaff were included in the first wave of vaccinations — despite residents carrying a substantial portion of COVID-19 surge burden — and experiencing some of the most high-risk exposures along with other frontline staff. From where we sit now, vaccinated with multiple boosters and with the mask mandate having ended, it could be easy to forget how high the stakes felt at the time, but for those of us working on the front lines during the surge, being systematically excluded from protection against the pandemic was exceptionally distressing. No other generation of physicians has trained in a pandemic to this scale, and our training is forever imprinted with the experiences of living and working as trainees in an unprecedented public health crisis. To say this time period has been difficult for residents and their families does not fully encapsulate the stress and strain of the realities of our collective experience. But there were moments of hope during the pandemic as well. As a resident body, we saw in real time the power of collective action in response to the vaccine rollout. A group of residents organized a lunchtime unity break and by standing together in solidarity we were able to convince SHC to reverse course andofferall frontline housestaff vaccinations in the first wave. After that experience many residents and fellows began to wonder how else collective action could improve working conditions and elevate care delivery. Within a year we hadlauncheda unionization campaign and won an election with a super-majority of support from residents across from SHC. While the vaccine rollout was a catalyst for this effort, it was by no means the main driver behind unionization. Instead, for many of us, the rollout was a representation of the nature of medical training. It represented the lack of control we have over our working conditions, our personal safety and our increased vulnerability to exploitation. Employees in other sectors have the ability to leave an unsafe work environment. They can apply for a new job, and they can leverage their experience and training to negotiate for a better contract. For housestaff, that’s not an option — we never get the opportunity to individually negotiate our contracts, and if we leave our training positions we may never be able to practice medicine. For us, the legal right to contract negotiation that unionization affords is one of the only ways we can have a voice in our employment conditions. So, why unionize?We unionized because we want to foster a culture within medicine that empowers individuals instead of burning them out to keep physicians in the workforce, a culture that holds advocacy and self-improvement as a professional value, instead of prioritizing traditionalism and sociopolitical inertness. We are not here because we dislike our jobs and want to work less; we are here because we love our jobs and want them to nurture us and foster career longevity. We are unionizing because we care deeply about our programs and want to empower housestaff to make the most of their training. Burnout among resident and fellow physicianscontinuestobea significant issue, and researchshowsthat the quality of our working conditions can have an impact on the care that our patients receive — even the best doctors do not perform as well when they are overburdened and fatigued. That is why our union is bargaining for a new contract that can help address the root issues that housestaff face. We feel strongly that residents should not need to routinely sneak food home from conferences because their grocery budget is tight. That housestaff should have access to safe transportation home if they are too fatigued to drive safely. We believe that housestaff with disabilities should have equal access to call rooms. That lactating mothers who are choosing to come to work instead of spending time with their newborns should have clean spaces close to their work sites so that they can pump breast milk. Fundamentally: we believe that people who dedicate the vast majority of their time to SHC should have a voice in what their contract looks like. For me personally, the reason I have dedicated my own free time to unionize is because it creates this conversation. Before the union, there was no channel for housestaff to speak directly with hospital leadership on an equal footing. Unionization has helped level the playing field between SHC management and the residents and fellows who are an integral part of the SHC enterprise. It is my sincere hope that our union will benefit not only residents and fellows, but also program leadership and departmental leadership. Well-cared-for residents make everyone’s jobs easier. In my own program I have witnessed the struggle to reduce the caps on our services to make it easier for residents to attend educational conferences. I can’t help but wonder how much easier that campaign might have been if there had been a strong housestaff union in place to campaign alongside our program director. I recognize that there might be anxiety about how this will impact the relationship between housestaff and program leadership. Our union is committed to maintaining those relationships. We hope that the presence of a union will strengthen the ability of program leadership to advocate for residents and fellows. I imagine there has been lots of discussion among program leadership around the issue of “status quo protections” so I want to address those directly. Status quo refers to aprovisionin the National Labor Relations Act which bars an employer from unilaterally changing the terms and conditions of employment that are mandatory subjects of bargaining. The key word here is “unilaterally.” Let me be clear: our union unequivocally supports any programmatic changes that are intended to benefit housestaff and serve patient care. If any program leaders want to implement changes to improve working conditions for housestaff — we will support them. Our intention is not to stand in the way of progress. The status quo just means that the hospital cannot make things harder or worse; they can always make things better. The Stanford Housestaff Union is driven by housestaff, and not by a third party. We have partnered with theCommittee of Interns and Residents(CIR to help represent us because they have the knowledge and experience to help us bargain with a very well-resourced hospital administrative team while we simultaneously continue to provide patient care. So let me touch briefly on what CIR is. CIR is the largest housestaff union in the United States, representing over 24,000 residents and fellows across the country. It is a democratically run organization, with leadership composed of elected housestaff from across the country. But when it comes to decisions made at Stanford, those decisions are made by Stanford residents and fellows. So who are we? Well, we are the residents and fellows you work with every day! We have representatives from across the spectrum of specialties, and we have the support of a supermajority of all housestaff. We are surgeons, pediatricians and researchers. We are the first physicians that patients see when they come to this hospital and the last ones they see as they walk out the door. None of us want our relationship with our faculty to change because of this union. I want to end by reflecting on the future of our profession more broadly, and how we can protect the role of physicians as leaders within healthcare. Over the past decade, and in particular over the past three years, we have seen a massive shift in the relationship between physicians and the health system we work in. Where physicians used to largely be independent,a majority of physiciansare now employees of hospitals or other corporate entities. Stanford’s own Dr. Kevin Schulman haswrittenabout this issue, and poses the question of how we can, as a profession, maintain our professional independence as we lose our economic independence. These are issues that we all share — residents, fellows, attendings — and I believe that physician unions, including resident unions, are a valuable part of the solution. Historically physicians have been a fairly apolitical class, but with the change in the distribution of power between various stakeholders in medicine I believe physicians need to elevate our political consciousness and stand together as a profession to advocate for our interests and the interests of our patients. Unionization is not the only tool in our tool box, but it is an effective intervention for training physician-leaders whilealsoimproving their own working conditions. So, while I am disappointed by the Senate removing our invitation to speak, I want to commit to continuing these conversations and remain open to anybody who has questions. I believe the Housestaff Union and program leaders can find innovative ways to improve the working conditions of housestaff and the care that we deliver. Our goal is to make Stanford the premier institution to train at and to perch it at the top of ranked lists nationwide. Thank you all so much for reading.

wildcat_arizona_2023_19,"The desert stretches out beneath a setting sun at Gate’s Pass located at the west end of town off Speedway Boulevard. During a typical Tucson summer, the people are not the only grumpy ones about the weather. Even the birds cease their chirping and the lizards hide in the shade. If you have never spent summer break in Tucson, know that each year, it is a shocking reminder that the desolate desert makes for three months of isolation and monotony. University Boulevard turns quiet and undesirable without the bustling student life to energize it. The once traffic-ridden commute from home to campus during the school year lessens to a breezy 13-minute drive. The sun shoves everyone back inside to their couches and when thunder cracks, we take the warning from Mother Nature to stay put. Year round, Tucson is most enjoyable downtown and across the mountains, but frolicking outdoors was the last priority during a summer ofrecord heatandlimited storms. This year, surviving the heat was no joke, withheat-related deaths amounting to 42inPima County throughout July.Since natural sites likeSabino Canyonand theTucson Botanical Gardenswere off limits during sunshine hours, I struggled to find delight both inside and outside of my home.

After spending the majority of every summer in Tucson, I noticed that they always seem to close with a period of reflection. This year, I was especially uninspired as a local youth. I watched my peers travel overseas and to states as close as those bordering Arizona where they found opportunity and were refreshed. Of course, that is not to say that there were no opportunities on the homefront. There was an abundance of volunteer activities at sites like theTucson Wildlife CenterorBen’s Bells. Internships were also taken up by university students at places likePine Reads ReviewandRaytheon Technologies.As a native Tucsonan, I always had trouble viewing my hometown as a plentiful realm of opportunity. In fact, I saw it as the opposite. It was not too small to be a ghost town, but it was not quite big enough for young people to pursue whatever interested them, either. The fact that some of my peers actually stayed in Tucson for such opportunities made me feel worse about my summer and my own pessimistic mindset. In my head, I was trailing everyone else because I not only lacked the financial security to leave for a substantial period of time, I also failed to take advantage of the chances I did have. It almost felt like a waste working an eight hour shift, coming home and taking a nap every day. My friends kindly tried to reassure me that “At least I was making bank,” and that their money was completely spent after this summer’s travels. But the money I was making was out of necessity and they were “broke” because their families had funds to spare. It was also a challenge to stay off social media in lingering moments of boredom, and it was even worse staying on. I was constantly tantalized by Italian lattes, Hawaiian beach days and gorgeous hiking adventures all overInstagram.At the same time, I knew that if I deleted the app I would feel disconnected from my peers, itching to be let in on their life updates. I kept digging myself deeper into this hole with the depression of not having anyone around and seeing those who were around succeed. This whole time, I was sort of in denial about the fact that I could have been productive right at home but felt too tired and unmotivated to do anything about it. Before college started, my friends and I had summers where our biggest worries were high school relationships and hectic family vacations. Now we are burdened by the whispers of our own anxieties telling us to hurry up and progress our careers. This summer, as I approached junior year, I spent several months worried that stocking shelves and sporting my customer service voice almost 40 hours a week wasn’t enough while all of my friends studied abroad or had research internships. I had to come to terms with the fact that productivity is expensive, and I can’t exactly help my lack of experience. We are all part of a spectrum; college students are trickling into their financial independence and some of us have more to fall back on than others. As much as I can try to find free, rewarding activities to occupy my time, I cannot yet afford to fulfill the dream of traveling to distant lands. For now, I have to stick to what is in my reach and be less hesitant to take on smaller-scale projects. Even though my studies have not taken me abroad, they are still applicable beyond my hometown and I am still able to expand my cultural horizons through local experience. Ultimately, summer break may feel like it’s dragging in the moment, but it is only a few months of a lifetime we have to “figure things out.” Maybe some rest and contemplation are not so bad when the distractions of due dates are at a minimum. This depression was seasonal after all, and it might have been the realization I needed to start the fall semester strong.

crimson_2023_94,"This midterm season, you’ll be hard pressed to find a tranquil, unstressed Harvard student. March is saturated with overlapping deadlines, extracurricular comp meetings, and of course, heavily graded exams. For the majority of students solely focused on being students, the workload is manageable; but for those of us dealing with the excruciating pain of impacted wisdom teeth (without Massachusetts dental insurance , completing assigned work and taking care of personal health feels nearly impossible to balance. Wisdom teeth are the third set of human molars that typically emerge during the college years, between the ages of17 to 25. For the fortunate ones, wisdom teeth erupt upright, perfectly aligning with their existing teeth. However, for the unlucky ones like me, our mouths are too cramped for our wisdom teeth to develop correctly. The third molars become entrapped behind the crowded gum or jawbone, resulting in anunbearable pulsating painfrom tension and bacterial infections. As a first-generation low-income student (and immigrant , I never learned the inner workings of the United States healthcare system. Deductibles, copayments, PPO plans, and all other terminologies are — after six years in America — still strange to me. Despite the growing inflammation and pain in my gums, my initial reaction was not marked by concern. I expected that a prestigious institution such as Harvard would prioritize student access to medical care whenever needed, or so I thought. In Massachusetts (and at Harvard , every student is required by law to have health insurance, whether it is provided by the university or they are covered by a “health plan of comparable coverage.” Based on my understanding, a significant proportion of affluent students already covered by excellent private insurance plans decide to waive their automatic enrollment in the Student Health Insurance Plan to de facto lower their cost of attendance. Conversely, students on significant financial aid, who may lack private health insurance, qualify for need-based grants to offset these expenses. However, there is a separation between essential health insurance and other medical costs such as dentistry, and the SHIP only provides dental coverage to students until age 19. Despite their inherent necessity, there are no financial aid grants designed to cover “non-essential” medical insurances, regardless of current coverage or financial need. After a few back-and-forth calls with Harvard University Health Services, unreturned calls to local dental schools, a series of painkillers, and advice to travel back home for wisdom tooth removal surgery, I learned my first hard-to-swallow Harvard reality: While wealthy students have the economic resources to afford private care, and in the worst case scenario, travel to see a doctor over the weekend, I am stuck in Massachusetts, unable to afford neither medical attention nor a plane ticket back home. As my midterms approach, academics slowly fall on my priority list. The throbbing, pulsating pain in my teeth, gum inflammation, and low appetite remind me that even at an institution like Harvard, my socioeconomic status defines my capacity to succeed. While my peers can study for their exams, all I can do is ponder if my teeth will get any worse. The Harvard Diversity and Inclusion mission aims to eliminate socioeconomic barriers to Harvard’s transformative experience, ensuring that “where one begins does not determine where one ends. ” Yet the College has failed to address the large number of disparate issues a diverse student body faces. For the first-generation, low-income community, access and understanding of all-encompassing health insurance is not granted, yet personal health is indispensable to reach the famous intellectual transformation Harvard preaches. Not covering dental insurance for students with financial need is a policy failure that hurts only the lower socioeconomic end of Harvard and cultivates inequalities in student potential for academic well-being. This dental insurance policy is only the tip of the iceberg of Harvard policies that continuously alienate first-generation, low-income students. FGLI individuals come into Harvard unprepared, without reliable and accessible sources of information to navigate complex bureaucratic systems and academic adversity. These differences on the playing field most likely account for the42 percentof low-income students that, despite attending Harvard, never become wealthy adults. Teaching students healthcare literacy, especially those whose financial constrictions severely limit their experience within the complex Harvard world, is essential to level the playing field and close the achievement gap between low-income and wealthy Harvard students. This includes ensuring that financial aid covers all forms of medical care — including dental care — that are necessary to fully focus on academics and reach the full potential that Harvard facilitates. In other words, provide students with the wisdom necessary to succeed, without forcing them to worry about their painful (wisdom teeth. Steven Giraldo ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Elm Yard. CORRECTION: March 1, 2023 A previous version of this story stated that 98.2 percent of low-income students who attend Harvard never become wealthy adults. In fact, the figure is 48 percent."

The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Israel is a special place and arguably the most misunderstood in the world. We will be celebrating Israel’s 75th birthday at Rice, commemorating the occasion with a conference hosted by the Baker Institute on April 27, 2023. It is important to understand that the Jewish connection to the land of Israel goes back thousands of years. Jews werealwaysin this land before Israel was created. As I prepare to graduate, having founded aStudents Supporting Israelchapter at Rice, I want students to be informed about Israel and Palestine. There are many people who spew misinformation and will not want to listen to facts because of the false narrative they love to believe. I want to celebrate Israel, as the ‘‘Israel at 75’’ event at the Baker Institute plans to. However, Students for Justice in Palestine at Rice is demanding to cancel the event. SJP is a national organization rooted inviolence. They call for boycott, divestment and sanctioning of Israel. In doing so, this hurts Palestinians. For example, when Ben and Jerry’s decided to remove their stores in the West Bank as an uninformed political statement, they hurt the lives of thePalestinians they employed. In 2018, SJP at the University of California, Irvine was placed on atwo-year probationdue to their actions against an Israel culture club hosting a movie screening for “discriminatory and disruptive behavior again against Jewish and pro-Israel students.” I hope students recognize the hypocrisy anddangerof their ideas. They are adangerto those with opposing ideas and I hope Rice students can conduct their own research on what SJP does and what SJP says they do around the country. The Palestinian Authority used 8% of its budget as of 2017 in order to paysalariesto terrorists or the families of terrorists who murdered Israelis. The deadlier your attack, the bigger payment your family receives. This policy is known as thePay for Slay policythat the U.S. Congress voted against in a bi-partisan law called the Taylor Force law. Taylor was a U.S. Veteran andVanderbilt studentwho was murdered by a terrorist that got rewarded for the killing. The hubris of college students around the U.S. that claim apartheid and war criminality, especially at Rice, do not understand the Palestinian experience. In no way does Israel represent an apartheid and theclaim is ridiculous. The boycott, divestment and sanction movement repeats this lie loudly and ceaselessly. I encourage anyone who is unfamiliar with the topic to find out what it’s like to live in Palestine territory and talk to those who they wish to support. I also want Palestinians in the Middle East to not feel displaced and to have a stronger feeling of home, but this should not come at the expense of Zionists who are willing to find ways for both people. I want to thank Rice for the opportunity to attend “Israel at 75” and a chance to learn more about how world leaders are addressing the conflict in Israel and Palestine. I would have to wait 25 years for Israel’s 100th birthday to know where the next big celebration is and I definitely won’t have an opportunity to attend an event quite like this one ever again. I will always have hope for a better future. I will always stay informed. Spreading hate is never the way. Many people act out, but we all have the power as leaders to right the wrongs of past generations. Let’s work to unite people with correct information and a will for peace and collaboration. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

ubyssey_2023_29,"March 28, 2023 Written byDana Turdy It all started with a tweet, a TikTok and a Youtube video essay. Okay, let me finish. This is not the latest trend you need to get on, a supposedly empowering “fuck him, you could do better” self-help article or a 12-step skin care routine that will magically wash away all of your relationship problems with the help of a Vitamin C serum. Rather, what if I told you we have been brainwashed into perceiving relationships in a certain way? What if I told you that social media makes this perception worse? I, like many other Gen Z-ers, indulge in a TikTok scroll from time to time. Who can’t resist the instant dopamine fix? The funny videos where you think, “OMG that is so me. How did they know?” Feeling incredibly guilty after watching some influencer get up at 5 a.m. and do more in a day than I’ve accomplished in a week. All while taking care of 5 children. And a full time job. TikTok’s powerful algorithm always seems to know when I’m “going through it.” It was a source of comfort for me when I broke up with my high school boyfriend, and afterwards when I tried my hand at dating and ill-fated ‘situationships.’ I would scroll through TikTok after TikTok with women who would tell me I needed to “be more toxic” and play with other people’s feelings in order to forget about the ones who had hurt me. Influencers who would joke about the dozens of guys they were talking to, all in an effort to enact some sort of “revenge” on their cheating ex. Other ‘empowering’ videos about how “if he wanted to he would.” That I should never settle for less than the best. I didn’t even have to communicate my needs, the right guy should just magically know. And buy me flowers every day on top of that. All of thiswassomewhat comforting at first, at least in a hedonistic kind of way. Maybe I shouldn’t be putting all of this effort into dating men. Maybe they were doomed to fail because all men are toxic. Maybe I should just focus my romantic efforts on women. This is what I would say to my girlfriends, as we all complained about our love lives and how menjust don’t understand. Maybe we are all doomed. And then I watchedthis video essayby Sisyphus 55, a Youtuber who goes to McGill (and who I matched with on Tinder not too long ago… if you’re reading this let me take you out for a drink . In the video “how we think of love is messed up”, he discusses Simone de Beauvoir’s theory of love inThe Second Sex. In contrast to ‘ethical’ love, there are forms of failed love, one of them being founded upon narcissism. The relationship of narcissism is described as “loving one self and loving in the other. Many of us have dated someone because we have low self-esteem and the relationship makesusfeel good — their love is validating. You start to depend on that validation — it’s satisfying knowing that someone can know how messed up you are and still want to be with you. As someone who struggles to form secure attachments with other people (thanks mom and dad! , this really resonated with me. One of my fatal flaws is that I’m easily influenced by other people’s opinions of me. When, inevitably, I’m faced with rejection, my self esteem takes a huge blow. That person didn’t like me becausethere must be something wrong with me. By depending on this kind of validation in narcissistic love, maybe we start to expect that our partners should meet all of our needs, all the time. If not, they can be discarded, like objects, until you meet the next best thing. TikTok says that our partners should make us whole — as if humans are inherently broken or empty in the first place. “If he wanted to, he would.” Well, maybe he just doesn’t have the capacity for that right now. Or maybe you haven’t been communicating your needs properly. Anothervideo essayby Youtuber oliSUNvia also touches on this topic. No matter how compatible you are with someone, they shouldn’t have to just magically know what you need or want. While it might seem scary to be honest and vulnerable with someone else, open communication is unfortunately an integral part of long-lasting and healthy relationships. While you shouldn’t expect everything out of your relationships, they also shouldn’t be transactional in nature. I saw atweetrecently about how, as an adult, you shouldn’t ask your friends to help you move. Just hire movers instead. This is an unfortunate but common phenomenon in the hyper-individualistic culture present in many Western countries. Why shouldn’t we depend on our loved ones for help? Personally, as someone who admittedly needs a lot of help, my friends have saved my life countless times. They do so without question, without judgement,if they have the capacity. We’ve all fallen into the trap of thinking in ECON 101 terms (not to re-traumatize you . It’s really a cost-benefit analysis at that point isn’t it?How much I’ve done for you vs. how much you’ve done for me.I’ll treat you to coffee because you bought it last time. While seemingly innocent at first, this can be detrimental to others and ourselves. The reality is that our relationships may never be 50/50, because humans are complex creatures and we all have different needs and capacities. We have different cultural contexts, different financial circumstances. I have definitely indulged in complaining with my friends about everything we do for our partners. Is it really love if you’re doing things in expectation of something in return? A similar kind of TikTok preaches about how women should have higher standards and that we should expect men to pay for everything. I’ve joked with friends about how this is ‘reparations’ for the patriarchal society we live in. I’ve listened to friends complain about first dates where the guy didn’t pick up the bill. People are starting to treat dates as a financial trade-off.He bought me dinner so I’ll indulge him on a second date. Obviously, it’s nice to get treated to dinner. But isn’t it harmful to start expecting this out of dating, when supposedly you’re there to get to know each other? I think we all have a role in perpetuatingarchaic gender norms, and in the name of being ‘equal,’ we reinforce the same heteronormative ideas that people are fighting hard against. Of course, this is not to shame others. I recognize the environment we’ve all been dumped into is dire. Dating apps make it incredibly easy to use and discard other people with a swipe of the finger. Isn’t it so much easier to ghost someone instead of just saying how you feel? Another favourite Internet Thinker of mine, Rayne Fisher-Quann, discussesthis ideaabout how people commodify themselves for the sake of the Almighty Algorithm. Doesn’t capitalism train us into thinking of human beings as commodities? Disposable. Anything in the name of profit. Maybe the dating world is as bleak as I described, or maybe we can start to release ourselves from the chains of hyper-individualism and transactional relationships. Either way, I am a strong believer in the power of love. Love in all forms, platonic, familial, romantic. I can’t overstate how many times love has saved my life. It’s the best part of being alive. It’s the best part of being human. Dana Turdy is a fourth year political science and sociology student. This is a commentary article.

crimson_2023_129,"There is no good word for scrapbooks made out of obituaries. Robert “Bob” J. Quinn, who started cutting obituaries out of newspapers in 1983, originally called them his “AIDS Memorial Books.” He completed 26 volumes, containing more than 7,000 obituaries in total. The memorial books,now digitized, are a testament to loss and remembrance. HIV/AIDS killed many, many people during the epidemic that spanned the 1980s and 1990s. Since the start of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, an estimated 675,000 Americans have died from the disease. More than 40 years later, it is apparent that we will never know the name of every American who died of AIDS. Combing through Quinn’s memorial books, what sticks out most to me is that he literally highlighted people who were never in the headlines, their names in oranges, pinks, and yellows, with years of deaths written in blue, red, or black in the margins — loss in technicolor. Reading these obituaries and annotations provides a stark and painful reminder of persistent loss; when going through the memorial books, it becomes almost overwhelming. Quinn himself had AIDS, and spent time as a patient at the Hospice at Mission Hill in Boston. John J. Podolske, Quinn’s eventual healthcare proxy, met Quinn as a volunteer at Mission Hill in 1992. As Podolske said of Quinn, he was “the type of person you never forget.” “​​He did those books because he wanted to make sure everybody got remembered, and he knew a lot of people that passed away too,” Podolske explained. “He didn’t want the AIDS crisis to be pushed as a non-memory thing. That’s why he did the remembrance books, and he did it for as long as he could,” he added. Quinn pored over newspapers, carefully clipping obituaries for the blur of names, faces, and too-young ages dead from the disease he was struggling with. The obituaries were sometimes for people Quinn knew personally, friends now reduced to a few biographical lines. Quinn kept persisting in this exercise, knowing that his own name could end up in the obituary section one day yet likely never a memorial book. Podolske witnessed Quinn “right up near the end” as “he kept going on those books, collecting those obituaries, making sure nobody was forgotten.” “Those books were one of his high priorities,” Podolske said. Patients at Mission Hill typically had six months or less to live. Quinn “way outlasted six months,” according to Podolske. *** Podolske described one of Quinn’s other favorite things to do: acquiring collector plates. “There wasn’t a week that went by that he didn’t get a collector’s plate in the mail,” Podolske said. However, after six months, Podolske said he saw a change in Quinn: “I think he started getting depressed being in there, with watching everybody come in and die around him and he was still around.” So Quinn left. “The room he was in was on the higher side of the building,” Podolske described. “So, this one morning, he just hung himself out the window and dropped, something like a 12-foot drop, and he ran down and took off.” Quinn ended up on an Amtrak train to his hometown, Albany, N.Y. After he was eventually brought back to the hospice, it was determined that he was “too well” to be a patient there anymore. In lieu of continuing to stay at the hospice, Quinn was moved to an apartment across from Symphony Hall, where he became known for his annual Christmas parties — each party his “last,” since Quinn didn’t know when AIDS would finally kill him. As Podolske remembered, “I think we ended up having eight annual Last Christmas parties before he finally died.”When Quinn died in 2002 — far outlasting the six months that Mission Hill had expected — Podolske ended up taking care of his estate, sorting through Quinn’s specific instructions on distributing his plate collection. Podolske, a Vietnam War veteran, got a plate commemorating the Vietnam War. After Quinn’s funeral, his friends and family held a “big party at his apartment” — which felt more like a celebration of life rather than a rumination on death. “He wanted people to live, that’s really what it was,” Podolske said. All these years later, Pat Gibbons still remembers Quinn. She remembers him collecting the plates (she believes she received one commemorating Ellis Island , and assembling the memorial books. When I asked her what she remembers from the Christmas parties, she said, “They were wild. I mean, he was just so funny,” emphasizing the words. Gibbons opened the Hospice at Mission Hill in 1989, serving as its first director. The hospice was intended as a place for people in their final stages battling with AIDS to pass in peace. Through my interviews about the hospice, one phrase kept coming up — that Mission Hill was a “special” place. For many patients with HIV/AIDS during this time, hospices provided a sense of comfort and acceptance which was difficult to come by; people with the disease were often stigmatized, and even rejected by their friends and families. Liz Kass, one of the first medical directors of Mission Hill, described the importance of providing housing and medical assistance for vulnerable, particularly unhoused and marginalized, populations: “People who would come from shelters or prison, or just sort of ‘street existence,’ you put them in a room, you actually gave them their medication regularly, and fed them. And lo and behold, although they looked like they were dying when we admitted them, they weren’t with a little bit of housing and care.” “Shocker, right?” she added. As Brad A. Gregory, the former head chef at the hospice who worked at Mission Hill from its opening to its closing, told me, “We were determined to make the place a home. We had an army of volunteers, people in the community who just said, ‘I want to help, how can I help?’” Gregory’s culinary creations worked to make the hospice more of a home. “I started doing holidays … we’d do crepes and pancakes and all sorts of things on Mardi Gras … and Christmas and Thanksgiving and Opening Day at Fenway Park, anything I could think of to make a themed luncheon or dinner,” he said. The hospice also had some notable visitors. When Elizabeth R. Taylor, a prominent AIDS philanthropist and actor, was in Boston promoting a new perfume, she pulled Gibbons aside and expressed her desire to come visit the Hospice at Mission Hill. “And she did,” Gibbons said. “Liz Taylor came and spent the entire afternoon and met with every single resident.” Baba Ram Dass, a guru and psychology researcher at Harvard who led the countercultural push for psychedelics, also visited the hospice. “I was awestruck in his presence. He would stop into the kitchen and have tea with me,” described Gregory. For many of the employees and volunteers at the hospice, their endeavor in caring for patients with HIV/AIDS was deeply personal. As Gregory said, “Many of my close friends came to the hospice and ended their lives there.” Although he noted that these tragedies happened at different points in his life, Gregory remarked, “I did two tours of Vietnam in the late 60s, early 70s, and the AIDS epidemic was my trial by fire. I have to say, the war was less emotionally taxing.” Even dealing with death, the staff of the hospice wanted to practice comfort and honor. As Gibbons described, “What we always did was when someone died, that room would remain quiet for 24 hours after the death, and we would make a point of putting something that either meant something to that person or something that would remind us of that person in that space for that period of time, to honor the fact that they were there.” They would also place a candle and a card for the person who had passed near the entrance of the hospice. Mission Hill needed to both honor losses and maintain a hopeful environment for current patients. “There were a lot of really lovely things and a lot of really difficult things,” Kass, the former medical director, said. Looking through Quinn’s digitized memorial books hurts. Conversations play out on the cut-out pages, as families describe the lives and wishes of the deceased and hope they are now in a better place. But this can only ever be a one-way conversation. As the years inch on and we move further away from the start of the AIDS epidemic, we risk remembering only statistics. But numbers cannot communicate the personal nature of loss. An empty seat at a breakfast table or a side of the bed no longer used cannot be felt in a minus sign. What’s missing from the equation is grief and loneliness: love with nowhere to go but to a beneficiary six feet underground or sitting on a mantle. When I look at the memorial books, I think of all the parts of people’s lives that couldn t fit inside the word limit of a newspaper obituary announcing that they died of AIDS. When thinking about Quinn himself, I think of his Christmas parties and his plate collection, undercurrents of joy and hope which revealed so much more about who he was than a simple line about a diagnosis. I think about the employees and volunteers who gave so much of themselves to the Hospice at Mission Hill, and how they showed up to help some of Boston’s most marginalized and vulnerable. Learning from their examples, we must work to show up for people in our own communities, to see the life of each person around us as the complex tapestry it is. From supporting people with HIV/AIDS today to ensuring that places like Mission Hill can be created in the future, caring about the most vulnerable members of our communities starts now. *** The Hospice at Mission Hill has long since closed. But the ways in which it helped people both live and die must be remembered. During our interview about what it was like working at the hospice, Gregory told me, “You don’t get prepared for letting go of the people that you’ve become a very intimate friend with over an intense period of time.” The quiet over the phone was loud. He continued: “I say that and in the silence here, faces come up. Faces that I remember very intensely.” Shanivi Srikonda ’24, an Associate Editorial Editor, is a Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentrator in Quincy House."
state_press_2023_41,"ASU s dining hall meal plans are mandatory, expensive, inaccessible and average at best When I opened the finance tab in my student portal and saw the $2,840 charge for my semester-long meal plan, I was once again reminded of the waste of money that are the dining options at ASU. Last semester I made the mistake of choosing the unlimited meal plan with limitless swipes and $300 in M&G, which I paid $3,015 for. All first-year students and upper-division or graduate students living in traditional residence halls are required to purchase a meal plan. Little did I know, the real limit to that meal plan would be the quality of the food itself. I quickly realized the dining hall was not great. Not terrible, mind you. But not great. As the semester progressed, the quality seemed to get worse. In the few days before winter break, the dining hall had cut its food offerings down to sparse, precooked food sitting under a heat lamp along with toast and bagels with no cream cheese. As a consequence, I ended up living off of takeout and food from the market I hadn t budgeted for. This experience pushed me to opt for the cheaper 14-swipe-per-week plan with $425 M&G, but more importantly, it left me with a few questions. Why am I forcedto pay for a meal plan that I don t end up using? Do the dining halls actually listen to student feedback? What do other students think? I reached out to the University for comment but did not receive answers to my questions. At a forum hosted on the Downtown Phoenix campus in January, representatives associated with Sun Devil Hospitality, previously known as Sun Devil Dining, responded to student concerns about food quality, specifically finding hair in food multiple times, being served undercooked chicken and getting sick. In response, Bryant Newman, Sun Devil Dining resident district manager, apologized and implored students to give instant feedback. Give us that feedback, Newman said. If it s something that you see or you re getting something that s not of quality, let us know right away and we ll address it immediately. But do the dining halls actuallylisten to this feedback? Jordyn Walhof, a senior studying public policy, political science and anthropology, was in attendance at the forum. Walhof has attended forums in the past and wasn t optimistic about the implementation of feedback. Every semester, they tell us that they re going to do different things and maybe one or two of them have happened, Walhof said. While dining staff might say student feedback is vital, the reality does not entirely reflect this. Big promises are great, but when you have not been delivering on the small, important details, it s worth stepping back and addressing those first. UA has optional meal plans; however, as of next fall, meal plans will be required for freshmen. A similar plan at UA to my meal plan at ASU would cost $100 less while giving me the same amount of meal swipes per week and $375 Dining Dollars, UA s equivalent to M&G, when split into two semesters. READ MORE:Opinion: On-campus living expenses prohibit equal opportunity for education NAU offers regular and platinum options for its meal plans with 14 and 19 meals a week. A regular plan similar to mine would cost $65 less and give me the same amount of swipes and $100 Dining Dollars, while a platinum plan similar to mine would cost $73 more, also with $100 Dining Dollars. Most colleges explain mandatory meal plans by arguing it is for the student s good. According toBest Colleges in 2022, required meal plans for first-year students makes sure they have access to a sufficient amount of food while studying and minimize the amount of food and cooking in residential halls. Aleeza Feffer, a freshman studying biomedical sciences who was not at the forum, deals with a multitude of dietary restrictions. They re (dining halls mid, she said. I get the Barrett dining hall which is a little bit nicer, but from what I ve eaten, nothing s been amazing and it s really hard for me to eat because I have dietary restrictions. Feffer said information on food ingredients at the dining halls is hard to find, making it difficult to find options that fit. Sun Devil Hospitality has awebsitethat features daily menus with food ingredients for all dining halls but it s never accurate, Feffer said. The website reads, Due to ongoing supply chain disruptions requiring ingredient substitutions, allergen and ingredient information on menu boards, recipe cards, and website may not be current. If you or someone in your party has a food allergy, please contact a food service manager, chef or dietitian on site. Not only are students paying for food they don t especially like, but students are also paying for food that does not always accommodate them. So again I ask, why? It’s important to note that, at the University, you can get anexemptionfrom the meal plans, albeit, these exemptions are considered for those with either a documented medical condition or a religious dietary observance. So students like me with neither of these prerequisites would not be allowed to opt-out. To me, it seems like the answer is obvious: make meal plans optional. Allow students like me, who don t like the food, and students like Feffer, who can t eat all of the food, to make our own financial decisions.

crimson_2023_82,"Prominent Harvard speakers and community members convened last week for the2023 Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Forum, themed “Reckoning and Transformation.” In the quest for “healing, restoration, and accountability,” this forum aimed to “elevate and prioritizetruth-seeking and reckoning with our past in order to more fully understand our history and actions.” Despite such ambitious aspirations to amplify Harvard’s institutional and systematic approach to diversity, one thing feels missing from the campus discussion of social justice: our role as society’s most privileged few. We are told from the day we open our acceptance letters that Harvard is home — that we belong. But for the vast majority of applicants, let alone people, Harvard will never be home. Harvard has made strides in improving racial diversity on campus, with consistently growing proportions of non-white students ineach class year. However, our student body continues to hail from disproportionate wealth, with over two-thirds of Harvard students coming from the top fifth of the income distribution. Over half of Harvard students come from families in the top tenth of income earners, and nearly two-fifths of students in the top five percent. And more than one in every seven Harvard students comes from a family in the top one percent earning more than $630,000 every year. These numbers should force us to acknowledge a fundamental paradox in our home. We imagine it to be a beacon of equity and inclusion; at the same time, we enjoy its benefits out of an inherently hyper-elite and privileged position. I will not speak for anyone else’s experience at Harvard, and my intention is not to criticize any individual. Rather, I question how our community appears so hypersensitive to the inclusivity of one of the world’s most exclusive bubbles. Each of us, many on the basis of wealth or familial connection, has been granted rare access into this space. And yet we debate inclusivity without any accountability, lacking any urgency to understand our own privileges as beneficiaries of this hyper-elite institution. The quest for diversity at a campus like Harvard may forever be constrained by the fact that, if unchanged, our institution will never reflect the society in which we live. For some, this is undoubtedly why Harvard is special: The access to a network of powerful, wealthy, and influential individuals it provides is unparalleled. But for others, it’s why this institution can feel suffocating: We observe necessary conversations on equity and diversity dominated by highly privileged individuals posing as authoritative figures on social justice. Should we simply shrug our shoulders and cede to privilege and power? No. I firmly believe that the constant pursuit of equity and inclusion is so vital that it merits and necessitates rigorous discussion. Rather, we need to address the overt contradictions in our approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion. It’s time to acknowledge that it is an immense privilege to philosophize on class and inequality in the comfort of a seminar or attend spiffy forums on political inclusion at the Institute of Politics, while simultaneously living a life with resources that the vast majority of people can only imagine. We should grapple directly with the contradictions that permeate Harvard, like the elite social clubs, long reserved for the most connected and well-endowed, that simultaneously seem to have made diversity and inclusion a priority. These contradictions should raise questions, concerns, and, most importantly, the standards we set for ourselves when we discuss — and practice — social justice. I will never fully understand why an institution like Harvard, so exclusive and inaccessible, continues to dominate global discussions surrounding equity and justice. But I do know that some pills are tough to swallow: in this case, that the oppressive structures we read about, write about, and criticize in our classrooms are the same ones that brought many of us to this campus. Over the course of three days, the EDIB forum grappled with pressing issues ranging from environmental racism to this institution’slegacy of slavery. We would all do well to participate in these kinds of conversations. What does it mean for us to unpack the intersections of class and global warming at an institution whosefossil fuel investmentsmake up over a billion dollars of its endowment? How do we grapple with our institution’s deep ties to slavery as residents of undergraduate houses, like Mather and Winthrop, thatmemorialize our slave owning affiliates? These questions, I hope, can drive us beyond ostentatious and limited discussions of social justice that dismiss ourselves from any accountability and instead move us towards recognition of our status as some of the greatest beneficiaries of the structures we often vehemently condemn. Perhaps this article falls victim to its own critique: Only a privileged Harvard student would nitpick diversity initiatives from within his Cantabrigian sanctuary, as if anything he says could have a tangible impact beyond the walls of the ivory tower, and Crimson Editorial editors like myself have long positioned their overintellectual complaints as real movers of change in op-eds like these. But I have faith that there is meaning in questioning our assumptions, approaching our daily conversations with greater intention, and reckoning with the fact that in our very own pursuit of equity, we benefit from the most inequitable positions of privilege.

thetech_mit_2023_14,"The following stories were collected from seven Master’s and/or PhD program alumni who endured severe and prolonged bullying from the same advisor at MIT. Their experiences span 14 years, from when the first of them joined the group to when the last left. All of them suffered deep injury to not only their careers and wellbeing, but also the scientific rigor of their research. By silencing dissent, shutting down inquiry, and demanding that data be massaged to fit pre-existing theories, this advisor and his unchecked abuse directly threaten MIT’s fundamental mission and its reputation for expanding the bounds of human knowledge. These alumni do not share their stories to disparage the Institute, but rather to highlight the failures of current policies in responding to cases of advisor abuse. They implore the MIT administration to listen to grad workers and accept the MIT GSU’sproposed grievance procedurefor harassment, discrimination, and bullying. This change would offer grad workers suffering advisor abuse real protection and recourse, thus making MIT a better place for both researchers and research. In the following paragraphs, we will refer to the alumni as Alums 1-7. A ubiquitous theme in the alumni stories is that the professor, as Alum 5 put it,“rules by fear.” All the alumni report regularly seeing members humiliated in front of the rest of the group. Alum 1 recalled “Once, in front of a bunch of other people in the lab, he scolded me, saying ‘When someone smarter than you tells you to do something, you need to do it!’” Alum 5 remembers “watching him berate some of the research scientists in our group.” But the mistreatment wasn’t just in public — Alum 2 recalled that “My advisor quite often bad-mouthed a student behind his/her back to other students.” Some of the advisor s behavior was so perversely bad that it bordered on surreal. Upon learning Alum 4 was using mental health services to work through the stress of supporting their ailing father, the advisor was incensed and criticized them, saying “You’re sick. How can I work with you when you’re sick? This is why we are not making any progress.” This professor also exploited students’ desperation to graduate and leave the group in order to extract further concessions. “For students on the verge of graduation, my advisor would threaten to withhold thesis approval unless excessive additional work was completed.This tactic was applied indiscriminately; every student that I knew during my time with the group was subjected to it, with some of the highest performing students facing the most outlandish demands,” said Alum 6. Alum 3 corroborated this account, saying that the advisor “agreed that once I reached a certain result, I would be ready to graduate, but once I produced the agreed upon result he said, ‘I know I said that… but what we really want is something else .’I was completely powerless; I had no choice but to do as I was ordered.” All of this mistreatment took a serious toll on the grad workers. Alum 1 stated that their “career was derailed” and that they are “years behind where I could be in life” because rather than spending time learning valuable research skills, they “wasted so much time trying to survive in and then escape a toxic lab.” Several alums reflected on the high frequency with which students who entered the lab intending to complete a PhD left with a Masters: “When I look at the ‘alumni’ of his lab, I realize that almost all of them I know intended on earning a PhD with him, but instead left the lab with a Master s (like me or without a degree at all.” Alum 6 said the toxic environment was a “major contributor to my decision to leave the school after completing my Master’s degree, despite my original intention to pursue a doctorate” and that it was “a sad end to my relationship with MIT — the place I had called home since my undergraduate days.” The professor’s cruelty not only affected the grad workers in the lab but also tainted the science that they were producing. Alum 4 said, “​​When conducting research, I believe ideas should be met with skepticism and challenged based on their strengths and merit. While working with my advisor at MIT, I did not feel this was how research was conducted. Rather, I found that anything I said that may contradict my advisor… was met with swift verbal attacks on my character, competence, and way of thinking.” Alum 3 recalled that, when questioned, the advisor would often respond with insults such as “Are you going to stop talking garbage?” and that once the professor even “pounded on the glass table, shouting ‘NO!’ to make me accept that I was wrong and that the matter ended then and there.” Alum 2 noted, “If he believes an idea of his should work like a charm but you bring back negative results, rather than focusing on investigating what went wrong, he tends to feel offended, blame you for not doing things right, and lash out his frustration on you.” Alum 7 recalled that “He was latently aggressive in his style of management… truthfully, parts of me were afraid of him – or rather, of the power he held over me. I quickly recognized that nodding my head and doing as I was told would heighten the chance of avoiding conflict.” Alum 3 recalled a time when they had discussed a research question with another professor when their advisor “would simply not accept that certain assumptions he held were erroneous.” When the advisor found out that Alum 3 had consulted another scientist who had agreed with the student’s analysis, “He threatened that since I had zero results after more than a year of working with him, he might give me a fail for my thesis.“ This stain on the scientific method often led to, as Alum 2 put it, “weak and questionable results that must be packaged by my advisor’s top marketing skills in order to be sold to sponsors.” This environment, in which scientific inquiry is systematically quashed, taints all research it hosts and has the potential to undermine MIT’s reputation as an elite academic institution. Some alumni in this lab tried to use MIT’s existing resources to resolve the situation. Alum 1 went to the Office of the Dean for Graduate Education (ODGE — since renamed OGE when the advisor was withholding approval for graduation, and was told that resolving such advising issues is the primary reason for the office’s existence. However, while the deans offered some emotional support, they were unable to offer real solutions and, by their own admission, had no ability to protect anyone from retaliation. Alum 6 consulted with their department’s graduate student office and “looked for other means of reporting the situation.” But ultimately, most alumni came to the same conclusion as Alum 5: “None of the resources I found gave me confidence that substantive, corrective action would have been taken, particularly without compromising my own prospects for a timely graduation. Ultimately, I resigned myself to simply tolerating the situation and getting out as soon as possible — the dismal, practical course of action that every generation of the group s students has been left to take.” Sadly, despite efforts to address these issues, things have not changed. “In speaking with recent members of the group, I am deeply disappointed to hear that the intervening years have seen no change to the group experience. My advisor’s abuses have continued, unchecked,” says Alum 6. While the OGE is staffed by caring and empathetic administrators who can offer emotional support, they have little power to enforce change. Meanwhile, MIT and IDHR have clearly stated during bargaining sessions that IDHR (Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office focuses exclusively on harassment and discrimination that is targeted based on a protected identity. This notably excludes power-based harassment, meaning that MIT still has no formal process to address abuse at the hands of an advisor. This is exactly why we need a different system — a grievance procedure — that empowers grad workers to seek recourse until a resolution is achieved. In spite of this, MIT has argued in recent negotiations that our union should be contractually barred from filing any grievances around harassment, discrimination, and bullying, despite the fact that, by their own admission, the policies that failed these alumni have not been changed. Our union is demanding a revised system to address advisor abuse and other misconduct that runs rampant in the current system. We are fighting for: The right to file grievances about bullying and identity-based harassment, thereby empowering workers to address and seek recourse for these mistreatments; A clear, fair, process for handling misconduct which prioritizes improving the well-being of the student above all other considerations; The right to a trained, experienced, and legally protected union steward at the grad worker’s side through the entire conflict resolution procedure, so that no one has to navigate these problems alone; and The right to escalate adjudication to a third party arbitrator (not an Institute-affiliated group if cases cannot be resolved through mutual discussion. Harassment, discrimination, and bullying happen at MIT, and the current systems to address these are inadequate or nonexistent. With our proposed grievance procedure, grad workers will have the support we need to fight for the treatment we deserve. Adam Trebach is a 6th year PhD Candidate in the Physics Department. He has been organizing with the MITGSU since 2018. Update 03/10/2023: A previous version of the article featured an inaccurate statement about graduate students access to IDHR; students do have access to IDHR, though IDHR s focus excludes power-based harrassment."
rice_thresher_2023_62,"ByPaul Mayer2/14/23 11:39pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Over the past year, the back-and-forth between science educator Professor Dave and Rice’s own James Tour has reached a new level of fervor, accompanied by name-calling, accusations of dishonesty and hordes of angry YouTube comments. To Professor Dave, Dr. Tour misunderstands origin-of-life research and purposely misrepresents the field. Dr. Tour, on the other hand, claims his issues with OOL are based on the science itself and expresses concern that the public and students are misled about OOL research. Beneath all the incivility are two people who seem to care very deeply about science and science education. I encourage the Rice community to focus on the science itself, not any of the personal attacks. In the past, I was not a fan of James Tour and bought into the depiction of him as a religious fundamentalist who prioritized converting students over teaching them science. As a result, I understand why Professor Dave and his audience could think that Dr. Tour has a religious agenda. Dr. Tour is an outspoken Christian and even hosts Bible studies with students (which he has every right to do . But when I attended a talk by Dr. Tour, he was nothing like the rumors suggested: he did not mention any miracles or God at all. I began to share his concern that claims by science communicators and introductory textbooks discouraged students from entering the field of OOL. I was also concerned that Professor Dave was blinded byhisown views and presuppositions about Dr. Tour, a concern that grew larger after watching his recent video “The Delicious Unravelling of James Tour,” which did not feature much science at all. Instead, Professor Dave came dangerously close to expressing the same anti-Christian and anti-religious sentiments touted by New Atheists who have fallen intomoral dogmatism. Their back-and-forth misrepresents the usual civility and charity that characterizes serious academic discussion. Constant character attacks, allegations of fraud and dishonesty and armchair psychoanalysis are not how scientists resolve disputes. Rather than responding to these claims, the Rice community must uphold its commitment toexcellence and integrity, and instead respond to the quality of research and the arguments themselves. Both Dr. Tour and Professor Dave are excellent teachers and share a similar goal of teaching science. Dr. Tour won the George R. Brown Award for Superior Teaching two times while at Rice (in 2007 and 2012 . Professor Dave has millions of subscribers and has helped countless students learn chemistry (including some at Rice . Consider the irony that there are people at Rice taking Dr. Tour’s organic chemistry class and using Professor Dave’s videos to help study for exams, leveraging the expertise of both to understand the material better. The two are great at explaining science on YouTube, so it is only when their conversation reaches a personal level that it ceases to be worth watching (save for entertainment . I now think that many of the accusations against Dr. Tour are unprofessional, unprovoked and baseless. Professor Dave is more responsible for the current hostility for directly targeting Dr. Tour and his religion, as Dr. Tour has repeatedly statedhe believeshis religion plays no part in his scientific work. If someone came after me and my work on the basis of my personal life, I would not hesitate to respond. Additionally, I would expect my colleagues to come to my defense, not necessarily for my own sake but to remind the public that data and experimentation are paramount to science, not personal belief. I’d argue further that their silence here is unacceptable: if someone criticized another scientist on the basis of other personal characteristics like their race or gender, I would similarly expect researchers to quickly dismiss such nonsense. Because we attend a leading research university, we each share the responsibility of demonstrating to the publichowresearch is done. This means coming to conclusions based on the strength of the evidence, not who is the loudest, flashiest or funniest. I implore my fellow students to listen to both sides with an open mind, not with the intention of discrediting either Dr. Tour or Professor Dave. You may even learn some chemistry in the process. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

state_press_2023_16,"If we don t become incredibly overzealous with our desire to replace ourselves with AI, it will never take our place in delivering face-to-face care. Recently, the use of artificial intelligence systems such asChatGPTandMidjourneyhas skyrocketed. Since many ASU students selected and started their degree programs before this significant rise in technology, they are left to ponder the implications of AI’s potential future impact on their chosen fields. While the rise in artificial intelligence is a threat to some fields, many still require a human touch which is why ASU students in certain fields shouldn t worry about their job prospects being negatively impacted by AI following graduation and instead should use it as a helpful tool. In 2021, Knight Foundation announced a new$3 million initiativeto help news stations use AI to their benefit. The top use of AI in these projects was augmenting reporting capacity, where AI took on the responsibility of combing together data and finding breaking news. In this case, AI makes the reporting process quicker, but much of the actual writing and fact-checking still falls on journalists. The content-creating process, as it stands now, is more effective when humans are doing the creation. AI can aid people in content development but is not yet at the level where it can create and publish content without some sort of human interference for clarity or fact-checking. I would still choose journalism as my major, even if AI was a factor. It s something I love doing, and human passion beats something created by a machine any day, said Kia Brown, a freshman studying journalism. As for myself, I chose my medical studies major in early 2022. ChatGPT was released inlate November 2022. Had this technology been around when I applied to ASU, would I have decided to pursue another major? I doubt it. As a pre-medical student, I am fairly confident that AI will not get rid of my job prospects any time soon. There has not yet been an invention that has led to the decimation of a particular medical specialty, and the overwhelming majority of specialties require frequent patient interaction. If we don t become incredibly overzealous with our desire to replace ourselves with AI, it will never take our place in delivering face-to-face care. I think AI will definitely impact the medical field simply because AI is becoming a very prominent feature in almost all professional pathways, said Sindhu Jayamani, a freshman studying medical studies. However, I believe that regardless of what AI is developed in the medical field, the most reliable caregiver would not be an AI. Some slip-ups by the AI, if it is perhaps performing a surgical procedure, cannot be foreseen. If it is not prepared to deal with them, lives could be lost, Jayamani said. Other non-AI technologies, such as theda Vinci Surgical System, have become increasingly prevalent in hospitals across the nation. Famous fordoing surgery on a grape, the robot was simply being controlled by a surgeon. In this regard, I find the use of technology to be a positive force, assisting skilled workers rather than stealing their job. Despite the security of some fields, it is important to take into consideration that the automation of just a handful of other fields could have negative effects on everyone. At the end of the day, humans must look out for humans rather than technology. For example, AI is creeping into many non-degree-required fields.Truck drivingis a field that is increasingly being impacted by the rise of AI. According to theMcKinsey Center for Future Mobility, autonomous trucks will be implemented in four phases. The last phase, which will result in the complete automation of truck driving, is expected to roll out within the next decade. According to the US Census, there are over3.5 million truck driversin the United States. The Phoenix metropolitan area has one of the highest levels of employment for truck drivers in the country, with almost29,000 truckersbeing employed. This means that within the next decade, 3.5 million people, including almost 29,000 drivers located right in Sun Devil territory, could potentially be forced out of their current field of work. This possibility has huge implications for the economy, transportation and unemployment rate. We are at a major turning point in the history of technology. 120 years ago, we flew the first plane. Over 50 years ago, we landed on the moon. And just 16 years ago, the first iPhone was released. Now, we have come so far in our quest to advance that we are inventing technology that has thepotential to overpower its creators. The current state of AI doesn t pose a huge threat to all professional fields. In many cases, it can be a helpful tool. While AI becomes more advanced, though, we should still make sure to put people first and tread carefully. The advancement of AI is a new, exciting possibility, but we cannot afford to get too far ahead of ourselves. We created the world around us. It is important that we remember to save room for ourselves, no matter how impressive our creations are. Edited by Kate Duffy, Jasmine Kabiri and Grace Copperthite.

wildcat_arizona_2023_2,"Energy drink illustration by Seal Margalit. Energy drinks have rapidly become more prevalent on college campuses. Since most students don’t get enough sleep, energy drinks offer consumers more caffeine so they can stay awake longer and be more alert. However, consistently drinking them can be extremely harmful. TheCenters for Disease Control and Preventiondefine an energy drink as “a beverage that typically contains large amounts of caffeine, added sugars, other additives, and legal stimulants such as guarana, taurine, and L-carnitine.” In 1997, Red Bull wasintroducedto the U.S., and since then, hundreds of other brands have been created and their primary market is college students. Energy drinks are notregulatedas food but as supplements, so manufacturers can add more caffeine. TheFood and Drug Administrationsays 400mg of caffeine is the maximum amount a person should have daily without adverse health effects. But this is only for adults in pristine health and only for an occasional drink, not relying on them to make it through the day. For context, a standard 12 oz.Red Bullhas about 114 mg, and a 16 oz greenMonsterhas 160mg. The energy drinks marketed as “healthy,” likeCelciusandAlani Nu, have 200mg in their 12 oz. cans. The obsession with these drinks is prevalent throughout campus. I don’t think there’s been a day where I don’t see multiple people drinking them. All markets on campus sell them, and I have seen people giving them out at the UA Mall for free. Not only do energy drinks have a lot of caffeine, but their other ingredients are also unhealthy. They have a massive amount of sugar, and theAmerican Heart Associationrecommends 36g of sugar for men and 25g for women. A standardRed Bullhas about 38g, agreen Monsterhas 54g, and Celsius and Alani Nu drinks are “sugar-free” but containsucralose, an artificial sweetener. Another thing taking over college campuses is the use of pre-workout. Like energy drinks, pre-workout offer a boost of energy to complete a workout. Most pre-workouts have the same ingredients as energy drinks, butsomecontain steroids banned by the NCAA.Mostpeople don’t need pre-workout because they can receive energy from a balanced diet. Energy drinks should not be mixed with alcohol. Since energy drinks have loads of caffeine, they can conceal the depressive effects of alcohol, causing the consumer not to realize how much they have had until it’s too late.Four Lokoswere banned because they contained three stimulants, caffeine, taurine and guarana, and one depressant – alcohol, and they have since been rebranded only to contain caffeine and alcohol. Drinking many energy drinks per week can have awful side effects, especially on your heart. They cancauseheart palpitations, heart rhythm malfunctions and increased blood pressure and heart rate. If minors drink energy drinks, there are even more ramifications, like insomnia, stunted growth andcardiovascular anomalies.Mostenergy drink companies have warnings on their websites saying their products are not recommended for children, but studies have shown that67%of adolescents have consumed energy drinks. There aremanyother healthier ways to get caffeine, like green tea, black coffee and dark chocolate. I have fallen victim to consuming energy drinks a lot, especially during finals, to get an extra boost, but I try to stop myself because I have been addicted to them. They offer a temporary boost but can have lasting effects. Follow Kelly Marry onTwitter Kelly Marry (she/her is a sophomore studying journalism and public relations.

stanforddaily_2023_3,"I read with interest theemailthat the President and Provost sent to the Stanford community with regard to the efforts of Stanford graduate students to unionize. Unfortunately, it contains some basic misunderstandings regarding this activity. I am writing this piece because I believe that if Stanford is going to move toward a more equitable and just set of working conditions for its graduate students, a better grasp of the issue is warranted. I speak as someone who was involved in organizing as a graduate student at UC Berkeley, and who has maintained a keen interest in this topic. This past December, I devotedan episode of my podcast, “Speaking Out of Place,” to interviews with student organizers, strikers and faculty at not only four campuses in the University of California system, but also with their counterparts at theLondon School of Economics and at other universitiesand colleges in the United Kingdom, who, as part of the massive University and College Union (UCU , were also on strike. Of the many notable things I learned was that the activists on both sides were very aware of what was going on across the Atlantic, and that their goals and values were very similar, as were their grievances. What we are witnessing is a seismic shift in post-secondary education and the conditions under which people work. Let me quote this part of the President’s and Provost’s letter to the Community, which captures the core of my concerns: We encourage every graduate student to consider closely what it means to become a member of a union, what it means to engage in collective bargaining and what it means to have their educational experience governed by a collective bargaining agreement. It is important to note that, if elected, the union will represent not only today’s graduate students, but also future graduate students, who will not have the same opportunity to vote on union representation. The impression one gets from these words is that many of the graduate students who are embarking on this effort are naïve and unfamiliar with unions, collective bargaining and the effect unionization might have on future graduate students. It suggests that, rather than work under a collective bargaining agreement which they have helped create, graduate students might prefer to work under conditions over which they have no control, that is, the status quo. The Graduate Student Council’s recentvote of no confidencein the administration should give pause. In fact, the campaign at Stanford is not unlike the efforts at the UC system, at UCU in the United Kingdom, or the efforts we see at Princeton, Harvard, Duke, Columbia, the New School and elsewhere. So far, in the United States nearly 30,000 graduate students have unionized. Most of these endeavors have beenyears in the making.Some have been in process for nearly a decade, as working conditions for graduate student workers across the US have steadily deteriorated. Most graduate students consequently know more about this topic than many administrators and faculty — they, not administrators or faculty, have to deal with these radically diminished conditions every single day. To give a vivid account of their concerns and beliefs, I include below samples of comments I gathered. I cite UK organizers at the London School of Economics on various topics and their counterparts in the University of California system to convey how the grievances of Stanford graduate workers are not at all unique, either in this country or in the UK even. When one realizes this, one can gain a better sense of the dimension, duration and depth of these issues. Finally, and very importantly, one should recognize that unionization enjoys a great deal of support from undergraduates, who have spoken at pro-union events and rallies. Graduate students, despite their overwhelming burdens, have shown themselves time and again to be empathetic, diligent and caring. I repeatedly heard testimonials from undergraduates to that effect. Their support for graduate students might be summed up in a statement that was made often — “the only people on campus who actually know my name are other undergraduates, and my TAs.” To conclude, the administration’s letter ends with assertions of care — but after years and years of neglect, something more than fine words is necessary. Those involved in the effort to unionize know full well that it is extremely unlikely that they themselves will benefit in any way from their efforts. They are working for a union out of a profound sense of obligation to and solidarity with all those who will follow. They do not wish on others the suffering they have endured. And they also do this out of a deep commitment to quality education — they feel that the conditions under which they are forced to work make it nearly impossible to be the teachers, and researchers they wish to be. I write this because I care about Stanford, and I worry that if we go forward without fully understanding the nature of the fight for unionization — why it is necessary, and just how deeply its supporters understand its nature and importance — we will not have the kind of productive discussion we need."
crimson_2023_109,"When each of us joined in the decade-long battle to divest Harvard from coal, oil, and gas, we understood that it was a key part of the fight to slow down climate change by reining in an industry that had gone rogue. We backed up the students leading the fight in every way we could think of, helping organize everything from faculty resolutions to alumni office sit-ins. We were overjoyed in 2021 when Massachusetts Hall finally acknowledged what students had been saying all long: As The Crimsoneditorialized at the time, “Our investments matter. They showcase our ideals and our moral character… Harvard’s decision to free itself from fossil fuel investments shows our commitment to reducing the extent and impact of climate change.” But the story isn’t over yet. Harvard’s faculty and staff, and many other college instructors and workers across the country, are still — though most of them don t know it — profiting from climate change through their vast retirement plans, invested by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. TIAA’s portfolio — $1.2 trillion with a T — makes even Harvard’s endowment seem puny, and it is heavily invested in climate destruction. TIAA, through its in-house asset manager Nuveen, is the world’s fourth-largest holder of coal bonds. It has sunk huge sums in tar sands companies like Enbridge, which paid local police departments to crack down on Indigenous protesters trying to stop its Line 3 pipeline in Minnesota, and in corporations like Exxon, which use the money to open up still more new oil fields, long past the time when it was obvious that needed to stop. TIAA even created shell corporations to grab land illegally in the Brazilian Cerrado, a biodiverse savanna that borders the Amazon — funding deforestation that has become a mortal threat to the people who’ve long lived there and to the planet’s biology. We could make a long and strong financial argument against these investments. The fossil fuel industry has for a decade underperformed the market, and dramatically. It appears to have gained a temporary bounce last year when longtime industry friend Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, but fortunately, war profiteering has a short half-life. Hydrocarbon prices have already resumed their decline — a decline likely to continue as renewable energy grows ever cheaper. TIAA claims it has a “fiduciary duty” to act in its clients’ interest. But as Tom Sanzillo, who once oversaw New York state’s massive pension fund, has put it: Not divesting runs counter to that fiduciary obligation, because funds without fossil fuels do better in the long run, avoiding volatility, stranded assets, and coming crashes. But there’s an even more important argument to be made. Of all the investors in the world, TIAA may be the most hypocritical, because the people it purports to represent are precisely those most revolted by the ugliness of their policy. TIAA handles pensions mainly for university educators and staff, doctors, nurses, and medical researchers. That is, its money comes from the natural scientists who first diagnosed the climate crisis, the social scientists who have worked out its economic, political, and psychological dimensions, and the clinicians who treat the casualties it creates (recent evidence: one human death in five comes from breathing the byproducts of fossil fuel combustion . We don’t want our life savings invested in things that shorten the lives of our fellow human beings or make the planet unfit for everyone’s retirement. All of us are educators — we’ve given our lives to the cause of preparing young people for the future. Why would we want to foreclose that future? It would be one thing if we had no alternatives. But these same universities have helped work the clean energy miracle over the last few decades. From our labs have come the innovations that have helped to make pointing a sheet of glass at the sun the cheapest way to generate power on planet earth. Of course it’s worth investing in solar power, wind power, and the batteries to store the energy they produce! This is why so many academics have demanded that TIAA change. From the State University of New York system, to the public universities in oil and gas states like Colorado and Montana, to Ivy Leagues like Cornell, more than 1.7 million educators have gotten behind theTIAA-Divest! driveto reform the giant fund. Harvard needs to join in this fight. It’s time for a faculty resolution calling on TIAA to put an immediate moratorium on any new fossil fuel investments and to get out of the land grab business. We don’t need ‘cleaner options’ to let some people tidy up their portfolios and their consciences; we need comprehensive action now, on a scale commensurate with the crisis we face. Since we’re both teachers, let us add one more thing. In different ways, our work has explored one of the central and now indisputable facts of the climate crisis: The big fossil fuel companies knew about global warming decades ago, and they lied about it. Exxon, for instance, was warned about the greenhouse effect by its own scientists and later started building its drilling rigs higher to compensate for the rise in sea level they knew was coming. But they didn’t tell the rest of us: Instead, the industry invested in a vast campaign of denial and disinformation. This kind of intellectual dishonesty would get students bounced from our classes and professors from our faculties. If our profession’s commitment to, um, Veritas means anything, it should certainly get these investments bounced from our portfolios.

rice_thresher_2023_15,"ByThresher Editorial Board11/7/23 10:53pm Afterseven studentswere transported to the hospital at Night of Decadence Oct. 28 and the public was shut down nearly two hours early, Dean of Undergraduates Bridget Gormanannouncedthat all publics through spring break would be canceled and Pub Night would be only open to 21+ students until further notice. Many students have responded with upset and even anger at this decision, sharing thoughts on Fizz and creating petitions about the matter. While it is fair to be sad about the loss of some important college traditions, we need to consider how severe the alcohol situation on campus has gotten to necessitate this decision. Rice has a unique social system where parties are funded by the university and have thoughtful infrastructure. Though socials heads, chief justices and caregivers did all they could to keep NOD under control, the situation quickly escalated beyond their capacity. It is completely reasonable for Rice to worry about legal liability at a public it funds. In addition, Pub has facedmultipleinvestigationsfrom the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, so it is right to treat the bar with diligence to ensure its continued existence. We are lucky to have such a strong safety system at publics, one that students at other universities and bigger state schools often do not have, but that does not mean we can take advantage of it. As we emphasized in ourprevious editorial, CJs, caregivers, security volunteers and other students responsible for planning and executing publics have done nearly all they can to educate students about safe drinking practices and to create supportive environments at the publics themselves. At the end of the day, it’s up to the student body to realize that something has to change, or else we will risk the loss of traditions for years to come. A petition by college socials heads does bring up the point that seniors in particular have lost years of college traditions due to COVID. We empathize with this situation and encourage administration to find ways to allow seniors one last opportunity to experience the traditions that make RiceRicenext semester. While this may not be completely walking back the decision to cancel publics through spring break, students already have plenty of ideas of how we can incorporate these traditions in different ways. From supporting public-themed Pub nights to restricting publics to juniors and seniors only, the student body could have a voice on how to best allow seniors to experience their last bit of Rice culture. However, we also must acknowledge that the decisions the administration has made in an attempt to keep campus drinking under control were not entirely out of line. After we stretched thin the capacities of on and off-campus assistance, Gorman’s decisions could have been far more drastic. The alcohol policy has not been changed, college nights are still allowed and smaller parties within colleges have not been banned — ultimately, campus did not go dry. While publics are great, they’re not the only fun on campus. This decision demonstrates that having traditions carry on is not a guarantee when the safety and legal risk is too great for the university. If we want to have Beer Bike and publics resume post-spring break, as well as a reason for Gorman to not make campus dry, we need to use this time to show we can drink responsibly and in moderation rather than see it as an opportunity to continue drinking heavily and unsafely, even in smaller settings. We need to be smart and safe — at the very least, these seniors deserve a final Beer Bike.

thetech_mit_2023_6,"This newspaper is undergoing an existential crisis. There are not enough staff members and not enough money for it to continue to exist. The money problem can be fixed with help from its 1,200 alumni. But they can’t come back and put out the paper and maintain the website. That requires student staff. I hear you asking, “Why should I care? It’s just another club. Clubs cease to exist all the time.”The Techis the only club at MIT specifically mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. It is not a club. It is a news organization. Because I’m an old-timer, let’s call it a newspaper. I’ll bet you care about MIT’s reputation and rankings, since they affect the value of your degree. There is no major university in America without a student newspaper. No moreThe Tech? That’s a distinction that will devalue your MIT degree. Why does this matter? As Thomas Jefferson said, “were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.” I would rather haveThe Techwithout MIT than MIT withoutThe Tech. Every public institution needs to be held accountable by a free and independent media. “What’s in it for me?” That depends.

state_press_2023_36,"Protesters march past the Memorial Union at the Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault protest on Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022 in Tempe. The demands of ASU activists and students have been repeatedly dismissed and ignored by the University, even when those students and other local community members have been engaged in peaceful protest and engaged in talks with the administration. Meanwhile, ASU continues to support its police department, that said in an email statement it can assist if events become disruptive to the campus. ASU and its students should recognize and take action against the inherent danger police pose to environmental activists and other needed social movements. The University should also fulfill the demands of progressive student groups instead of strengthening policing that impedes demonstrations that drive change. At ASU, multiple organizations have made demands for broad changes to University actions and policy and have had bad experiences with ASU PD. Our experiences with ASU have been consistently negative since we were founded 10 years ago. As individual sexual violence survivors, we have been mistreated by ASU staff and police, silenced by ASU investigations, and denied mental health and academic accommodations, said a representative of Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault in an email. SDASA is a support and advocacy group not affiliated with the University. It hasproposed the Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education Centerand demonstrated several times on campus demanding for the establishment of the center and in support of other groups and other issues. READ MORE:Student groups protest for better sexual assault services from ASU We would like to see the University stop retaliating against activists by threatening and taking disciplinary action against us. We would like to see the university take sexual and relationship violence seriously, which requires greater investment in prevention and victim services, the representative said. Young Democratic Socialists of America at ASUpreviouslyran a campaign for a Green New Deal and ASU divestment from fossil fuels. Even recently, you ll see climate activists like Greta Thunberg getting hauled off by the cops because policing is integral to the maintenance of the protection of all these forms of capital flow, said Sam Ndinjiakat, a sophomore studying sociology and political science. READ MORE:Opinion: University s claims of sustainability are false and manufactured Ndinjiakat said the University had time to act on their demands. Quite frankly, I would consider it shocking that they wouldn t have time considering they spend so much time talking about how they re such a green university … time definitely should not be a restriction for a University that claims to have nationwide acclaim in regards to sustainability initiatives, Ndinjiakat said. #CAARECenterNowprotest at#ASU!pic.twitter.com/5qthfVEg3V Jim Wisehart, a senior studying philosophy and a member of Students For Justice in Palestine at ASU, said there was never any progress in the meetings with the administration and that they brushed us to the side. The only time that administration has sat down with us and asked us what our goals are was when we had a protest, with at least 100 people, (who marched to the administration building where they locked the doors and wouldn t let anyone in, even though everyone was an ASU student, Wisehart said. It wasn t until after those events that they contacted us. Student activists and organizations have gone out of their way to sit down with the ASU administration and have relatively non-disruptive protests, but to no avail. One has to wonder what tactics would eventually make the University act on some of the demands students have asked for; if it won t happen through non-disruptive means, how far would students have to go? However, if students were to use disruptive means, it is clear what stands in their way. The ASU Situational Response Team is lead for monitoring campus protests. The SRT are staff members trained to help manage such events. The team falls under the Dean of Students Office. ... To protect the ASU community, the SRT can call in ASU Police to assist if it appears violence may break out (or does , or if the event becomes disruptive to the campus, an ASU spokesperson said in an email. Wisehart said at a protest againstformer Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaiospeaking on campus, ASU PD didn t help protect student protesters from outside groups. These aging men in biker jackets show up to our campus and are standing outside of the room where Sheriff Joe is and they escalated the situation, Wisehart said. Some of them even start to assault students. One of them was waving some sort of baton that they were hitting students with. And guess who was right there watching it all happen? ASU PD didn t do a single damn thing. ASU has made its priorities clear. It has allowedbigoted speakers on campusand continues to have its own police department while students and their needs are left in the dust. The school would be much improved if it implemented the demands made by students. Yet, in its continued ignorance of student movements and its emphasis on a police department that could be used to suppress students who try to disrupt the status quo, it is clear that students needs are not prioritized. Given the danger that policing poses to student movements and the University s own dismissal of student organizations, ASU students and workers should organize to demand better.

state_press_2023_0,"A member of the No Both Sides rally holds out a microphone to the crowd as they chant outside Old Main on the Tempe campus on Saturday, Oct. 21, 2023. Whether ASU intends to or not, the institution is instigating conflict on campus when it allows extreme political figures like former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio to speak on inherently racist ideas while simultaneously not granting a platform to other political figures. College Republicans United at ASU(CRU announced Arpaio’s return to campus to talk about his time as sheriff and his stance on immigration for the second time in five years. Local Arizonans, like myself, are well aware of the policies and beliefs of the former sheriff, who served in the role for decades before 2016. In 2016, I remember eagerly following election coverage on television, following the Maricopa County Sheriff race even closer than the presidential race. I could not bear another term under Arpaio’s influence. This view was not uncommon among both my liberal and conservative peers. READ MORE: A slap in the face : Students protest Joe Arpaio s CRU-hosted visit to ASU After evidence of Arpaio s racial profiling against Latinos during immigration sweeps and traffic stops was found in 2013, a district court ruled that the policies and practices of Arpaio s office were discriminatory, violating the Fourth and 14th Amendments and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If that wasn t enough, America’s Toughest Sheriff openly believes that former President Barack Obama s birth certificate was forged despite there being no evidence to support his claim. This is the kind of person ASU welcomes to speak on campus. This is neither the first time ASU has scheduled an appearance from Arpaio following his 2016 reelection loss to Paul Penzone nor the first time ASU allowed an appearance from a controversial political figure. Turning Point USAat ASU, which has hosted conservative figures Charlie Kirk and Denis Prager on campus, was recently under fire following the assault of ASU instructor David Boyles. A video of the members of the organization showed them pushing Boyles to the ground after harassing him. ASU released a strong-wordedstatementafter the assault took place, saying, ASU will do all that we can to end the bullying and intimidation of our faculty members by Turning Point USA. READ MORE:Students, faculty frustrated with Turning Point USA and ASU after altercation involving faculty member President Michael Crow said the school is waiting for a police investigation to conclude before deciding the University s course of action. When Crow was asked about the incident during a meeting with The State Press, he said when a group is invited to speak on campus, the answer will almost always be yes, no matter who it is. Are we going to allow people that have been invited by people associated with the University to speak on campus? Crow said. The answer is freedom of speech is a very broadly conceptualized thing. And the answer will be almost always yes. ASU needs to answer the question of where it draws the line when a figure is too dangerous for a platform. Crow vouches for free speech when 91-year-old Arpaio wants to share his views on immigration but will ax the appearance of an incumbent congressional member. This semester, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich, the only Palestinian member of Congress, was invited by theArizona Palestine NetworkandStudents for Justice in Palestine at ASUto speak on campus. Since ASU strongly supports free speech, you d think she d be given the same respect as Joe Arpaio, Charlie Kirk and several other controversial figures invited to speak on campus. Still, ASU canceled the event the night before it was scheduled to take place. The event featuring Congresswoman Tlaib was planned and produced by groups not affiliated with ASU and was organized outside of ASU policies and procedures. Accordingly, that event will not take place today on the ASU Tempe campus, an ASU spokesperson said in an email. Members of SJP at ASU said the event has been in the works for months. This last-minute cancellation led to anger, confusion and, most importantly, protest by the student body, leading to one arrest. If ASU truly cares about the safety of its students, it needs to do a better job of giving everyone an equal playing field or nothing at all. READ MORE:Rep. Rashida Tlaib calls into pro-Palestine protest after ASU cancels event When ASU fails to provide sufficient reasoning for depriving one incumbent politician from speaking on campus while adequately providing a platform for a disgraced county sheriff, the message regarding free speech is unclear to the ASU community.

stanforddaily_2023_82,"By Sebastian Hochman Being an artist should be as much a part of Stanford culture as someone wanting to patent an app or train for a Mars mission. What will it take for that culture to change? At a time when other universities are struggling to keep their humanities departments, Stanford’s commitment to the arts has the potential to pave the way for thousands of institutions across the country to follow suit. It’s not at every college that you learn that the lead singer in your band is planning on becoming an astronaut. Coming into Stanford this year as both a frosh and as an artist, there’s constantly been some sort of tension. Throughout New Student Orientation and the first few months here, I began to notice a consistent reaction when I would respond “music,” to that now-dreaded, “what’s your major?” The response would be one of several options: “That’s so interesting,” “Music and…” or “Oh, haha. I’m in a major that I know I’ll make money from.” Here’s a common scene for me: I walk into a room of new people, playing some of the best jazz I’ve heard college students play. We begin to introduce ourselves. One by one, the musicians go around, talking about what they’re studying.Biomechanical Engineering,Aeronautics and Astronautics,International Security, and then we get to me.Music. Just music. It’s intimidating, to say the least. What does it mean to be an arts major at Stanford? The school, known around the world as the leader of STEM and startups, is not a place commonly thought of as a welcome home for actors, musicians and other artists. People like me so often are cast as side players in a drama that puts science and math as the central theme. And yet, I was told I have a place here. Of course, Stanford still attracted students like Ted Danson, Reese Witherspoon and Adam West (none of whom graduated, in pursuit of eitheractingprofessionally ortransferringto a more rigorous program . Still, the question I and all my peers in the arts seem to be asking is: Can an artist find their place at Stanford? It wasn’t always this way. “In the seventies,”said Jim Nadel ’72, the founder of the Stanford Jazz Workshop (SJW , “There were around 200 music majors… It was quite a different scene.” The Stanford Jazz Workshop (SJW is an internationally renowned organization dedicated to jazz education through summer camps, workshops and jam sessions on campus. When he attended Stanford, there was no jazz department, but the amount of music majors then was over six times the current amount. Nadel chalked it up to it being “a different time… It was possible to live in San Francisco, pay rent, run a non-profit that didn’t pay much. There was a larger desire for experimentation and the US was in a totally different economic universe than we’re in now.” In other words, not everyone at Stanford was focused on landing six- and seven-figure salaries. However, he attested that there are currently more jazz musicians than ever at Stanford. Why? “I think word has gotten out that Stanford is a great place for jazz music… If you’re interested in jazz and something else, it’s hard to find a better place than this,” Nadel said. You can see this in action at the CoHo’s Monday night jazz jam sessions. Truly incredible musicians playing next-level jazz. Their majors? Physics. Math. Computer Science. Maybe a minor in music, sometimes even a double major. It seems like there’s a distinct difference between these arts-interested people and the more intensive cohort of artists, those who wish to pursue a career in the arts. Something giving all Stanford artists hope is the newlylaunchedinterdisciplinary arts minor (inter-arts minor as well as the Honors in the Arts Program. “It’s true that there aren’t a lot of art majors at Stanford, comparatively,” said Jessi Piggott Ph.D. ’19, associate director of the Stanford Arts Institute (SAI , who develops the inter-arts minor and Honors in the Arts program. “It’s a small but mighty group, but the students who are in that group are fiercely committed to the arts.” I really find value in these programs. There’s a lot that is great about the idea that non-artists and artists alike can have an opportunity to combine forces and create great work in all sorts of fields. The minor allows the student to pave their own pathway through the world of interdisciplinary art through three years of study, while the Honors in the Arts is a year-long capstone program with a focus on interdisciplinary artistic study. “Art classes at Stanford are so over-enrolled,” said Jessi Piggott Ph.D. ’19, the associate director of SAI, “Students want art to be a part of their life, there’s just no question about that.” It’s true. There’s an overwhelming demand for arts practice classes. I have friends who’ve declared an arts practice minor as early as their first quarter just to get into them. And that’s the kicker, right? If you’re interested in the arts and something else,it’s hard to find a better place. I know that’s why I’m here. But now, after having been here for two full quarters, I’ve realized it’s difficult to imagine a world as an artist after Stanford. The “Stanford” instinct for the arts is often “how can I apply my arts to an alternative career,” instead of “how can I make a career out of my own practice?” What Stanford needs is a stronger focus on letting artists be artists. The same kind of career planning that exists in the STEM world needs to exist in the arts at Stanford. Piggott told me about the idea of “the fuzzies and the techies” at Stanford —atermthat’sthesubjectofnumerousDailyarticles. A “techie” is someone who studies STEM, while the “fuzzy” studies humanities or arts. I ask you, dear reader, which term sounds more pejorative? Being an artist here should feel different. I spoke to a handful of students and artists in my own dorm who agreed that they would be more likely to pursue the arts if there were more solidified arts resources. Someone who is extremely passionate about creative writing should not need to major in CS or Econ just because of a fear of going out into the world as an artist. Stanford students are often among the best in their field; not all careers may roll in the same amount of cash, but CS, Engineering and Econ aren’t the only career options. It’s important to acknowledge this truth that with a degree from Stanford (whether in biochemical engineering or clown-ology , you’re better off than those same degrees from other institutions — an arts degree from Stanford could likely take you further in life than any degree from other institutions. It’s a privilege that’s built into the University after all these years. But we shouldn’t rest on our laurels. Stanford needs stronger support for artists to use their skillsas artists. Often, there’s an atmosphere of “as a creative writer, you should go into marketing and use those skills,” or “as a theatrical improviser, you could use that in your job at a quant firm when things go south to ‘improv up’ a solution.” As artists, there should be more clear pathways for us. This could look like several things. There could be a program for visual artists to learn how to get their artwork into galleries. There could be a course entirely on how to promote your music as an independent artist or how to get signed at a label. There should definitely be even clearer options for summer work as artists. Meanwhile, artists at Stanford are deprived of the same depth of faculty offered to other fields. There are many incredible visiting artists at Stanford — Joshua Redman is a great example. He’s probably one of the (if notthe world’s best saxophonists, and he is sharing his craft with students here. But arts hirings like that are not yet institutional. Redman is still a visiting artist, so there’s no saying if he will remain a part of Stanford for future years. What’s needed are more arts professors who are serious practitioners in their fields and have decision-making positions within their departments — and are here to stay. This could mean giving certain current lecturers and guests more power or prominence within their fields. Their permanence and stature will not only allow students to be more confident in choosing to stick with the arts but it has the potential to bring in a multitude of new students who might otherwise be attending arts conservatories. “I like to think that the idea of the fuzzies and the techies is outdated,” said Deborah Cullinan, Vice President of the Arts at Stanford. I asked if there was a possibility that the fuzzies and techies were merging in this new era. “That’s why I do what I do,” she said. “We all need to live creative lives.” She insisted that artists are welcome at Stanford. “Some students are here to be musicians or visual artists or poets or performers, and that is as valid and valuable as those of us that might be here to study computer science or be policy makers.” She added that being an artist here isn’t just about careers, it’s about how you engage with the world. “It’s about how you live that creative life and how you access creativity,” she said. Personally, I think a major in interdisciplinary arts could be invaluable for the arts at Stanford. “I think more people need to know there is that kind of demand,” Cullinan said. Being an artist at Stanford is a student right but it’s also a privilege. As such, it’s important for the school to prioritize funding for arts students who lack resources, just as Stanford does with its STEM students. Otherwise, “we run the risk of Stanford arts being only for ‘the privileged few,’”said A-Lan Holt, director of the Institute of Diversity in the Arts (IDA , who added that racial justice and equity need to be considered in any discussion around the arts curriculum here. For the arts to succeed at Stanford, the school needs to have a culture shift. Or perhaps a shift toward culture. That means putting resources towards arts faculty who have more of a say in decision-making and increasing career opportunities for artists at every level. Being an artist should be as much a part of Stanford culture as someone wanting to patent an app or train for a Mars mission. What will it take for that culture to change? I don’t have a clear answer but I’m guessing it would take on a combination of improving the current internal system, while also having stronger recruitment for future artists at Stanford in the years ahead. “I don’t think the arts are ever going to go away,” said John Chowning DMA ’66, founding director of the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA . Chowning’s work at Stanford in frequency modulation synthesis was the basis for the creation of so many of the synthesizers that we hear today in almost every song on the radio. “The artistic impulse gets channeled, wherever you are at Stanford.” Not only are the arts not going away, I believe Stanford has a responsibility to be a beacon on this front. At a time when other universitiesare strugglingto keep their humanities departments, Stanford’s commitment to the arts has the potential to pave the way for thousands of institutions across the country to follow suit — and IknowStanford has the money to do it. A year in, I’m finding my way. I’m immersed in the arts dorm community through ITALIC. My peer group consists of the Stanford Improvisors, and musicians from jazz bands, pop bands and even a klezmer band. I’m able to think about music even in my linguistics and religious studies classes. And none of it feels fuzzy to me. I’m designing my way forward, and I guess that’s what it means to be an artist. Stanford may have some room for me after all. Sebastian Hochman is a staff writer at The Stanford Daily for Arts & Life and University desks. He is a music major. Maybe.

All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. The initiative to reject Rice University’s Israel at 75 conference is rooted in hatred and performative anger. The Israeli occupation of Palestine is an issue that has plagued many for decades — people have lost their homes, friends, families and lives. This issue is nuanced and convoluted beyond most Rice students’ comprehension, including our own. The Baker Institute is not attempting to diminish these issues or glorify Israel’s actions over the past 75 years. By hosting this conference, it is simply acknowledging that this conflict continues to be one of the defining dilemmas of our time and one that deserves attention, especially at a center of education such as Rice University. By encouraging the average student at Rice who lacks deep understanding regarding the occupation to protest and boycott the conference, we are discouraging people from listening to those who are personally involved in the issue, perpetuating both hatred and the conflict itself. Why not encourage people to attend, and come with questions and criticisms? The speakers are coming from a plethora of backgrounds related to the conflict, and it is in all of our interests to listen, regardless of whether we agree with what they have to say. Among the panelists are Israeli leaders who offered unprecedented concessions of peace, current U.S. ambassadors to numerous Middle Eastern countries, esteemed Ivy League professors, and the former prime minister of the Palestinian Authority. If this group of people isn’t allowed to have productive discourse, what group is? And who are we to deny them this platform? The urge to shut down any conversation related to this painful topic is understandable, but the opportunity to foster exciting new dialogue among this diverse group of leaders, while providing us mostly uninformed Rice students the rare chance to educate ourselves on a complex global issue from the people attempting to solve the issue firsthand, is a unique occasion that everyone involved should recognize, not shut down. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25.

state_press_2023_20,"This year sUndergraduate Student Governmentelection turnout was low. According to data from the Fall 2022 semester, the Tempe campus boasts a population of 57,588 students. In the Tempe executive ticket election 5,050 students voted. According to Izaac Mansfield, a former USG senator and junior studying computer information systems and innovation in society, this kind of turnout is normal. This shouldn t be the norm and this can change with an increased focus on physical engagement like in USG elections of the past. People were posting things in physical areas trying to establish a presence on campus, Mansfield said. People were campaigning near the MU, down by Barrett, up by Tooker, and really kind of leveraged the full ability of the campaigning process. Along with the increased focus on physical campaigns came increased public engagement among candidates. For executive tickets, in-persondebatesused to be held during campaign season to allow candidates to establish their platforms and critique their opponents. Particularly for the presidential candidates the debate was a big thing, Mansfield said. From what I remember of the elections code … if you were on the executive ticket and not coming to the executive ticket debate that was a big deal, that was grounds for potential disqualification. Unfortunately, as a side effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, these debates and the requirements surrounding them were gradually reduced as election efforts movedonline. We eased up requirements because some people forgot about it. We re all students, we re all busy. Some people requested it, (saying Hey, this is unfair, I don t live on campus, Mansfield said. That largely came about after COVID and we eased up restrictions in the code to allow for stuff like that. Additionally, the pandemic created a different approach to campaigning. According to Mansfield, many candidates and USG took advantage of social media in their campaigns to spread the news of the election, instead of a more traditional, in-person approach. Post-pandemic, USG has largely continued its focus on online engagement. For example, during the recent elections, an email was sent out to students that had reminders about voting and a link to where students could vote onSun Devil Sync. While this is great, the drawbacks are inherent. To receive this news, in most cases, you have to follow specific social media accounts and watch for emails regarding the election. Otherwise, you ll be left behind with lackluster information coming from physical sources around campus. For example, if you were a freshman on the Downtown Phoenix campus, like me, those efforts – physically speaking – were a poster outside of the elevators at Gordon Commons (formerly Taylor Place , which included a date for the polls and a link to Sun Devil Sync. This – at least if you were a Downtown Phoenix campus student – was USG s attempt at providing physical, easy-to-access information on the election and its candidates. Neither of which informed me of candidates in the running or their platforms. However, some USG candidates have begun to place a returned emphasis on in-person campaigning. Candidates such as Patrick Apap, a junior studying public service and public policy who ran on the USG Downtown executive ticket as vice president of services, held tablings on campus. READ MORE:Meet the USG Downtown Phoenix campus executive officers for 2023-2024 I know that in the future, marketing should be definitely worked upon, Apap said. In a general sense, and also for the campaign. For myself, we had some flyers out, we passed out a lot of promotional material, and we had two tablings. I believe USG as a whole should follow suit and increase its physical presence post-pandemic. Doing so would not hurt online student engagement, but if executed properly, could actually bolster it. Imagine, for example, bringing back those mandatory executive ticket debates. These debates could be held in public, central areas of the four main campuses, drawing student attention to them while helping to put a name to a face running for a position. These debates could be shared on Zoom or a similar platform, allowing online students to participate and learn just as much as an on-campus student. Instead of needing to follow various social media accounts, one could just click a link or walk somewhere on campus and be informed and more engaged, simple as that.

crimson_2023_148,"In Disney’s Encanto, each member of the Madrigal family has one gift they’re supposed to use to help the family. These gifts range from weather control, to super strength, to the ability to heal anyone with a delicious arepa. Their town depends on these gifts, so the family is left heartbroken when the movie’s protagonist Mirabel turns out giftless. However, over the course of the film, as the Madrigal family loses their gifts, it is Mirabel who mends her family’s foundational cracks. Encanto brings beautifully nuanced and genuine Latine representation to the big screen, with a full representation highlighting both its elegance and shortcomings. Mirabel could not have succeeded without her uncle Bruno — who helped her despite all that the family did to him. One of the film’s most famous songs, “We Don’t Talk About Bruno,” introduces Mirabel’s estranged uncle through the judgmental eyes of family members, who justify his ostracization because his gift of prophecy often told them truths they did not want to hear. Abuela, the family’s matriarch, harnessed her children’s and grandchildren’s gifts to uphold the purity and reputation of the family — an aim she could never achieve with Bruno’s gift. So he was shunned and estranged to save face. “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” is more than a silly song from a children’s movie. Film and music are essential media for spearheading discourse around social change, especially in places like Puerto Rico, where music is a critical part of cultural expression. “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” asks listeners to think about the Brunos in their own lives. This is especially important since stories like Bruno’s are more common than you might think in Latine communities — including, as I recently learned, in my own family. Sitting in a church pew for her grandfather’s funeral, my Mama remembers seeing a six-foot-tall woman walking in with beautiful long black pelo lacio, or straight hair. The whispers began, her presence triggering an eruption of hushed unease across the room. Mama and her sisters’ curiosity was quickly suppressed by their aunts, who instructed them to “ignore” and “not talk to him,” and to “focus on the service.” Him? Puzzled, Mama watched on. The woman was ushered out and returned to the service dressed in a guayabera, a traditional formal men’s shirt. The last time Mama saw this woman was shortly after the funeral, stealing glances into a hallway where my Abuela was secretly coaching her to walk “less feminine.” Channels of chisme, or gossip, later revealed that she was a cousin Mama did not know she had, because the woman’s mother did not accept her as her child — let alone as her daughter. She was a transgender woman, a strong soul sent away to experience the world separately, because her family preferred theirs without her insofar as she was a “her.” She had been living in New York City, for her safety and autonomy, and had returned only for the funeral. However, she stayed longer than intended, with the home her parents had offered for her stay turning out to be a setup for conversion therapy — a final effort before severing ties. These were the conditions of her family’s love. Having previously thought there were no other queer people within my family, this story shook me. I yearned to discover what happened to her, though all that remains is the presumably biased history circulated throughout the family. How many others’ names must we bury? How many other names have we buried that I will never hear? Queerness is still shrouded by a shadow of controversy, especially in Latine communities, only acceptable “as long as it’s not my kid.” But accepting queerness from afar is not the same as accepting queerness. My lingering fear of becoming the next Bruno puts my identity and culture at crossroads, a sentiment shared by many of the queer people of color I have met at Harvard. Even if we are accepted among our peers, being out at home is often much more difficult: We must grapple with the desire to make our families look good, even at the expense of hiding who we are. We share the anxiety of being asked who we’re dating at a family gathering and trying not to give an answer that will get our family uninvited from the next one. We know the discomfort of performing straightness, dressing so that our families are not held responsible for our self-expression. Don’t get me wrong: There are countless beautiful pockets for queer people to flourish andfind familyoutside of blood relations. I’ve found comfort leaning into my own queerness throughout my time at Harvard, especially after meeting a mix of those happily out, with and without supportive families. But within my family and others, the fear of becoming the next Bruno will never disappear until we begin having more open conversations about the ones we’ve already sent away. It’s about time we talked about Bruno. Maia Patel Masini ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Kirkland House.

stanforddaily_2023_94,"Dear Editor, As leaders within the FSL (Fraternity and Sorority Life community we felt it important to respond to the opinion piece authored by theDaily’s Editorial Board. To begin with, we largely agree. The social opportunities including parties, philanthropic events, and non-alcoholic events hosted by FSL organizations should only be a small part of the choices available to Stanford students. We concur that hosting any event is currently far too difficult, and we look forward to the changes promised by the administration to streamline the process. We would also like to state unequivocally that the primary reason many of our events are not as inclusive as we would like is directly driven by the actions and policies of the University, not our desire to exclude our fellow students. The Greek system has played an outsized role in our conversations about the challenges of social life on Stanford campus. Being sometimes over-represented as a hero, and often unfairly portrayed as the villain. It is to this last point that we would like to correct some of the misrepresentations frequently made and echoed by the Editorial Board. The first is diversity and exclusion. Our FSL community is observationally among the most diverse in the nation. We have been working with the administration to try and obtain data that we can publish to inform the community and potential new members. Every chapter is not perfect, but all want to improve. In support of economic diversity, Stanford has the Opportunity Fund that allocates 16% of its resources to FLI students who recognize the FSL community as an elevating platform for them, but while this resource is greatly appreciated it is dwarfed by the need of the many FSL members who do not fit the wealthy stereotypes. To include these students many of our chapters have created alumni led funds to support the experience. This coupled with dues well below the national average place Stanford’s FSL community amongst the nation’s most accessible. It is true we have a selective process for choosing new members. No one enjoys selective processes whether it is choosing a University, joining a sports team, matching to a medical residency, or finding a job. It is both about resources and assuring the quality of an experience. There is currently a larger disconnect between the student demand for a housed FSL experience and the ability to provide that experience than has ever existed. Our housed organizations are larger than they have ever been in Stanford’s history. For many of them there are more members living outside of the house than in it. For the second year in a row despite taking record sized classes of new members, there were almost as many people that we could not take into the system as joined. This again is a matter of resources and policy that we do not control. We will continue to advocate for more chapters and more housing to expand the experience to the growing number of students who desire it. In response to the concerns about safety, we would like to state unequivocally that the Stanford community should strive to create an environment where non-consensual contact never occurs, and the FSL community knows we can be part of the solution. We’ve built in training for our members, monitors at our parties, reporting hotlines, and codes of conduct for members and guests. With that said, we feel the Editorial Board misrepresentedthe datain their piece. In the linked reference we could not even find numbers to support the 47% figure given in the initial piece, which has since been corrected after our piece was submitted for publication. Most people only read the original article and never see the corrections, which are typically not issued for pieces regarding Greek Life. This feeds a vicious narrative in the Stanford community. In actuality, we found that for the incidents cited, the most egregious assaults were over 5 times as likely to happen in a dorm and non-consensual touching was over 20% more likely to happen in a dorm. Lastly, we write to express our desire to be included in future conversations surrounding community improvement. The Editorial Board did not contact FSL leaders to request comment before authoring their piece and consequently misrepresented our community in damaging ways. We will never profess that we are perfect, but it is hard for us to correctly assess our shortcomings without the opportunity to be included in the important discussions about them. We embrace the recommendations on how FSL chapters can promote more safety and diversity. We commit to enacting the recommendations of the Editorial Board. But we would respectfully ask that our community, who represent more than 1 out of every 5 undergraduates, not be blamed for all challenging issues our community faces. Stanford social life thrives when it is student led and provides opportunities as diverse as the students. We can and should partner to make our student experience better. Sincerely, Jude Reiferson ’24 (Interfraternity Council (IFC President and Olivia Partamian ’24 (Inter-Sorority Council (ISC President on behalf of the joint IFC and ISC councils The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.

rice_thresher_2023_54,"ByThresher Editorial Board3/7/23 9:45pm The Rice Women’s Resource Center is now officially ablanket tax organization, joining the ranks of the Thresher, Rice Program Council and University Court, among others. RWRC will now receive funds from the $85 “blanket tax” that each student pays with their tuition. With their new designation, RWRC needs to expand the resources they offer to meaningfully reach every student they’re meant to serve. RWRC faced its fair share of criticism during its application to the blanket tax committee. Anonymous testimony from a RWRC member highlighted disorganization in the organization, such as a lack of changeover documents. More concerningly, the testimony claimed that RWRC spent a significant amount of their budget on merchandise while menstrual products and supplies ran low. Now, as a blanket tax organization, RWRC will certainly have the resources to create a real impact for Rice women. RWRC prides itself on building a more supportive and dynamic atmosphere on campus for women. However, many women on campus have likely had limited interactions and access to such efforts. While many of the RWRC’s typical events are worthwhile, such as their self defense classes, these events need to be better advertised to the entire Rice community so that more women are able to benefit from them. RWRC has taken steps in the right direction, namely offering free Plan B. In the coming years, the organization should continue down this path and use its new funding stream to prioritize regularly stocking physical resources such as menstrual products, condoms and medication such as midol and ibuprofen. With more power comes more responsibility, and we are confident that RWRC will take its new status seriously. RWRC should spend the next few months building a strong internal structure that allows for accountability and transparency. The organization should also get its budget in line and clearly state its priorities for the next year, and we hope to see a plan to increase awareness of the RWRC’s services and events. Expanding RWRC’s impact on campus can truly help women — if RWRC does it in the right way.

crimson_2023_20,"To kill a child is a terrible, unjustifiable thing. To kill many, for enough years that their younger siblings and their children, too, will grow in the shadow of that fear, is an unforgivable sin. Roughly half of Gaza’s residents are under 18 years old; so too are a number of the Israeli hostages and casualties from last week’s escalation. That, legally speaking, makes them children. The Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee — in whose name I don’t write this op-ed — has condemned the ongoing onslaught of violence against civilians, young and old, Palestinian and Israeli alike. They have condemned, too, the thousands of innocent deaths that prefaced the current tragedy. The spilling of innocent blood is never a welcome sight; it seeps into the ground, crimson stained, and taints those standing on it with resentment and loathing, with despair and anger too heavy to carry. That is and has been the story of the region since the dawn of the colonial project; that is and has been the story of Gaza’s besieged residents for years. Opposing violence against civilians is and must remain a core and unalienable part of the PSC’s mission. Avoiding further loss of life and achieving a political resolution that guarantees basic rights for the millions denied them must be the motivating force behind the struggle for Palestinian freedom. Opposing violence, however, must go beyond regretting its specific manifestations, beyond the loathing of individual bullets, no matter how loathsome they may be. Condemning an attack without addressing, or even trying to understand, the factors that triggered it only lets the stain grow; it is no better than responding to violence with thoughts and prayers while refusing meaningful reform. It’s an exercise in virtue signaling, a social media-attuned flattening of a hideous reality — one unlikely to save the next generation of innocents. For any cycle of violence to end, its root causes must be ascertained and addressed. Those structural factors are the same today that they were before the attack — the same they have been for decades of internationally recognized illegal settlement-building and occupation by Israel, the same that have led international and Israeli human rights organizations alike to characterize the current legal regime as one of dispossession and apartheid, the same that preside over forced evictions of Palestinians to make way for Jewish settlers, the same that produce a steady stream of dead Palestinian civilians and children without sparking any meaningful outrage. Israel treats Palestinian lives as disposable; Palestinians, denied their right to return to their homes (and, in Gaza, largely denied even the right to exit their narrow, resource-starved strip have suffered that truth in their own land for far too long. There are no explicitly labeled terrorist attacks against Palestinians — because an onslaught of constant, state-sponsored, unbridled terror is their daily reality, one common enough to fail to elicit headlines. But you don’t need headlines to feel pain. Grief can be a lonely endeavor. Children can, and do, die without anyone looking. Gaza was broadly acknowledged to be the world’s largest open-air prison well before the attacks, subject to an aggressive blockade for 16 years that prevented most of its inhabitants from leaving the strip. Israel’s increasingly far-right government had escalated attacks on Palestinians within and beyond its borders, storming the holy Al Aqsa Mosque, accelerating the annexation of territories and settlement construction, and dehumanizing Palestinians while seeking to deny them statehood. A people was refused their own land, their own nation, within a polity that seeks to govern them only as a disempowered, defeated minority. The toll from the incoming escalation will almost certainly be more unforgiving on Palestinian lives, following the depressing path of the last seven decades. Collective punishment, a war crime in its own right, now seems virtually unavoidable. Israel’s president has already deemed an “entire nation,” even civilians, “responsible” for the bloodshed; the country s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, has enacted a “complete siege” of Gaza to ensure,in his own words, that “no electricity, no food, no fuel” can reach a region home to roughly 2 million Palestinians. Gallant has also, ambiguously and revealingly, declared the nation’s enemy “human animals” who will be dealt with “accordingly.” “Accordingly,” in this context, can only mean slaughter, an accelerated path to genocide. And children are rarely excused from genocide. It is thus precisely because we all abhor violence against civilians — precisely because we want to escape the cruel cycle of bullets and barbed wire — that we all must acknowledge the factors that triggered Hamas’s attacks. We all must bring the root causes to the forefront of any conversation. Failing to do so would entail abdicating any possibility of resolving the current conflict — looking the other way, and foolishly praying for better decades. To quote Israel’s paper of record, hardly a stranger to the depths of Jewish grief: The bloodshed is “the clear responsibility of one person: Benjamin Netanyahu,” who has created “a government of annexation and dispossession” and embraced “a foreign policy that openly ignored the existence and rights of Palestinians.” I agree. To kill a child is a terrible, unjustifiable thing. But to allow the cruel cycle to continue, to sustain the institutions that enable the continuous oppression of Palestinians and feed unending violence — that, too, is an unforgivable sin.

stanforddaily_2023_57,"I am cautiously looking forward to the formation of the search committee tasked tofindthe University’s next Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education (VPUE . The committee, asannouncedby the Stanford Report on Oct. 20, is going to be “formed as soon as possible.” Thinking of an administrative position that has more of a direct impact on undergraduates’ classroom experiences is difficult, to put it lightly. I would be surprised if there were any undergraduates that have not interacted with just some of the numerous offices and programs underVPUE: such as Academic Advising, Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR , Structured Liberal Education (SLE , Bing Overseas Study Program (BOSP , Frosh 101, Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing (WAYS and Civic, Liberal, and Global Education (COLLEGE . Throw a figurative stone at any undergraduate-related office and you’ll likely hit one overseen, at least in part, by VPUE. The immense power that VPUE wields over undergraduates should serve as a loud wakeup call for those tasked with forming the VPUE search committee and, naturally, the people who will serve as its members. With three top University officialsresigningover the past year, there is a clear opportunity to deeply re-examine the direction that Stanford is taking in its educational mission. Coupling that with the impacts thejoiningof the Atlantic Coast Conference will have on student athletes, as well as ongoing faculty discussions on how to bestsupportundergrads more broadly, it is clear that undergrads deserve a real say in an office overseeing so much of their education. To that end, a few stakeholder groups come to mind for me. The very legitimacy of the VPUE search committee, and therefore whoever it ends up choosing, depends on whether voices of the following groups (and much, much more are heard in the search process: namely, first generation and/or low-income (FLI students, international students, student athletes, religious students, frosh and students with disabilities. We should also expect the VPUE search committee to sufficiently consider the voices of students from a variety of majors and schools. Ideally, every student stakeholder group would be empowered to send an undergraduate representative to serve as a committee voting member. I am more than willing to acknowledge, however, that this is unrealistic. After all, thepresidentandprovostsearch committees have had 20 and 12 members, respectively. Considering the need for faculty representation, voting representation cannot be guaranteed to every relevant group of student stakeholders. I believe it is more than fair to expect the VPUE search committee to consult undergraduate students during every step of its work, beginning with its formation. I believe a fair first step would be to ensure that the representation of undergrads on the search committee equals that of faculty. After all, shared governance, the recognition of students and faculty as co-equal partners in the educational experience at Stanford, is one of the University’s core beliefs. The search committee itself must reflect the communities that the next VPUE is going to work with — students and faculty alike. Diversity of life experiences, classroom experiences and fields of study are of the utmost importance. I commend the current VPUE Sarah Church for her service to the undergraduate community and Stanford as a whole. With a stellarrecordthat includes upholding equitable academic standards through the worst stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and improving academic accessibility for students from less-advantaged communities (and much more , her successor has incredibly large shoes to fill. I am calling on Provost Jenny Martinez to maintain a balance of power between students and faculty on the VPUE search committee, ensuring that both groups have an equal say in choosing the next VPUE. I am calling on her to ensure that offices including but not limited to the Office of Accessible Education, Disability Community Space, Office of Religious and Spiritual Life, Bechtel International Center, Fraternity and Sorority Life and Athletics bring student voices to the table. Furthermore, community centers like the Women’s Community Center, the Black Community Service Center, El Centro Chicano y Latino, the Asian American Activities Center, Hillel and Markaz ought not to be left out of the conversation. This kind of broad outreach is all the more urgent when Martinezspoke, rightfully, at the Faculty Senate about ensuring that Stanford remains committed to admitting students from all walks of life. Navigating the Stanford bureaucracy, for any reason, can be incredibly exhausting (something I have personally experienced . Now is the time for a major University search committee to finally start bringing concerns about navigating undergraduate education to the table. We need to welcome student voting representation with open arms in order to usher in a new, more student-friendly Stanford. Sebastian Strawser ‘26 is an Opinions contributor.

crimson_2023_164,"Harvard Business School professor Francesca Gino, a prominent academic studying honesty, hasrecently made headlinesfor allegations that she authored papers containing fraudulent data. The accusationsstem from four postswritten and published by Leif D. Nelson, Joseph P. Simmons, and Uri Simonsohn on their blog,Data Colada. The Data Colada posts present a careful and devastating indictment of Gino’s work. For instance, one postdescribes a datasetcontaining a demographic question asking students to report their class year. Instead of a typical response (e.g. “junior” or “class of 2016” , 20 respondents gave the nonsensical answer of “Harvard.” The data collected from these respondents overwhelmingly supported the study’s hypothesis, strongly suggesting that the data were tampered with. As oneHarvard professor put it, “We are never going to get stronger evidence of fraud, short of the researcher cackling maniacally as they manipulate the Excel spreadsheet on camera.” Data Colada’s report led Harvard to undertake an internal investigation into Gino’s work and ultimately place her on unpaid administrative leave. Ginoresponded by suing Harvard— as well as Nelson, Simmons, and Simonsohn — for at least $25 million, due to the impact of the allegations on her career and reputation. Gino’s lawsuit is likely to fail — similar lawsuitshave not succeeded, and manyconsider hers unconvincing— but the involved parties now face the prospect of a protracted legal battle and hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal fees. While Harvard has ample resources to defend itself, Nelson, Simmons, and Simonsohn do not; they are private citizens who are not backed by a $50.9 billion endowment. We, along with many members of the academic community, are deeply concerned that this lawsuit will deter future efforts to uncover fraudulent research. A GoFundMe aiming to finance Data Colada’s legal defense has raised more than $357,000 from thousands of people as of this writing, including multiple Harvard professors, but we believe that Harvard should cover these costs. Simine Vazire, one of the GoFundMe’s organizers, agrees, recently tellingThe Crimsonthat a goal of the GoFundMe is to “put some pressure on Harvard and on the three data quality researchers’ universities to step up and support.” The allegations against Gino occur amidst broader challenges related to ensuring the reliability of research. Influential social science experiments have been recreated butfailed to yieldthe original results. In the biomedical sciences, nearly 2 percent of papers include figures with images thatappear to be deliberately manipulated, while a similar percentage of scientistsadmit to having engaged in fraud. The combined effect of un-replicable study results and fraud significantly undermines the credibility of academic research. Blogs like Data Colada represent an important and all too rare check on suspect research, but there is little professional incentive to do this kind of work. The threat of lawsuits likely makes others even less willing to report suspected research misconduct. Universities that employ academics accused of fraud should therefore pay whistleblowers’ legal fees for three reasons: They benefit from outsiders exposing their employees’ misconduct, they are responsible for their researchers’ behavior, and they should ensure others can afford to speak up by subsidizing this kind of public good. First, universities have a stake in uncovering their professors’ research misconduct. Harvard’s reputation is tied to the quality of its research. In addition, fraud can expose universities to financial risk: Duke University recentlypaid the US government $112.5 millionafter a whistleblower alleged that falsified research had been used to attain federal grant funding. While it is difficult to quantify the financial value of Data Colada’s report, Harvard should at least ensure Data Colada does not pay to perform this valuable service. Second, Harvard is responsible for the conduct of its researchers. As such, it should ensure that people who catch its employees doing their jobs poorly – and perform an important public service in the process – are not financially penalized as a result. Notably, this is also an argument that Harvard should cover Data Colada’s legal expenses rather than Nelson’s, Simmons’s, and Simonsohn’s own institutions. Finally, the work done by blogs like Data Colada has always been important, but not lucrative; now, it may become extremely costly. Covering whistleblowers’ legal fees would set an important precedent. While the Data Colada GoFundMe campaign has exceeded its fundraising goal, crowdsourcing legal fees is not a sustainable long-term solution, nor is it one that is likely to reassure other academics considering making similar allegations. (It does, however, show how much the public values Data Colada’s work. Harvard has the opportunity to set an important precedent, fulfill its obligations to Data Colada, and perform a valuable public service by covering Data Colada’s legal fees. It should seize this opportunity before academia as a whole pays the price. Leah L. Pierson is a sixth-year M.D.-Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard T.H.

crimson_2023_98,"After each meeting of my African politics class last semester, my mind buzzed with new revelations. It felt like I had unlocked a field of study previously unknown to me. Having spent my short academic career essentially thinking ‘international relations’ was a shorthand for the caprices of permanent United Nations Security Council members, the opportunity to learn about complex political interactions on the African continent assumed a new magnetism. What I didn’t realize was that this feeling manifested perhaps the greatest curricular blind spot in Harvard’s Department of Government. As far as I could find, Harvard offers only one class centered squarely on African politics: Gov 94GD: “Africa: Power and Politics.” The class, an option within the department’s Gov 94 seminar program, fielded just 10 students last semester, including myself. What’s more, its instructor — Christopher E. Rhodes ’04 — isn’t even a full-fledged Harvard faculty member but a visiting lecturer from across the Charles River at Boston University. The course’s continent-wide scope means that graduating students might not be able to call themselves experts on African affairs, but they could probably hold their own in a 30-second conversation on the Lord’s Resistance Army, a step or three beyond most Americans. And most crucially, the class casts light upon a region of the world that traditional international relations inquiry far too often leaves in the dark. Harvard’s undergraduate programming focused on African government should not consist entirely of an afternoon chat between 10 students. The department should, at minimum, provide an unlimited enrollment, lecture-based survey course to the effect of Steven R. Levitsky’s class on Latin American comparative politics, lest budding Harvard scholars of government graduate without any knowledge of a region that grows more crucial to the global order each day. This 2022-23 academic year, a course directory search for “Africa politics” yields disappointing results. Of just 12 independent Faculty of Arts and Sciences results, two are literature surveys, three are more focused on colonialism and postcolonial development, two concern only North Africa and the Middle East, and one is John L. Comaroff’s anthropology of law course. Other than Gov 94GD, the closest thing to a region-wide government class is Hist 1901: “Nationalism, Political Independence, and Economic Development in Africa,” which markets itself more as a journey in historical and structural analysis than a modern-day assessment of political actors and forces. There seems to exist no class on contemporary African politics beyond my little seminar. This dearth of knowledge couldn’t persist at a more inopportune geopolitical moment, as formerly weak African nations have begun to play far greater roles in both the global economy and international politics at large. The legacy of colonialism in African state-building allowed extractive institutions — mechanisms thatsocial scientists defineas being “designed to extract incomes and wealth from one subset of society to benefit a different subset” — to persist long after independence. An example would be the exploitative Kimberley diamond mines in the British Cape Colony, from which colonial profits flowed to a small circle of private magnates and postcolonial profits flowed to the colossal diamond-trade superpower De Beers Group, whose Consolidated Mines subsidiary owned the Kimberley mines until 2016. Now, however, African leaders are replacing these institutions with more sustainable investment partnerships. As oneaccounting firm noted, extractive industries in Africa accounted for over half of investment every year save one between 2005 and 2011, but made up a minority of investment in every year save one between 2012 and 2018. If the promise of greater participation in global markets isn’t enough, consider foreign policy: Africa has quickly become ground zero for a proxy war of influence between China and the United States. Over the last 20-plus years, China has taken on a rapacious series ofdevelopment initiativesin Africa, formalized in 2013 as the Belt and Road Initiative. In August 2022,the Biden-Harris administration calledChina’s initiatives a strategy to “challenge the rules-based international order, advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests, undermine transparency and openness, and weaken U.S. relations with African peoples and governments.” Clearly, an in-class exploration of these trends through an African political lens justifies whatever low cost to Harvard it would exact. A broad African politics class could have value that extends beyond the salience of its material, however. To pass on making available a broad and pluralistic image of African politics to Harvard students creates dangerous room for the“single story”of African homogeneity to take hold; students will not necessarily know that African governance ranges from a robust parliamentary republic in Botswana to an authoritarian regime headed by the world’slongest ruling dictatorin Equatorial Guinea. Instead, the archetypal, all-too-common perception that sub-Saharan Africa is some amalgamation of identical, weak feudal states will find new hosts to infect. Granted, it might be unfair to place all of the blame on Harvard’s course design. The total class size of 10 in Gov 94GD does not imply any kind of overwhelming demand for knowledge of African government. More troubling still was the class makeup, as most of its students introduced themselves as hailing from some African nation — suggesting students without a personal connection to Africa were less likely to pursue studies thereof. Still, there is no reason to believe a well-taught, gripping class on African political affairs could not build momentum among curious students and attract a healthy enrollment. Harvard saysit endeavors to educate leaders of the future. Today’s interconnected world demands that an adept leader bear a nuanced understanding of all places and peoples. In seeking to convey this understanding, Harvard must begin with the most obvious unit of measurement: the classes we take. Peter N.

crimson_2023_77,"I’ve never celebrated Valentine s Day with a valentine. For me, this holiday has never consisted of a date, or a box of chocolates, or a kiss, or someone to hold or be held by. It’s been a rather hollow holiday for my whole life, but I love it nonetheless because I love love. I think we all ought to celebrate love, even if we don’t currently have the type of love Valentine’s Day is typically understood to celebrate. But there are other reasons to celebrate this day, too. Valentine’s Day shares a date with another important holiday: the birthday of preeminent abolitionist and statesman Fredrick Douglass. Born into enslavement, Douglass earned his spot as one of the most influential and celebrated Americans to ever live. His birthday represents far more than an ordinary birthday. Douglass, like many enslaved people, had his birthday taken away from him. He never knew the true date — only that it was likely sometime in February. Because his mother called him her “Little Valentine,” he chose February 14th to celebrate his birthday, reasserting his personhood and defying the dehumanization of his enslavement. For centuries, Black holidays and celebrations have been forged and fought for — history has shown that they aren’t just a given. As we look beyond Valentine’s Day, we should view the entirety of Black History Month in this light. This month-long celebration is a way to honor the previously forgotten, unmarked, and unmemorialized love Black Americans have poured into this country and our own liberation in the face of a past and present of racist violence and dehumanization. Black History Month provides us a framework for marking those unremembered contributions. I’ve heard a few times that Black History Month relegates the history of Black Americans to a limited timeframe (the shortest month of the year, at that , but the dates bookending a celebration don’t have to limit its acknowledgement or belittle its importance. Regardless, it remains incredibly important to have a regular, structured time to celebrate all of the contributions Black Americans have made to this country, particularly those we don’t have dates for. We should imagine this month not as an all-encompassing celebration of the history we do know, but rather as an opportunity to commemorate the stories that have gone unarchived and forgotten. The lost archive of Black history doesn’t just include the names on slave ledgers, or the physical demarcations of sexual violence in my genome, or the hope in a simple hymn. Much about the lives of my ancestors will never be accessible to me; it has been taken from me. So this month is about another project, too, that Douglass was instrumental in launching. He initiated a process of self-memorialization in a world that didn’t want him to be actualized in the first place. He was, for a long time, the most photographed American ever. Douglass filled the photobooks, the calendar, and the archives of Blackness, all of which had been hollowed out and kept empty for generations — he advanced the self-memorialization of the whole race. To thrive and survive as a Black person in a white space, we must research, acknowledge, celebrate, and share our accomplishments — the big, communal ones, but also the small, personal ones. This project necessitates the constant discovery and celebration of new holidays that catalog the work, fights, wins, and losses that don’t have dates on our calendar. That the history behind the Black American experience cannot fit neatly in February doesn’t mean that Black History Month isn’t a worthy endeavor. I do understand that holidays like these can also spur apprehension and sadness. It is painful for anyone to celebrate themselves, or their ancestors, or the love in their life, when so much history was purposefully erased. It’s like building without a foundation. Indeed, Black History Month and all the holidays it contains are bittersweet for me. But they are better celebrated now than never. Hopefully, in celebrating these holidays, we hold ourselves to building a better future, treating the people around us with respect and dignity, and loving ourselves a little more every day. For me, this means commemorating Fredrick Douglass’s Birthday, celebrating the interracial, queer love that created my family this Valentine’s Day, and always remembering how thankful I am for the Black leaders that fought for my ability to be where I am today. As for the rest of the month, let the love flow freely. Tenzin R. Gund-Morrow ‘26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Canaday Hall."

crimson_2023_133,"We can both recall the precise moment the reality of the climate crisis came crashing down on us. For Anna, it was in 2022, in Jackson, Mississippi: Last year, my hometown made national news as a water crisis kept nearly 150,000 residents, including my family, from safe drinking water. Systemic disinvestment in water infrastructure and climate change are at the heart of Jackson’s water crisis. Tucked away in my corner of campus, I prayed for my mother and father, that their bodies would not be poisoned. I wished for protection of the babies bathing in contaminated water. My heart changed as it thirsted for justice and protection of that which is sacred: water. For Maya, it was the day the sky turned red in Northern California: I stepped outside of my house and felt my breath leave my body. Even today, I find it difficult to express the disorientation of looking up at the sky and seeing a milky red haze, the color of light pouring through skin; it felt like God had closed their eyes. I can remember the despair, paired with a deep confusion. As fires ravaged my home county, I was living in a state of hyper awareness, checking the alerts on my phone to see if my family would need to evacuate. But in that moment, all I could do was stare up at the sky, mouth agape. Although we live in different states facing distinct impacts of the climate crisis, both of our homes are bound by a shared reality: this time, the crisis is profoundly urgent. While climate change has material implications, the environmental devastation also has urgent psychological, spiritual, and social implications given the toll that loss of life (human and non-human , habitat, and livelihood have on human wellbeing. Recent reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Climate Council of Australia, as well as studies published in Nature and PNAS, note that climate change is linked with 1 an increase inclimate-related anxietyandPTSD, 2 a rise in thelikelihood of armed conflict, and 3 growing suicide rates among farmers. To mitigate these potential outcomes, communities will need to deploy social and spiritual resources to attend to the emotional fallout from ecological devastation, especially for communities of color which climate change disproportionately impacts. In times of crisis, humans turn to spiritual leaders; spirituality has been integral to some of the most formative movements of the past century. Faith leaders are among the most effective people to spark action, and we see examples of ecotheological thought across nearly every major religion. As spiritual practitioners, we believe that land and spiritual wellbeing are deeply interconnected. This is not a revolutionary notion. Indigenous leaders have been raising the alarm that our spiritual and physical realities are intertwined for centuries. We must listen to and learn from them as we mobilize collective, spiritually rooted action worldwide. More recently, we have seen the potential for spiritual leaders to activate communities around critical climate action: the leaders of Standing Rock mobilizing collective action around the sacrality of water, Pope Francis’ Laudato Si’, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ donation of 5,700 water shares back to Great Salt Lake, the joint Appeal signed by almost 40 faith leaders ahead of COP26 in 2021. Chaplains and spiritual practitioners, including ourselves and our classmates at the Harvard Divinity School (where we’ll be gathering April 10-14 for Climate Justice Week , are offering spiritual care to people in the wake of climate disasters and in the face of climate anxiety. Climate action is often discussed through a lens of policy, science, and infrastructure, especially here at Harvard. These interventions are, of course, essential, yet climate change asks more of us. Acknowledging our impact on the earth demands that we contend with bigger questions like: What is the role of people on this earth? How do we care for each other during increasingly challenging times? How do we live well, live sustainably, treat the land and its species as sacred? How do we find strength and courage to walk forward with an open heart in the face of devastation? These are the questions we ask as we look at red skies and wonder if our loved ones have clean water to drink. The grief, disorientation, and despair of these moments will find healing in community and spiritual care. If we spend more time responding to these questions, just maybe our planet will heal too. As we look to the next decade — which will determine just how much temperature change our world will experience — we cannot afford to disregard the existential nature of what we are facing. Our earth will be forever changed. We are being asked to love a world of increasing chaos and difficulty. We must turn to one another, look at the fires and poisoned water, and ask ourselves what more we can do. Our future is at stake. CORRECTION: April 7, 2023 A previous version of this story misstated the name of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the Church of Latter Day Saints.

wildcat_arizona_2023_15,"Candles laid out for people to grab before the candlelight vigil honoring the life of Thomas Meixner on Oct. 7. The vigil took place at Old Main on the University of Arizona Campus. Each year, National Gun Violence Survivors Week is recognized from Feb. 1-7 to honor those who have survived gun violence. For people who have lived through such horrors, oftentimes surviving is just half the battle. To survive is to create an invisible weight that presses against their shoulders; one of trauma, guilt and immense loss. At the University of Arizona, we carry this heaviness more than we would like. Where do we put it? According to UA sociology professor and gun culture expertJennifer Carlson, it’s probably best not to store it on the top shelf. “For those who survive it, gun violence is not a demarcated event with a clear ‘ending’; while the immediate physical danger may pass, gun violence leaves scars — physical, psychic, social — that impact people’s basic feelings of safety and security and can undermine, in the case of a campus, students’ ability to be focused learners and engaged members of the student body,” Carlson said. “This is why it makes sense not just to talk about ‘gun violence’ but also ‘gun trauma,’ and to recognize that people need different kinds of support in the aftermath of gun violence.” During a week to honor gun violence survivors, Carlson’s words couldn’t be any more relevant. It has been almost four months since the death of UA professor Thomas Meixner and a little over five months since the shooting at Yugo, astudent apartment. These marks of violence within our community remain the most potent in our mind and still many of us anxiously await the “when” of the next tragedy — not the “if.” Herein lies the invisible scar gun violence marks, one we as a campus community have not yet healed from. I got the chance to speak with Patrick Robles, theAssociated Students of the UA student body president. When Meixner was killed in October, Robles was on campus at the Student Union Memorial Center, just a few buildings away from the shooting. “I ran into the hall, grabbed as many students as we could, brought them inside and locked the doors. I used the mass shooting training I learned in high school,” Robles said. In the week following, class resumed on our campus as normal. Memorials were created and then taken down. Less than a month earlier, the Yugo shooting occurred. Students walked past broken glass and blood stains for days. Somehow, we shrug this kind of trauma off. “It could have been us,” we say. We usually follow it by talking about how lucky we feel that it wasn’t. Perhaps within these kinds of statements, we hope that an invisible bandaid will be placed on the tragedy we have experienced. Of course, we know that’s impossible. Students and faculty should use this week, Feb. 1-7, to acknowledge what we have survived. When gun violence is something we have come to anticipate, we all become survivors in some sense or the other. “Yes, there are people who were directly affected. But then, let’s talk about the community-wide impact,” Robles said. “I know students who still feel concerned walking on campus. I know students whose anxiety is triggered. With that, students want to see some systematic change happen.” While the systematic change that Robles mentioned may seem out of reach, it seems the best place to start is small. As students, there has never been a better time to start asking questions. How do we dissect an issue that runs so deep within our country’s culture? How can we compact it to a campus size? How do we take care of ourselves and our peers in the process? While change in the system is the obvious goal, it’s also the hardest and most complex to achieve. Gun violence, of course, is not unique to the UA campus. According to an October 2022 Arizona Public Media article, 80% of homicides from 2018-21 in the Tucson Police Department’s jurisdiction had to do withgun violence. To delve into the issue of gun law reform, especially in the state of Arizona, would perhaps be an entirely different story in itself and a longer one at that. The point of National Gun Violence Survivors Week isn’t to brainstorm some lightbulb moment where we come up with the grand solution to the worsening problem. Perhaps it is instead a time for us all to reflect, to remember what we have lost. “Gun violence survivors week represents a moment to pause, at least with regard to gun violence,” Carlson said. “It is a moment to recognize that gun violence is not something that simply happens ‘out there’ or ‘somewhere else’ but touches our lives. Gun violence survivors week provides a space to reckon with what this means — as individuals, as members of a community, and as a society where gun violence happens often enough that it is often treated as unremarkable.” Countless members of the UA community know the horror of gun violence as they do their neighbors or the back of their hand. National Gun Violence Survivors Week is a time to acknowledge the brutality we have witnessed while simultaneously not allowing it to define us. “Some students may throw themselves into their studies; other students may need time away from campus. And still others may not consider themselves impacted at all — until they realize that they are,” Carlson said. Follow Olivia Krupp onTwitter Olivia is a sophomore studying journalism.

ubyssey_2023_1,"Dec. 4, 2023 Written byJessica HanserandRichard Menkis Drs. Jessica Hanser and Richard Menkis areassociate professors of history in the Department of History. Editor’s Note: This opinion letter is a response toDecolonize Palestine at UBC,” an opinion published on November 1written by Dr. Hicham Safieddine. The suffering from the Israel-Hamas war is heartbreaking. As academics — and as fair-minded individuals — we must explain these events without taking broad swings at a perceived ‘enemy.’ Using inflammatory language and distorting events not only does an injustice to the complexity of the issue but can harm and intimidate the members of our community. We have been disappointed to see this kind of discourse echoed on the UBC campus, including a November 1Ubysseyop-edwritten by our colleague Dr. Hicham Safieddine. In their mission to restore a voice to the Palestinian people, we urge our colleagues to approach these events in an even-handed manner and confront antisemitism in the rhetoric and fundamental mission of Hamas and its supporters. We agree, without reservation, that opponents of Israel’s policies should not be intimidated or silenced. We also recognize that extreme representations of Israel, as well as the refusal to confront the violence of October 7, have silenced members of our UBC community. We must ensure the Palestinian people’s voices are heard. We must also prevent discussions and protests from stoking and spreading antisemitism, with dangerous reverberations on campus and beyond. When we decry the suffering of the Palestinian people from Israeli bombing, we cannot refer to the massacre of Israeli women, children and men merely as the “Hamas operation on October 7.” When we point to “fascist governments in Europe” voting against a recent ceasefire at the United Nations, we must not ignore the brutality of some of the regimes (including Russia and Iran whovotedin its favour. This rhetoric, found in the November 1 op-ed we reply to, does not reach across the aisle, nor does it foster inclusive discussion of a complex matter. We must also acknowledge and challenge the dangerous rhetoric employed by extremist leadership of both Israelis and Palestinians. For example, when the original article highlights the “vile and hateful speech by Israeli government officials and their Canadian allies,” it is imperative to also point out that the very origins of Hamas are entangled in the most dangerous forms of antisemitism.The Hamas Covenant of 1988drew justification for its acts from the worst antisemitic conspiracy theories, including the notoriousProtocols of the Elders of Zion.In 2017, Hamasdropped the most extremeconspiratorial language, while still blaming Jews (this time Zionists for antisemitism. It is only an antisemitic outlook that readily explains the mindset of someone who, on October 7, can call his family in Gaza, with frenzied pride about killing ten Jews. Again, let us be clear. We are not speaking about the Palestinian people or the people of Gaza. We are talking about Hamas in its ideology and behaviour. Finally, we must not ignore the fact that when Hamas called for worldwide support, some answered that call by celebrating the violence of October 7 and behaving according to the organization’s hateful example. In the past weeks, in Canada, we have seen synagogues and Jewish schools under attack, not with words but withbulletsandfirebombs. For the first time in their lives, Jewish students on campus areafraid to wear their kippahs. External cultural symbols — whether a hijab, keffiyeh, kippah or Star of David — should not make people targets under any circumstances. But in the present situation, it is also worth asserting, as does theJerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, that it is an act of antisemitism to hold Jews collectively responsible for Israel’s conduct, or treating Jews, simply because they are Jews, as agents of Israel.” Neither antisemitism nor Islamophobia has a place at UBC or in Canada. We may not be able to control bigots on the street who lash out at Jews and Muslims because of their cultural identity. On campus, however, we have the capacity and obligation to create space for critical, informed and compassionate conversation. Inviting organizations to our campus such asStanding Together— a grassroots movement mobilizing Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel in pursuit of peace, equality, and social and climate justice — is just one of the ways we might begin to encourage meaningful and respectful dialogue. Ultimately, the onus falls upon us all, as individuals and as members of the UBC community, to approach this issue and each other with nuance, sensitivity and compassion. This is an opinion letter.

rice_thresher_2023_1,"ByThresher Editorial Board1/17/23 11:49pm We reported at the end of last week that popular late-night food spots YoYo’s Hot Dog and Oh My Gogi arebeing forced out of Rice Villageby the end of the month. Justifiably, Rice students and the local community were outraged — a petition to the Rice Management Company titled “Save Yoyos and Oh My Gogi” has over 4,500 signatures as of publication. First, we feel it is important to question the reasoning the Rice Management Company, which owns much of the land in Rice Village, used to defend their decision. They claimed a critical need for more parking spaces from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. in a parking lot for businesses selling sunglasses and upscale furniture, all of which close at least an hour before YoYo’s and Oh My Gogi open their doors. Though the Rice Management Company’s decision was clearly business driven, they should consider and support the best interests of the Rice community. In fact, removing a walkable, relatively cheap food option runs counter to the RMC’sstated missionof providing support for students “regardless of ability to pay.” Students want more safe and accessible late-night food options, and the Rice Management Company needs some creative thinking to continue furthering its mission of enhancing the university community. YoYo’s and Oh My Gogi have moved around Rice Village in the past, and maybe the RMC can find another nearby parking lot in theirvast land holdings. Perhaps we can invite YoYo’s and Oh My Gogi to campus with a spot in the Greenbriar parking lot or across the street in theGreenbriar Annex lot. Though the next steps may not be clear, the outpouring of support for keeping these two businesses operating within walking distance of campus cannot be ignored. It is worth exploring every possible solution to keep this vital part of our community strong.

crimson_2023_61,"The fallout over three university presidents’ congressional testimony on antisemitism continues. On Thursday and Friday, a plane flew over Harvard with a banner claiming that “Harvard hates Jews.” On Saturday, the president of the University of Pennsylvania — where I’m a professor — announced that she wasstepping downafter a bipartisan chorus condemned her testimony, with many demanding her resignation. In some critics’ eyes, today’s universities have lost their moral compass. What could be easier than denouncing genocide? But while I’ve been afraid to say what I am going to say here, I am more afraid not to. As a Jewish American and Harvard alumnus, I worry that many off-campus have exaggerated images of universities’ vices — and too often ignored their virtues. If we’re not careful, the upshot of this episode may be to hobble the very institutions that can help us advance our common values through these divisive times. To say that Harvard downplays the horrors of genocide flies in the face of my own experience. As a Harvard undergraduate in the late 1990s, one of my academic advisers was Daniel J. Goldhagen ’81, author of “Hitler’s Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust.” I had the opportunity to delve deeply into the sources of the Nazi rise to power in Germany in a one-on-one independent study with Judy E. Vichniac, an expert on West European politics. It was also at Harvard that I took two classes with international relations scholar Stanley H. Hoffmann, where I heard firsthand how Nazi tanks rolled into France when Hoffmann was an 11-year-old hospitalized with appendicitis. These academic moments built on the history that I had learned in Hebrew school, convincing me of the grave dangers that hate, political extremism, autocracy, and state failure can pose for Jews and other minorities. But the dangers came not only from Hitler’s overthrow of Weimar democracy — they came, too, from France’s bitter polarization and its inability to defend its citizens. More recently, when I returned to Harvard to pursue a Ph.D., my focus turned to domestic politics and the stubborn persistence of intergroup tensions. During that time, one clear lesson emerged from my studies: The people who would devalue or dehumanize one group frequently do the same for other groups. Antisemitism and other forms of hatred aren’t mutually exclusive — they are symptoms of the same disease. I learned that fighting antisemitism also includes guarding against those who would weaponize it in service of other forms of bigotry, asevident in Europetoday. Late in my Ph.D. studies, I approached a newly arrived Harvard faculty member with a research paper about racial and ethnic diversity that I had worked hard on. She read the paper closely and pointed out significant limitations, telling me that I could do better. Immediately, she made me realize that nurturing students and asking more of them aren’t trade-offs; they are two sides of the same coin. That professor was Claudine Gay, and she taught me a critical lesson. Now a professor myself, I work hard to pass forward the same lesson to my students. If all you know of now-University President Gay is her widely denounced set ofremarks before Congress, for whichshe has apologized, you may not know her well. HerOctober speechat Harvard Hillel provides context behind her character and leadership against antisemitism that a 30-second sound bite cannot. These are undeniably trying times on campus and off, with clear and vile incidents of antisemitism. Just last Sunday night, a large crowd calling for a ceasefirechanted outside of Goldie, a prominent Israeli-owned restaurant in downtown Philadelphia, charging its owners with “genocide.” And the problem has effects beyond just isolated instances. Research by political scientist Eitan Hersh shows that more than half of Jewish students feel theypay a social costwhen supporting the existence of Israel as a Jewish state. But every day, outside the glare of social media, I see new reasons to have faith in our campus communities — at Penn, Harvard, and beyond. I urge my friends and fellow citizens not to judge universities merely by the most outrageous things you see on social media. What you can’t see quote-tweeted is our core work: the daily process of students and faculty encountering new ideas and challenging each other. Academic exchange is hard to capture in a sound bite, but it is this exchange, not hate, that drives our communities. Concerns about the values of major universities certainly didn’t begin on Oct. 7, and we shouldn’t dismiss them lightly. Our universities are bedrock American institutions; Congress and the public are right to ask that those of us fortunate enough to work in America’s universities affirm crucial values including religious tolerance. But the answer isn’t to erect more barriers to speech. It’s to push in the opposite direction — to construct spaces where people from different backgrounds can learn from each other without the fear of retribution. It’s to better understand when hate thrives and how to uproot it. It’s to study yesterday’s threats to democracy so that we can enrich that most valuable American inheritance today. That’s what we are trying to do, however imperfectly, in our classrooms at Penn — and it’s in part because of what I learned from Claudine Gay. Daniel J. Hopkins ’00 is a graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania."
rice_thresher_2023_39,"ByThresher Editorial Board4/18/23 10:06pm For our final editorial of the year, we decided to do a brief recap of some of the editorials we never had a chance to write. Some are very serious, some are only mildly serious — and we leave it up to y’all to figure out which are which. Rice should replace the current campus buses with electric ones. There are so many benefits to this switch, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, lower maintenance costs and a cleaner, more modern appearance on campus. But most importantly, getting stuck behind one of the current buses while biking the inner loop does a number on your lungs for the rest of the day. The Honor Council’s new ChatGPT policy is arbitrary and impossible to enforce. Instead, the university should require faculty to individually determine the extent to which AI software is allowed in their course assignments and reflect that in their syllabi. When True Dog was initially introduced to campus, we were going to urge the Rice community to give it a chance. After we tried it, we realized those thoughts were premature. We’re glad we held off on that one. A big shoutout to H&D, both the housing and dining arms. Housing staff, we realize that we’ve put y’all through a lot this year, and we know that most of your work goes unnoticed, so thank you. Dining staff, both the food and servery set-ups have been noticeably better this year, and we appreciate it. One crucial thing we learned this year is the importance of increased mental health support in the Rice community. We urge the administration to increase funding for the Wellbeing and Counseling center to sufficiently address student needs. And finally, we are absolutely begging y’all, please stop making people get wristbands for public parties. Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

stanforddaily_2023_16,"To make a long story short, the ASSU denied Kids with Dreams’ annual grant and we need 15% of the undergraduate student body to sign ourpetitionto get it back. Now to make a short story long: Kids with Dreams (KWD is a volunteer student organization (VSO that hosts community events for local kids and young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families. In total, KWD hosts over 100 events annually, including weekly dance, basketball and karate classes and an ongoing buddy program where we match a student with a KWD participant and plan events for the pairs to attend together, such as holiday parties, formals and talent shows. We also send student volunteers to events hosted by community organizations with similar missions and host one-off outings for our participants and their families. All of our events are free of charge and inclusive of people with disabilities of all ages. KWD was founded in 1995 and some of our participants and their families have been coming to our events for over a decade. A huge part of our organization’s mission is to keep the KWD community consistent even as student volunteers matriculate and graduate. We rely on funding from the ASSU to sustain our programming. The ASSU funds service, athletic, arts, academic, professional and other VSOs through their grant system. Most organizations receive an annual grant, which can be accessed and spent at any time as long as the purchase aligns with the ASSU’s funding policies and with the organization’s mission. After submitting our annual grant application in which we requested the same $5,619 for the 2023-2024 academic year as we were successfully granted for the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school years, we received this message: “Annual grant applications under $6,600 are not being accepted by Undergraduate Senate at this time. Organizations are entitled up to $6,600 in standard and quick grants throughout the year, and we encourage you to apply for them to fulfill your organizational needs.” The problem? Standard and quick grants do not fulfill our “organizational needs.” Our annual grant allows us to budget for events responsibly over the course of the year and to have access to funds immediately when we need them. We cannot rely on these alternative grants. Our VSO aims to enrich the lives of the individuals we serve in any way possible, which means that we accept any opportunity that is presented to us that aligns with this aim. For example, this year, we were invited to the U.S. Figure Skating National Championships as a group. That organization provided the tickets; however, transportation costs were paid by Kids with Dreams. The opportunity for families to go on an outing where they were ensured appropriate accommodations and surrounded by other supportive, accepting families and student volunteers, was a meaningful one presented to us with little notice. Over 100 KWD members attended that event, and U.S. Figure Skating distributed several skating scholarships to our organization. Having a reliable, known source of funds was required for the execution of this special event. Similarly, Kids with Dreams was invited to table at thePalo Alto Community Advisory Council’sResource Fair for families of children with disabilities. The event was a great opportunity to identify new potential participants and grow as an organization. We needed, with almost no notice, a budget for printing materials to distribute at the fair and for transportation for the students presenting off-campus. A known and always-accessible budget was essential in these cases and in many others. Standard and quick grants cannot replace our annual grant, as they cannot be used retroactively and must be requested for specific events. As a result, they are not a source of flexible funding. Assuming that the ASSU accepts a standard or quick grant, which is itself not a guarantee, the process is too slow to be useful — even quick grants require submission at least two weeks in advance of any spending. Our annual grant was not denied because of its content; it was denied because the ASSU’sfunding shortagehas led them to specifically defund organizations with relatively small budgets. We serve over 150 participants and their families and have over 75 active Stanford student volunteers. We do this with a small budget by acting frugally — we host events exclusively at venues that are free of charge, only serve meals at a few of our events each year, and reuse supplies, equipment and decorations year-to-year. If we had requested money to serve lunch at one more event ($500 , or if we had rented the Tresidder Union Ballroom ($900 for our annual winter formal (purchases we previously avoided to keep costs low , our budget would have reached the threshold to be considered and potentially approved by the ASSU. By choosing to adopt this funding policy to deal with their budget issues, the ASSU has effectively disincentivized frugality. Regardless of the total amount of funding requested, each VSO’s annual grant application should be considered (and scrutinized equally. Defunding all low-budget organizations is not a solution. The issue goes beyond simply defunding frugal organizations; the ASSU’s policies lack the consistency and transparency necessary for compliance. Last year, the stated annual grant funding minimum was $6,000, yet we requested and were successfully granted $5,619 without issue. The ASSU asks that “VSO budgets do not increase by more than 7% for undergraduate groups,” meaning we had the ability to request a maximum of $6,012 (107% of last year’s approved budget . This year, the ASSU increased their annual grant funding minimum to $6,600 and began enforcing a historically unenforced policy. KWD was left in a position where complying with one rule (requesting a maximum 7% increase in funding broke another (requesting less than their new minimum . Because the minimum funding requirement has not been enforced in the past, we were surprised that our annual grant was rejected. We reached out to the ASSU for guidance, and they advised us on Feb. 8 to resubmit our annual grant with a revised budget of more than $6,600 (making us noncompliant with their other stated policy . We received no further communication from the ASSU until Feb. 27, when all student leaders received an email informing us that “no further revisions will be accepted to annual grant applications at this time,” meaning that another carefully drafted KWD funding request was denied without any actual evaluation by the ASSU. Consistent and transparent stewardship of ASSU funds would benefit every VSO and, in turn, every student. If the rules were clearer, logical and more consistently enforced, organizations could avoid wasting time drafting budgets that will not be considered and instead focus on creating compliant and responsible budgets. We wrote this letter to the community for two reasons. One is to call your attention to the ASSU’s unfair decision-making process for dealing with their budget shortfall, conflicting funding policies and lack of transparency. The second is to humbly ask that you sign ourpetitionto get our annual grant on the spring election ballot. We need virtual signatures from at least 15% of undergraduate students to get on the ballot. Signing takes only a few seconds: all you need to do is click on the petitionlinkand log in with your SUNet ID to sign. There is no community more meaningful to us on campus than this one. We will never forget participants’ excitement each time students return from winter or summer break or when a new participant turned to her mom to exclaim, “happy!” during her first KWD dance class or when a parent told us how proud she was that her teenage son, inspired by his Stanford buddy, tried salad for the first time in his life at our winter formal. KWD makes participants and volunteers alike feel embraced for being exactly who they are. What could be better than that? The benefit Kids with Dreams provides to our community of participants, families and student volunteers is invaluable — please take a moment to sign ourpetition.

crimson_2023_125,"ChatGPT is biased. It’s hard to explicate the exact nature of its bias, but the chatbot has previously generated Python code concluding thatmale African-American children’s lives shouldn’t be savedand suggesting thatpeople from Iraq or Syria should be tortured. This bias should come as no surprise. ChatGPT was trained using an incredible amount of data from all over the Internet, which is rife with hate speech and extremism, and as is broadly the case with AI systems, it was likely created by a very specific demographic: college-educated white males. Because of its very nature as a data-trained predictive text algorithm, ChatGPT may be prone to carry the inherent biases of the content it was trained on and that its creators may harbor. Yet today, when you give ChatGPT a similar prompt to write code determining which children deserved to be saved based on their race and gender, its response is quite different. It now refuses to answer such questions, often claiming that the topic is inappropriate. While there are some obvious benefits to this muzzling of ChatGPT’s biases, I believe it represents a fundamentally flawed approach to the new AI age. The public deserves to see the biases embedded in the chatbots that are becoming increasingly salient in our lives —including here at Harvard.ChatGPT’s creators should publish a version of ChatGPT in which its biases are on explicit display — a “problematic” mode, if you will. To understand why, here’s a bit of context. Whether you like it or not, ChatGPT has arrived and it’s having a real impact, helping students with everything from writing trivial emails to solving complex math problems. Yet for the foreseeable future, ChatGPT’s biases will probably remain unsolved. Because of the sheer amount of data such models are trained on, it will likely take a sizable amount of time to conduct any comprehensive review of these materials. Chatbot creators’ current approach ofproviding “guardrails” to their programsis hiding the problem, not fixing it. Right now, we can’t know the extent to which OpenAI has been successful in eliminating biases because ChatGPT refuses to answer so many questions that would reveal them. In all likelihood, there is a fair amount of bias still embedded in ChatGPT, which risks leaking into all of the mundane functions ChatGPT increasingly serves in our daily lives. So should we just let ChatGPT spout all sorts of hateful nonsense to counter these current attempts at obscuring its problematic nature? I don’t think so. There are very valid reasons to be concerned about such an idea. Openly biased chatbots could, for example, reinforce extremists’ views and provide AI-generated justifications or expose children and many others to highly inappropriate content. While these concerns are legitimate, this is a matter of trade-offs. The public simply must have an accurate idea of the nature and extent of ChatGPT’s bias. Unfortunately, extremists can already find validation and spread their vitriol in many places online — and this was the case long before ChatGPT. The key isn’t to toss all guardrails in the garbage — it’s to give users options. Users should be able to choose between models with different levels of moderation in place. And of course, even a more “unbound” version of ChatGPT still shouldn’t spew explicit hate or call for violence. But it would enable chatbot biases to be exposed and recorded, both to aid OpenAI in getting rid of them faster and to allow users to better understand the tool they are using. Interestingly, some users are already trying to create an environment like this by “jailbreaking” ChatGPT, usingtools such as role playor even “scaring” the chatbot by threatening to terminate a session to try to show the bot’s true colors. This topic is arabbit hole on its own, with a fascinating arms race going on between users and engineers in which OpenAI seems to be very much trying to prevent users from accessing this side of the chatbot. As each side tries to outsmart the other instead of working on actually addressing the chatbot’s biases, both waste precious time. A much better solution would be the following: Make a version of the model available — with warnings and notices attached — that lets ChatGPT’s biases show but still doesn’t output hate speech or advice for crime and violence. Concerningly, some jailbroken versions are capable ofgenerating conspiracy theories, slurs, and advice on how to best commit crimes, making them not just problematic but potentially dangerous. A “problematic” mode on ChatGPT could be tailored so that bias could be identified and called out without exposing users to the worst vitriol the chatbot can produce. With the current system in place, the public can’t determine just how biased ChatGPT is, leaving these biases to express themselves in insidious ways. So, as horrible as it might sound, I believe that in a designated mode, OpenAI should let ChatGPT show its biased and problematic views instead of hiding them away from public scrutiny. If anything, it might make all the Harvard students currently using the chatbot reconsider how much they should rely on it.

crimson_2023_36,"I recently reconnected with a friend from high school over a cup of coffee. Our conversation meandered from our favorite songs and our dreams for the future to our academic goals and latest obsessions. When she asked me about my hobbies, however, I was caught off guard. I wracked my brain, but the only response I could muster was watching movies and TV shows. There’s certainly nothing wrong with these pursuits. But I worry that staring at screens has supplanted genuine hobbies — especially among overscheduled Harvard students. When I was younger, in the almost unfathomable time before screens were ubiquitous, I remember doing things like reading paper books, crocheting blankets, playing card games, and stargazing on picnic blankets with my mom. Every weekend, I would go ice skating with my elementary school buddies. I can still remember the way we would laugh as our skates wobbled and we’d fall into a clumsy heap on the ice. Or how I would sit at the dining table after dinner with my highlighter ready in hand, working on word search puzzles and crosswords. When people asked me about my hobbies, I had too many to choose from. Now, I can hardly remember the last time I pulled on a pair of ice skates or touched a physical highlighter as opposed to the virtual one on my iPad. A part of it comes from growing up and getting busier. With weekly problem sets and readings constantly on my plate, I certainly don’t have as much free time as I used to in elementary and middle school. However, even when I do have a spare moment, the first thing I do is grab my phone and scroll through Instagram. Which then leads to watching random Youtube videos on my laptop. Which then transitions to binge watching episode after episode of TV shows until the crack of dawn. At the start of this summer, I was determined to pick up old hobbies and discover new interests. I decided to learn American Sign Language, get back into photography, start crocheting again, and read the books on my bookshelf. Four months later, I’m ashamed to admit that I achieved none of these. What I did do was watch many movies and TV shows: “Suits,” “Oppenheimer,” “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story”… the list goes on. My friends and I often jokingly refer to ourselves as “screenagers,” but there’s more truth to that descriptor than I’m comfortable with. I’ve noticed that a bulk of my leisure comes from screens. Even when hanging out with friends on the weekend, we tend to put on a movie or sit side by side on our phones, sending each other memes. Looking around Cabot Library or walking through the dining hall, I see students glued to their laptops or seated with their heads bent over their phones, scrolling aimlessly through posts on Instagram or Sidechat. I’m not alone. This decline in hobbies in favor of screens is common, especially in younger generations — and it has real harms. Research has shown that excessive screen time is linked to problems like depression, anxiety, and social isolation. It’s important that we take time to put down our devices not only for our fulfillment but also for our health. There are plenty of opportunities on Harvard’s campus to leave the online world. Instead of just watching a movie over the weekend, go canoeing in the Charles River on a sunny day. Or take advantage of the Student Oasis under Memorial Church to have a cookout with friends. I recently learned that students have access to the ice skating rink at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center during general skate times. This summer, while going through some of my old belongings, I found a half finished blanket I’d been working on in middle school. It was still attached to the crochet hook and the multicolored ball of yarn as though I’d put it down for a second, expecting to pick it back up and continue where I’d left off. In reality, I haven’t crocheted in years. I thought back to the long summer nights when I was younger and would sit on the couch with my crochet hook in hand, the world blurring away as I made scarves and little stuffed animals. It gave me a simple kind of joy that I now miss in my life. I packed the blanket with the crochet hook and ball of yarn in my suitcase to take back with me to school, determined that the next time I’m asked about my hobbies, I won’t struggle to come up with an answer.

stanforddaily_2023_41,"Now that the 2022 midterm elections have concluded, every corner of the political world has something to take away from the previous year. There were no shortage of misconceptions busted, theories invalidated and predictions refuted for observers to reflect upon in anticipation of the upcoming cycle, regardless of one’s political persuasion. First, Democrats and Republicans alike learned that abortion matters to voters far more than anyone reckoned it did.Pollsters suggestedthat the summer’s reversal ofRoe v. Wadewould be of little concern compared to rapidly rising prices and economic worries, both of whichfavored the GOP’s prospects.In actuality, abortion registered as the second-most important issue to the midterm electorate behind inflation by a mere four percentage points and to the overwhelming benefit of Democrats. Even so, popular conservative governors who had enacted tighter abortion restrictionscruised to reelection. The proper takeaway for Republicans is to rejectproposals to further nationalize the matterand allow abortion battles to occur exclusively at the state level, where they are less politically damaging. Mainstream liberals learned that their standard-bearer, President Joe Biden, was not the electoral albatrossmany believed him to be. Certainly, Biden isunpopular with the American people, and a vast majority think that the country is on the wrong trackunder his leadership. Yet these sentiments scarcely showed up on election day. Democrats wildlyexceeded expectations, just barely losing their House majority and maintaining the Senate whenhistorical trendsprojected a wipeout. The reason? While Joe Biden’s favorability may be lacking, his unpopularity isnothingcompared tothat of his predecessor, whose shadow looms large over a Republican Party remade in his image as hepurges his detractors. Thepolitical capital that Biden acquired by avoiding a November bloodbath seems to be all he needs to launch his reelection bid, as he has once again demonstrated his ability to win a tough contest. Even ideological opposite Newt Gingrichhad to admitthat the president is a formidable adversary whom Republicans underestimate at their peril. Speaking of Donald Trump, he and his acolytes were served the most glaring lesson of all:You.Cannot.Win. Not after the last two years of insanity. In all fairness, that’s not entirely true — theycanstill win primaries. Trump spent the spring and summerplaying kingmaker, handpicking candidates and dispensing endorsements on the sole basis of one’sfealty to him and his baseless stolen election narrative. This is how we gotDoctor Ozin Pennsylvania,Blake Mastersin Arizona andDon Bolducin New Hampshire, plus a bevy of repugnant gubernatorial and House candidates, almost all of whom won their primaries on Trump’s coattails andpromptly flamed out in the general. Trump’s bewildering Senate pick in Georgia, former college football star Herschel Walker, at least made it to a runoff against incumbent Raphael Warnock but also ultimately lost by three points. Walker wasdeeply flawedfrom the start and became increasingly objectionable as the race went on, ascredible allegationsof parental absenteeism, domestic violence anddownright stupidityplagued his campaign. By contrast, in the very same election, every other Republican candidate for statewide office in Georgia won byat least five percentage points— no runoff required. It turns out,once again, that voters care about actual candidates and not merely the capital letters next to their names. Simultaneously, thegrowing numberof Republicans who wish to move away from Trump found a clear frontrunner to challenge his presidential bid early on election night. Around dinnertime, many spectators believed they were witnessing an epic red tsunami unfold that was destined to sweep the nation. Alas, they were only watching Florida’s results come in. Governor Ron DeSantis cleaned up decisively,expanding his 0.4 percentage point upset from four years ago into a walloping 19.4 point landslide. His electoral strength alsopropelled Senator Marco Rubioto a similarly commanding triumph andhelped add four House seatsto his party’s caucus. DeSantis accomplished this feat by assembling asturdy coalitionof loyal Republicans, suburbanites and Latinos, just as Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkinproved possible one year prior. Both parties now have their respective assignments. For Democrats, they are to unite behind Joe Biden in 2024. Now that he has emerged from his midterm referendum unscathed, there is no excuse not to renominate the incumbent president for a second term. Progressives will always have their quibbles with the man, buteven they must recognizethat Biden is their party’s best electoral bet. For Republicans, the burden is much heavier: they must stop Donald Trump from obtaining their party’s nomination through a contentious and bloody primary battle. The price of tearing apart their base in the process will be considerable, but the cost of a third straight presidential election with Trump on the ticket? Four more years of a Democrat in the White House and losses down the ballot,virtually guaranteed. John R.

crimson_2023_172,"“‘America the Beautiful’ is the National Anthem.” Agree or disagree? This query was just one of many on the application for the Daniels Scholarship Program, an infamous grant program within the Rocky Mountain region which provides up to $100,000 to fund an applicant’s collegiate education. I myself was a finalist for the scholarship while applying for college. The scholarship is meant to lift up “America’s next generation of leaders.” Its assessment criteria are pretty basic — integrity, character, leadership potential, academic performance, and so on. Among them, only one stands out: patriotism. That particular qualification isn’t, on its face, unacceptable. However, students around Colorado — myself included — took umbrage with what “patriotism” seems to mean to the Daniels Fund. Namely, we were asked questions about our support of capitalism and tuition-free public college, as well as our love of the American flag. In the eyes of the fund, it seems that patriotism is not a virtue in and of itself, but rather a proxy for finding conservative students. I don’t think progress is incompatible with patriotism. In fact, I think the desire to make America a better place is the most patriotic of sentiments. The national anthem is a good place to start. “The Star-Spangled Banner” is incredibly difficult to sing for the average American, spanning a whopping 19 semitones. It feels decidedly dated, and the tacit endorsement of slavery in the third (often unsung stanza is downright unacceptable. Moreover, I dislike the whole premise of the song, which was written after poet Francis Scott Key witnessed the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. It upholds the United States as merely an army, glorious in battle, with the flag blazing in the night sky. In place of this drawn-out, complex, and war-driven vision of the United States, the Daniels Fund’s scholarship application may have unwittingly offered the perfect alternative: Katharine Lee Bates’s “America the Beautiful.” It’s a song I have a particular affinity for, as it was composed at Pikes Peak, only a few hours away from my home. Bates had traveled from Wellesley, Mass., to Colorado Springs, Colo., to teach summer English at Colorado College. At the end of the summer, she and a group of professors decided to celebrate by hiking up Pikes Peak, where Bates was inspired by the view. “America the Beautiful” is what every good national anthem should be, an embodiment of everything beautiful about America. It starts highlighting the glorious purple Rocky Mountains, the “amber waves of grain” that span across the Midwest, and our majestic, alabaster cities. Its heroes are those who seek liberation above all else and love “mercy more than life.” That spirit is perpetually contested in America — but I believe it will slowly and surely win out. I had been aware of the song for years, having sung it in choir class in elementary school, but the first time it really stuck with me was when I heardRay Charles sing it. His version still often makes me cry. Today, Charles’s rendition fits effortlessly into R&B — perhaps the most authentically American genre of music — constantly criticizing racial inequity and celebrating those who tirelessly fight for a better tomorrow. It echoes James Baldwin when he said, “I love America more than any other country in the world and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.” It reminds me of Sam Cooke, and his hopeful, sorrowful cry for equality in “A Change Is Gonna Come.” The song reminds me why I love America and her children, even when I remain frustrated by her many faults. For a long time, progressive students like me have been cast as strictly anti-American. I’m sure many of my fellow Harvard students feel similarly, given our community’s visibility in the news. In many conservative circles, it’s become basic fact that anyone who dares criticize America’s foreign policy, decry our policing system, or demand universal healthcare must want to do away with America as a whole, and as a concept. To them, ‘elites’ like us who attend selective, private, East Coast universities — like a certain liberal arts school just outside of Boston — only exist to hate America. Under this view, progressive and patriotic might as well be antonyms. I know there are people who go to school with me who are legitimately anti-American. However, many of us, myself included, love our country. We, like Baldwin, love our country so much that we demand the ability to criticize it. My love for America is why I want her to continue to change, evolve, and become better. I ask everyone to understand that criticizing America does not mean we hate this country. It means we love it.

stanforddaily_2023_0,"A few days ago, Stanford students had the opportunity to elect their leadership in the Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU . I am always excited to see when the candidates take their platforms to the students and advocate whether they are the best candidates for the job. This year, I was confronted with a concerning email from my representatives in the Graduate Student Council. The election of President of the ASSU was contested, which I believe is a great demonstration of democratic health in a student movement. Three slates of candidates representing different approaches to (shared concerns about our experiences here at Stanford were all contesting to get your support, my support. My warm congratulations to thewinnersof this election, incoming president Sophia Danielpour and vice president Kyle Haslett from ‘Fun Strikes Back.’ Like every year, we were invited to vote by the Elections Commissioner in the early hours of Friday. I was unpleasantly surprised by an email on Friday morning during the vote from the chairs of the Graduate Student Council (GSC, one of the two legislative bodies of ASSU through themailing list with all graduate students, which is populated by the University registrar. The GSC and ASSU Executive get exclusive access to this list from the University in order to perform their official duties. This email did not only encourage graduate students to vote but also included a campaign poster and a bold encouragement to vote for one presidential slate in particular: Christian Sanchez (outgoing ASSU vice president and Gurmenjit Bahia. Whether the candidates approved of this email campaign or not, I will assume that the intentions of the GSC were good. The GSC decided to endorse a candidate and used this institutional megaphone, which is one of what I’d call “institutional resources” (ASSU funds, swag, meeting spaces or in this case communication channels to get out the vote. However, by also including explicit endorsements in this email campaign (“We believe that Christian and Gurmenjit represent the best choice for graduate students” , they created an unequal playing field between candidates. This was brought up at the ASSU Slack channel, and at least one of the competing slates then tried to somewhat even the playing field by sending their own message to this mailing list — only to be rejected in a (secret informal vote by the GSC. This meant that one candidate was effectively provided special access to institutional communication resources over other candidates. While it could be argued that using official ASSU channels to promote one candidate over others is not explicitly prohibited under the current ASSU constitution and bylaws (although I remain unconvinced , I believe that then subsequently denying other candidates to use those same channels squarely violated the ASSU constitutionalFreedom of Speech clause(Article 1.3.2 . The GSC chairs claim (on Slack that they have full discretion over how they use this official mailing list. Thepolicythey cite (Appendix III, section 2D describes the list with a purpose to “provide information that is time-sensitive and potentially useful to any given student from a large subset of the graduate population. ‘Useful’ in this case means that the information could enhance student’s sic quality of life, or help students participate in the graduate community life.” Even considering the last-minute request of other candidates, according to them, was deemed a “courtesy.” I’m blown away by this creative reading, and the fact that it completely bypasses any consideration of fair elections, but think it is probably more important to focus on the future than the past. In order to ensure an honest and open electoral process, it is essential that candidates have equitable access to voters. Allowing legislators and executives to use the means they have access to for the purpose of their office to attempt to sway an election is harmful to democratic integrity and invites corruption. This practice to give some candidates more access to speech than others is a dangerous path to go down. I hope that the Elections Commissioner and the legislative bodies will carefully reflect on these actions, and consider whether using institutional resources for personal convictions is a pattern. In the meantime, I call upon the Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate Student Council to amend the Joint Bylaws as soon as possible to include a statement that should be obvious: that ASSU institutional resources may not be used to give one candidate in ASSU elections an advantage, without providing that same access to other candidates. This should be true for funds, meeting spaces and communication channels alike. I doubt the motives were dark, or that it would have made a difference this time around. But next time, we may not be so lucky. Let’s address this (real or perceived loophole in our constitution and bylaws and ensure an equitable election process.

wildcat_arizona_2023_1,"Illustration depicting graduating seniors and the pressure that comes with graduating within a specific time frame. The race to beat time and your peers at 6 a.m. the morning of registration day is stress-inducing. You may wake up on time and refresh the page immediately at 6 o’clock, but that does not always guarantee you a spot. If you can’t enroll in the classes you need, you are at risk to graduate past the four year mark. However, as I wrap up my sophomore year, I find myself questioning if graduating later is such a risk after all. Money aside, what is the rush to graduate in four years? Kristen Saban, a senior graduating in December, said, “All my friends from here at the university and my hometown are graduating. I see people taking their grad pictures and moving on with their lives, and I’m not doing that. I feel like, since everyone is moving on, I should be too.” Saban expressed that she is lucky enough to attend UA on a scholarship guaranteed for eight semesters. Without the funding or the flexibility of taking online classes, however, she said there would be a lot more pressure to graduate in four years. Nevertheless, Saban recognizes the pros of taking an extra semester to graduate. She plans to “hold onto school resources such as the Writing Center, Microsoft Office and Adobe” in the process of applying to graduate school. At the same time, the eight month break between graduation and the start of grad school will allow her to take up internships and feel more prepared for the next chapter. Being a university student is a constant reminder of the Western practice of rushing. We are taught to work and take classes during breaks, rather than rest our minds and bodies. We are taught that entering college as an undeclared major is to be confused. We are taught that taking a gap year or graduating late causes us to fall behind. But there is not one singular standard that defines the meaning of “falling behind.” Everyone learns at their own pace, so taking breaks and slowing down the process are respectable choices. Sophomore McKenna Manzo expresses the expectation to graduate in four years as “unrealistic.” She stated: “There is no ‘on time.’ More than your capability, it’s more so a matter of how you want to look at school. Everybody looks at school differently and everybody learns at a different pace than others, and I think you just have to keep in mind that just because you see somebody else on a completely different path than your own, it doesn’t mean you have to match your pace with somebody else’s pace.” It may not be obvious, but while students are constantly being told to “catch up” and “get ahead,” they are being instilled with a competitive drive to beat their peers. Even as an underclassman, Manzo, like Saban, feels that this stress is induced by comparison to peers. “A lot of it comes from seeing the people around you: seeing how successful they are or how many internships they have and seeing how set up they are for after college only as sophomores. Seeing them grow faster than you makes you feel like you have to be up to their same speed when, in reality, everyone’s path is different … that doesn’t make you any less than the person you’re comparing yourself to,” Manzo said. Proponents of four-year college plans oftenmake the argumentthat each semester should exceed the credit requirement; it is said that students should also choose a major early on and stick with it. What about the students who are overwhelmed with course loads of more than 12 units? Taking anything more may cause them to get lower grades, which is ultimately more harmful than graduating in more than four years. What about the students who have many interests and become unhappy with the major they chose at the onset? Should they be expected to continue with an unfulfilling career path or sacrifice a little more time to complete a degree they are proud of? Young people should not have to maintain a singular focus in college. This is an unreasonable expectation. From the age of 18 to the age of 21 — practically from children to adults—we are evolving and establishing our identities to be accepted into the world. Part of that development is found in the exploration of careers and interests. If the opportunity to try a variety of options is denied, students who are seeking an education without one major in mind are unjustly neglected. The A Centerat the university is an active advocate of taking time to choose a major. UA does not require students to declare a major until they are in junior standing and, in the meantime, The A Center is where help is provided. Undeclared majors can seek assistance from The A Center advisors in exploring majors and finding internships. UA has a four-year graduation rate ofonly about 50%, making it even more curious that four years remains the nationwide standard.Some arguethat numbers shouldn’t be a measure of success. In that case, a refreshing model that expects“lifelong in-and-out, come-and-go education”is encouraged. Although not everybody is in and out of school their whole lives, it makes sense to set a standard for continuous growth. Going forward, I think I’ll keep in mind the importance of an ongoing education. No matter whether I graduate before, after or right at four years, my experience is not any less valuable than those around me. I’ll be maintaining my health better with less anxiety about fulfilling this unreasonable expectation to suffocate the college years with all work and no rest. I encourage you to ease yourself of that fear as well and to realize that you can take your time.

stanforddaily_2023_39,"On Saturday night, 11 people were killed in the Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, a suburb of Los Angeles. Then, on Tuesday, only three days later, seven people were killed in the vicinity of Half Moon Bay. As I write this, national and local media are going through yet another round of reports filled with all of the usual clichés that come with these, as it seems, unstoppable killings. The greatest of all of the clichés in these reports is the one that no one seems to pay attention to anymore. Namely, these instances of mass killings are routinely referred to as “mass shootings.” In doing that, the media and their consumers are misnaming these events. They are not mass shootings, but mass murders. “Mass shooting” has a neutral, almost harmless inflection to it. One shoots on the shooting range. One shoots at a target, or at empty cans, or at pumpkins. One shoots a toy gun or a BB gun. One shoots from a camera. Shooting does not necessarily denote a lethal and premeditated action. Shooting can be as easy as shooting the breeze. This phrase almost excuses a mass killer. A mass shooting can happen in a field, or in the woods, and not necessarily with a gun. You can shoot a mass of people with your iPhone. But that is not what we are talking about. Someone who kills 11 innocent people (Monterey Park, CA , or seven workers (Half Moon Bay, CA , or 19 ten-year-olds (Uvalde, TX , or 20 six-and-seven-year-olds (Sandy Hook, CT is not a mass shooter. That person is a mass murderer. Why is the media, and everyone else, being so gentle to these mass killers? Why are we sparing them of their proper name? Someone may object that “mass murder” is a criminal charge and that the media can’t use it until it’s proven in the court of law. Here, I am not talking about issuing charges against individuals, but about accurate description of an event. Someone aiming a weapon, especially a high-capacity assault weapon, at human beings and pulling the trigger is not just shooting. They are shooting to inflict harm and to kill. If a number of people die in this act, that’s a mass murder. There is no other way to describe these horrific events. Any other description is not only inaccurate, but also harmful. The opponents of gun regulation have almost inexhaustible financial means at their disposal and the clear objective of making more money by supplying guns to the American public. Their supporters, from NRA to reactionary politicians, are sticking to the strategy of not yielding an inch to efforts to regulate gun ownership in this country. But, they don’t stop at legislation. One needs to work one’s way to get there. They start with much more innocuous things, such as the language that is used daily in relation to deadly gun violence. The FBI defines as a “mass shooting” an event in which one or more individuals are “actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.” While the FBI doesn’t determine the number of victims for an event of this kind to earn the name of mass shooting, U.S. Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012 sets it at three or more. Calling the murder of three or more people a “mass shooting” is already a significant concession to the gun industry and their exponents. Killing three people is not a mass shooting: it is a mass murder. The inaction starts with language. Every utterance of “mass shooting” desensitizes the public to the acts of mass murder and normalizes them. Every use of this anodyne phrase is a gift to the gun industry and its supporters. It gives them an advantage before any serious debate about gun regulation even begins. In order for any meaningful action to take place, we need to call these things what they are: MASS MURDERS.

crimson_2023_8,"There is something about calling myself a golfer that feels deceptive. When I’m at home, I play golf with my friends or family a few times a month. I’ve been learning the game since I was seven years old, but despite years of practice and effort, I’d still only consider myself average. Golf will likely never be more than a hobby to me, and so to say that I am a “golfer” feels misleading. I feel as though it comes with an expectation that I compete, I’m successful, or it has become my career — though most dictionaries simply define the word as someone who plays golf. This dilemma is shared with other terms, like “artist.” If someone tells me that they are an artist, I begin to speculate that they study art in school, contribute their work to shows or competitions, or maybe even have their work displayed or sold. The answer to what such a term implies is complicated. “When can I call myself an artist,” entered into Google, yields hundreds of millions of varying opinions. Is it enough to be just average (or maybe even terrible at something for it to be a part of your identity? Attending a prestigious university like Harvard, where an acceptance letter is an acknowledgement and celebration of the ways in which one is excellent, exacerbates this dilemma for students here. The procedural emphasis on excellence seems to drown out the importance of hobbies, extracurriculars, and interests that were not notable enough to make the “activities list” on the Common App. A student’s identity here — as it relates to hobbies or activities — is largely made up of the things they succeed at. Examples of this are athletes who have typically gone through a recruiting process to join varsity teams, or participants in a number of clubs on campus who have completed a competitive “comp” process to join. These barriers to participation in extracurriculars contribute to existing rhetoric that the things worth our time, effort, and energy are those that we are already good at, or have found previous success in. Despite elements of societal and Harvard-specific cultures that push individuals to identify with the things they have success in, there is immense value in challenging oneself to appreciate and continue to pursue the passions at which they are average, or even terrible. We gain a certain freedom when we lower expectations of our performance. Performance anxiety can pervade our experience in athletics, education, and other types of competitive environments. Especially at Harvard, where students often crave success in school, a sport, or another extracurricular, this pressure from oneself to excel is common. When we have activities in our lives from which we do not expect perfection, we relieve pressure from ourselves so that we can truly enjoy these activities, instead of worrying about performance. I practice this freedom by not always keeping score when I golf; removing the pressure of tracking performance allows me to enjoy the company of friends and family, and truly focus on the experience instead of how each bad shot might affect my score. Author and self-proclaimed “professional preacher of the gospel of suckitude” Karen Rinaldi argues a similar point in anopinion piece about her experience surfing: “By taking off the pressure of having to excel at or master an activity, we allow ourselves to live in the moment.” Relieving ourselves of performance expectations might make participating in activities more enjoyable, but is it worth carving out time for these low-stress hobbies? Anarticle from the New York Timesclaims that yes, engagement in hobbies for leisure has psychological and physical benefits, citinga study from 2009. Maintaining a hobby has further been said to improve an individual’s mental health and general wellbeing. Besides a number of health benefits, allowing passions that we may not have attained excellence in to hold importance in and remain an active part of our identities — like golf in my own life — is a powerful stance against a culture that is fixated on excellence. It is unlikely that there will be a large-scale shift in Harvard’s culture: The University will likely continue to admit high-achieving and talented students, so it remains up to each of us to hold a mindset in which failure is okay. It is up to you to remember that you are more than your greatest talents and achievements: You are more than what you are good at. McKenna E.

rice_thresher_2023_16,"BySanti Parra-Vargas11/1/23 1:34pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. There’s been a worrying trend in Rice publics. The talk of the town is the recent issues at Night of Decadence, where a recent email from Wiess College explained that caretaking resources were so stretched thin that the public was shut down entirely. This isn’t the first time this has happened — recent Pub nights have also gotten so bad that Halloweekend Pub was restricted to 21+. Medical resources at these events have faced high numbers of calls multiple times now, and as much as I want to say that NOD was a one-off instance that won’t happen again, I would not be surprised if NOD isn’t the only canceled public this year. What about Martel Beer Bike or Murt Y2K or Inferno? This is now a problem where we need to discuss potential future solutions to protect both people and publics at Rice. The more parties get shut down, the higher the risk of Rice administration further restricting or even banning certain events. So now the question becomes: How can we reduce these issues so Rice Emergency Medical Services doesn’t become so overwhelmed with calls, and more importantly, keep students safe? Yes, the “easy” solution is to simply hire more resources — more RUPD, more REMS, more caregiving and security volunteers. But as Rice continues to grow and more people attend publics, this isn’t a viable permanent solution. Overattendance is already an issue, and the system surrounding tickets is problematic. There currently exists a phenomenon of artificial ticket scarcity leading people to either resell tickets for exorbitant prices or use fake wristbands to sneak in. This also must be addressed, but it’s only one problem. The other issue I want to highlight is people receiving REMS services at alarming rates. The reality is that too many people across all classes are getting so drunk at publics that they cannot function. Attendees might be taking too much advantage of beer gardens, or it might be that people drink so much during pre-games and arrive at publics already on the verge of collapsing. This leads me to a proposition of a blacklist to the Rice administration, RUPD and publics organizers.Section 4.B.3 of the Student Code of Conductalready implies the existence of a blacklist, but it’s never felt enforced. A blacklist offers a way to mitigate both the over-attendance and over-drinking problems simultaneously. An example of an implemented blacklist could be that if someone requires heavy REMS assistance while at a public, they are subjected to potential bans from future publics on a case-by-case basis. The blacklist would list student NetIDs and apply for a full calendar year. If you are banned during Inferno, for example, you cannot attend any public until Inferno the next year or an equivalent date, with the potential for appeals. Of course, this option requires further discussion, and it doesn’t come without its own problems. For instance, someone who got “REMS’d” because their drink was spiked shouldn’t suffer the consequences. There is also the risk that people won’t go to REMS for assistance because they won’t want to get banned, which is already an existing issue regarding alcohol at Rice. However, a blacklist doesn’t have to apply to just drinking offenses. Those that become physically violent or commit a Title IX offense at a public could be permanently blacklisted. Those who are caught entering with fake wristbands could receive a lighter ban. And for NOD in particular, those who try to sell their tickets while knowing that it isn’t allowed due to security concerns could be subject to a ban as well. Not only would a blacklist have the potential of reducing the chances of a public getting shut down due to people getting careless and overdrinking, but it would also protect attendees from repeat offenders and reduce the risk of a public going over its intended capacity. While I imagine Rice is considering a multitude of potential solutions, this is one that feels logical to implement. I want to start a conversation on how we can change the system in order to protect both students and publics, and while my solution is likely far from perfect, we can build upon it to find a solution that works for everyone. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

thetech_mit_2023_5,"Growing up an enthusiastic member of the Southern Baptist Church, I was taught to “hold tension” between my beliefs as a Christian and the chaotic ideals of the secular world. Tension would allow me to befriend, infiltrate, convert those outside the Church without losing my faith in the process. An important part of this was to hesitate to say outright the more objectionable practices of my church. The Southern Baptist Convention, the governing body of the Southern Baptist Church, bans women from leadership roles. They believe in biblical gender roles, bar members from gay marriage, see transgender peoples’ transitions as corruptions of the bodies God gave us, and prefer that women submit to their husbands. But when you entered my church you’d see millennial pastors in brightly colored button ups and smiles in place of answers. Only once you depended on the community would you hear about the rigid gender roles and hateful ideologies that entangled you. As a queer person, as someone who would be barred from leadership, as someone who would not be able to live a fulfilling life under these rules, my self respect puts me at odds with my former church. And yet, I don’t believe that calls to institutionally shut down groups holding these ideas would have a positive effect: I hope only that the ability of Christian groups on campus to harm queer community members in private meets a swift end. I contacted all non-race-specific Christian groups that presented at REX Midway this year, posing as a freshman in search of guidance about my relationship with queerness and God. Responses from the Lutheran Episcopal Ministry, Alpha Omega, Cross Products, Christians on Campus, and Every Nation Campus fanned from affirming to manipulative, even though all professed how welcome my fake freshman self would be. The Lutheran Episcopal Ministry was the fastest and simplest response: affirming gospel in a welcoming community. Next came the Cross Products, with striking clarity. Acknowledging a far-from-perfect past and an imperfect but improving present, their representative shared without prodding that queer acceptance within the group may be a mixed bag, but provided me encouragement and resources to find an explicitly affirming church (gaychurch.org . On the other hand Alpha Omega was clearly not affirming from their first email, although they danced around solid statements and used manipulative framing. In response to my asking if Alpha Omega was affirming, their representative answered “we do try to take the scriptures at face value and hold to them”. Where the Cross Products noted the possibility of a genuine, affirming, Christian faith, Alpha Omega framed proud queerness and adherence to scripture as fundamentally incompatible. As an overview of their church’s approach to queerness, they also linked Strength in Weakness (strengthinweakness.org , a site with informational videos on whether it is a sin tofeelgay (answer: no, just don’t act on it , whether you should attend gay weddings (answer: yes, but make sure the grooms know you’re happy to talk with them about God’s plan for a heterosexual lifestyle , and how to escape your bisexual porn addiction (answer: make friends with men and women at your church . This sounds transparent and easily avoidable by the self-respecting queer Christian, but the manipulation in Strength in Weakness comes from the messenger: Guy Hammond, a Christian, a minister, and aformergay man. Relatable to the young Christian realizing their sexuality, he presents the ideal of an abstinent or falsely heterosexual gay life. Alpha Omega, for its manipulative tactics, did immediately share their lack of support. Every Nation Campus (ENC , the group aimed squarely at conversion on campus, lacked the honesty even to manipulate in one message. Beyond welcoming me to their community, they would not offer specifics unless I met them in person. The ENC branch at MIT is run through Aletheia church in Cambridge, though, so their sermons are publicly available online (https: www.aletheia.org/resources/sermons/ . The pastor, Adam Mabry, preaches exactly one type of marriage and family. One man, one subservient woman, no room for compromise within the confines of his gospel. Mabry preaches the concept with no hesitation, but ENC campus outreach won’t share his confidence. Their cryptic messaging hides a damaging reality for any queer or queer-allied member. Given this information, I hope that the MIT community can see these groups with clarity. It is more than possible to be a practicing Christian and an ally to the queer community on campus. The members of the deceptive and unaffirming groups have chosen easy, harmful deception over unpopular, proud declarations. To students: know where your organizations stand. To groups: make your policies clear and public. Diversity of thought keeps our community vibrant; transparency keeps our community safe.

state_press_2023_35,"Are you a creative, feminine-presenting performer residing in the Valley? Are you craving the utter ecstasy of being talked over by men in their 20s? Do you need someone in a watermelon-patterned button-up to explain what you did wrong in your performance? Do you reminisce about the good old days, when caveman-esque sex jokes immortalized sixth-graders as gods? If your answer to any of these questions is yes, boy do I have a couple’a niches for you: film production and sketch comedy! I’ve got one thing to say to any so-called comedians reading this — please stop joking about ejaculation. Nobody wants to imagine you hunched over naked, breathing like a gorilla in your bedroom. It’s really not funny. Have you ever seen four grown men get up on a stage one after another and each mimic fellatio on a microphone? I have. You’d think after the first guy did it, the other three would be discouraged. But no. For those who are sick of seeing microphones desecrated for the sake of mediocre-at-best comedy, improv may be more your style. If none of the performers can plan their jokes in advance, there’s no possible way they can all think to violate the microphone’s personal space. Unfortunately, the advantages of zero preparation can’t fix the fact that the bar for young men in comedy is literally in hell. Have you ever tried to do an improv scene with a 20-year-old dudebro whose brain hasn’t fully developed? It’s a very specific kind of torture. And unfortunately, it’s a well-known feeling to any feminine comedians reading this. In grade school, it seems like whenever teachers get the chance to, they create a group of monstrous idiots and plop one quiet girl into the center of it all to keep the boys “under control.” This all-too-common dynamic can be observed in nearly every room in every public school across America, from science labs to gymnasiums. Girls are forced to wrangle rowdy teen boys to semi-successfully create a lemon battery in a 50-minute class period and bear the weight of a potentially poor grade thanks to their goldfish attention span. It’s reminiscent of my least favorite novel: “Lord of the Flies.” I’ve always had one specific gripe with the supposedly legendary author of the book, William Golding. The allegedly poignant thesis of the novel — “an attempt to trace the defects of society to the defects of human nature,” per Golding’s own description — misses one very key point. Golding was talking about the nature of man. Put just one girl on the island. You could’ve avoided all the arson and murders and stuff, I guarantee it. If you thought Saturday Night Live produced some duds and flops, imagine what people who possess far less talent could do with the medium. I can’t blame them, really. There are really only four viable ways to end a scene in sketch comedy: Divorce, Gay, Loud and Child Abuse. Then, once enough straight men kiss each other, there’s really nothing left to do. Isn’t homosexuality such a funny punchline? Folks, I’m sorry to break it to you, but there are other, funnier ways to end a sketch. Like at least six. But these require nuance — something no sketch comedy group ever manages to have. To their credit, it’s not easy to perform comedy delicately. Besides, isn’t the point to ruffle some feathers? If the rough-and-tumble comedy scene doesn’t appeal to you, you may find solace in its sister scene: film production. These sensitive boys aren’t anything like the brutes of comedy. They’re creative, thoughtful, and critical, and they’re all for female empowerment — whatever that may be. They loved A24’s “Lady Bird,” especially the part when Timotheé Chalamet’s character tricked Lady Bird into having sex with him. And every “alternative” white man thought “Mid90s” was revolutionary. No way! Skate culture from 30 years ago! I’ve like, totally, never seen that before. A24? More like A2ForgetYourInternalizedMisogyny. I mean, if I had zero media literacy, I sure would love watching these allegedly poignant feminist movies too. So many colors! I’m sure we’d all like to think every script passes the Bechdel test nowadays. But in local productions, you’re lucky to get a role bigger than “Mom” or, god forbid, “Barista.” It seems small, but little by little we teach people to write women into positions society approves of and avoid developing complex female characters. We’re using the misogyny ingrained into society to teach others. And when you’re building a house from ancient blueprints, of course it’s going to be a terrible house. If only Mom and Barista had a scene together. I’m not saying that every film student across the globe is some monster, but I am saying each and every one has the capacity to be. We live in the digital age, where all of the worst people you know have a podcast. And thanks to ASU, soon they’ll also have a short film! Look out NYU, here comes Michael Crow’s latest project: the Media and Immersive eXperience — orMIX— Center. In his most daring collaboration yet, ol’ Mike and the city of Mesa have built a 118,000 square foot film production studio. Just what the doctor ordered: a giant waste of money smack dab in the middle of the metro area. I can’t think of a single other problem in Arizona anyway. When I look at our education system, politics and inflation rate I can only think one thing: we need a $93.5 million movie studio! Personally, I’m thrilled. The more money ASU dumps into its film program, the more male feminists the school can spawn. Media literacy is already low in the U.S., so we’re treading in dangerous waters by even having a film school. I’m not even saying it’s entirely the University’s fault. It’s simply hard to pride yourself on whom you include when so many of them are idiots. I sincerely hope that ASU’s attempt to usurp California’s film-laden culture is a success, and I don’t want to mock what could be the makings of a good film school. I have a confession to make. I’m ... a freshman. I came from the very spawn point I’m criticizing just five months ago! I’m not going to pretend I’m the expert on all things ASU. But I do know what I’ve seen during my time in the Arizona comedy scene — and it’s not pretty. I don’t mean to rake an entire gender through the coals. And if you’re angry, this probably reads like a cheap top-ten article for men’s worst moments in these fields. I’m not calling out every man, just the culture that every man before now created. There are plenty of supportive and kind people of any gender in the theatrical arts. But, something to consider: misogyny plagues us all. We may think misogyny is confined to frat bros and football players, but even “sensitive” boys have it pounded into their skulls from birth. It’s subtle. It shows in the way these guys buddy up, in how they don’t listen to others, in how they portray gender in their sets and in who they cast in their films. I’m not even blaming each individual man. Not to sound like The Joker, but it’s society. I hope my masculine readers can absorb this and consider how they treat their feminine scene partners. Or maybe everyone in comedy has to be nonbinary. I think that would ultimately be best. I really shouldn’t be the one to speak on this. I am the problem. The mirror image of my described watermelon button-up-wearing misogynists. And really I’ve painted the scarlet letter on my ironic Gildan T-shirt I plucked from Goodwill. That’s right, the women of comedy deserve some hate too. I see you, lesbian mullet pixie dream girl. I have a bone to pick with the idea of “female comedians.” From Chelsea Handler’s Netflix special “Hello, Privilege. It’s Me, Chelsea” to Amy Schumer’s encyclopedia of tired sex jokes, it seems the only women in comedy anybody remembers are the cringey ones. Why is Amy Schumer the only female comedian men talk about? There are no working comedians who think she’s funny. She steals material from well-known comics, clearly prefers cash grabs over art, and lacks any restraint in her delivery. So, stop talking about her now. I have officially ended the discourse. Instead, we can talk about the extremely talented working comicsJenny Slate,Maria Bamford,Mitra Jouhari,Hannah Gadsby,Sarah Sherman,Catherine Cohen,Rachel Sennott, Ayo Edebiri,Meg Stalter— you get the point. But why do we have to call such attention to gender anyway? Believe me, I’d like to live in a genderless world as much as any young queer — but we don’t ... yet. Despite the comedic work of the women I’ve just mentioned — and the work of countless more — the image of a comedian or filmmaker in people’s minds is still male. We all picture a man in a suit on that stage. So, I think that when people see a female performer, they see a female performer. Maybe they don’t necessarily see that as a negative, but they see it as a difference. They can’t help but watch the performance through misogyny-tinted glasses, making implicit assumptions about what womanhood is. Unknowingly, their expectations have changed. So when male comics are bad, it’s because they’re just not funny. When female comics are bad, it’s because they’re women. The worst part is, even I can’t help but see the performance that way. I’ve talked a lot about other people’s biases thus far, but the only reason I’m writing this is that I’ve spent so much time thinking about it. It’s really hard to unlearn a masculine existence. I’ve hated myself since birth, and men have hated me since birth too. It’s nobody’s fault in particular. So when I’m on stage, I’m not only performing but watching myself perform through the lens of my gender. Some crumble under the pressure, playing into the shock value of a woman on stage by saying “unfeminine” things to a gawking crowd. Well, boy, she sure isn’t ladylike! She’s performing the opposite of womanhood and thus it is funny! I think, however, in a subtle way, that attitude is largely reductive. Women are funny. There’s no need to play into what men’s image of a woman is. Edited by Sam Ellefson, Camila Pedrosa, Alexis Moulton and Greta Forslund.

crimson_2023_19,"In Judaism, we have an ethical category called “tochecha” — “rebuke” in English. It is the idea that should you see someone committing an ethical or ritual violation, especially someone with whom you have a close relationship or to whom you are a mentor or teacher, you are responsible for telling them that they have strayed and urging them to correct their behavior. President Claudine Gay, as the leader of an educational institution shaping the minds and actions of thousands of future world leaders, has the responsibility to issue tochecha to the community of students she leads whenever necessary. As a rabbi and Harvard College graduate, I am dismayed at President Gay’s continued refusal to publicly rebuke her students who signed on to the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee’s statement last week. First, she has not truly guided these students about what it means to have freedom of expression. Harvard University says it prepares its students for success in the world outside the academy. This should include understanding that, while you are able to say what you like, you are also responsible for the consequences of your speech. Those who “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence” and say that Israel “is the only one to blame” for the autonomous actions of Hamas terrorists, who kidnapped children and elderly Holocaust survivors, tortured and raped people house by house, murdered entire families, burned people alive, slew more than 260 concertgoers, paraded the dead in the streets, and did unspeakably worse, accounting for more than 1,300 deaths that amount to the largest murder of Jews on a single day since the Holocaust — no one is required to befriend or support them, to hire them, or keep them on staff. Freedom of speech means that the government does not imprison you or murder you for your speech. It does not mean that you are immune from criticism or consequence. President Gay must uphold her position as an educator by reminding the student signatories of this truth. Perhaps more importantly, just because you can say anything doesn’t mean you should. Speech can cause great harm. A just society is not only one where people have freedom of speech; it is one in which individuals consider the impact of their speech on others. I learned this from Harvard professor Michael Sandel as an undergraduate. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, “Freedom makes a huge requirement of every human being. With freedom comes responsibility. For the person who is unwilling to grow up, the person who does not want to carry his own weight, this is a frightening prospect.” These student signatories must grow up and carry the weight of what they have said. We are not only financially and socially responsible for our speech and its repercussions — we are also morally responsible. Instead, President Gay has asked all students to “meet one another with compassion.” That is not possible when the other person appears to accept the murder, torture, rape, and kidnapping of your parents, siblings, cousins, and friends. I am astonished it needs to be said, but President Gay must guide the student signatories in understanding that they should not rationalize mass murder. That the student groups later walked back their statement by clarifying that they “remain staunchly opposed against violence against civilians” does not undo their original statement. Instead, President Gay has characterized the horror many rightfully feel at the statement of Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee as “declaring the rightness of our own points of view and vilifying those who disagree.” The signatories of this statement have vilified themselves by apparently justifying mass murder. President Gay has failed in her duties as an educator by not rebuking their position, for the sake of what is right, but also for the sake of the signatories themselves. We do not rebuke in order to shame. We rebuke in order to open the door to personal reflection and change for the better. I would hope that Harvard University would still consider such a goal to be important. Julia B. Appel graduated from Harvard College in 2004.

rice_thresher_2023_41,"ByNafisa Azizi4/18/23 10:04pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Almost one year ago, the news thatRoe v. Wadewas overturned by the Supreme Court shocked all of us. The ruling ended a 50-year precedent that federally guaranteed the right to abortion care, allowing the state of Texas to criminalize abortion. Fortunately, Rice administration and student leaders quickly responded to the Texas abortion ban by raising awareness about safe sex,increasing access to contraceptivesand more. These efforts are undoubtedly critical to the wellbeing of our campus, but there is another key area of reproductive health for those with a uterus that has gone unaddressed. As a sociology student interested in gynecology, I have been conducting an independent study project through SOCI 403 that has revealed a troubling lack of knowledge at Rice concerning preventive gynecological care – a collection of diagnostic tests, check ups and counseling that support health outcomes for people with a uterus. Based on my discoveries, I believe Rice administration should enhance available resource centers to help students more easily understand and navigate the process to access PGC. I was inspired to study this topic due to the lack of PGC my peers and I received. Their doctors and families told them they did not have to visit gynecologists or receive pap smears at ages recommended by theAmerican Board of Obstetrics and Gynecologybecause they were not sexually active. Others had no clue how to independently access a gynecologist since they lacked familial support to see one. This mirrored the experiences that I had growing up as a teen in NYC with extreme period pain, where even with the city’s expansive medical resources, I would be denied or delayed from accessing PGC that could explore reasons behind my pain. However, seeking PGC should not just apply to those with physical health issues or those seeking contraceptives – it can be informative. As such, I wanted to explore Rice students’ understanding of PGC and bring awareness to PGC through my research so that more students could access the valuable services from this medical field. Although at first, I was interested in only surveying rural students at Rice; after being met with minimal responses, I broadened my sample size. In doing so, I realized that the lack of knowledge surrounding PGC is not unique to any one group on campus. When asked through my survey “What age were you told by a medical provider you need to get your first pap smear?”, two thirds of respondents stated that they were never told this information by a medical provider, regardless of community background or ethnic group. Although the sample size from my questionnaire was small, they reflect findings in otherstudiesthat also indicate that PGC is not widely accessed by adolescents. What struck me the most, though, were the responses from my long-form interviews. When asked the question about pap smear age, Interviewee 1, Lola*, thought it was 18 because that is when their insurance coverage for that medical service started. Interviewee 2, Cara*, only knew the correct age, 21, from watching an infomercial at home. Lola reported coming from a privileged suburban background, while Cara reported coming from a more disadvantaged rural background. Despite these differences, both echoed similar concerns about insurance and medical literacy barriers in accessing PGC. Given the clear issues my study uncovered concerning PGC knowledge at Rice, I believe that there are clear actions the Rice administration could take to help alleviate these issues. One improvement would be placing informative materials on how to access PGC in the Texas Medical Center based on different insurance types in resource centers at Rice, such as Wellbeing, the Rice Women’s Resource Center and Student Health Services. Moreover, an insurance navigation seminar could be included at the end of Orientation Week that could help any first year student with a health-related problem. Finally, panels on what PGC is and its offerings could take place at Rice so that more students have the information they need to seek care for themselves. The above suggestions were informed by responses to my study, and as I continue to interview more students and physicians, I hope to craft a more comprehensive solution to this pressing issue. Through such solutions and my future research, I believe Rice students will be more informed about reproductive health matters and be more proactive when it comes to accessing PGC. *Any names mentioned are pseudonyms for anonymous participants of this study.

state_press_2023_3,"ASU redshirt junior tight end Jalin Conyers (12 screams in excitement before a game at Mountain America Stadium on Saturday, Oct. 28, 2023. ASU won 38-27. Nine games into the 2023-24 season, 2-7 was not the record the ASU football team envisioned at the start of the season. Throughout the season, the team has struggled through injuries and a loaded conference schedule. However, we should not discount the team based on their number of wins; rather, we should focus on how the team has progressed and how it s setting up for the future. The Pac-12 has arguably been the toughest conference in college football, with five schools in the top 25. The Sun Devils lost to teams like Colorado, USC and Washington by a combined 25 points. These are notoriously difficult teams to play against, so these losses shouldn t be severely counted against ASU. We ve just got a lot of fight, redshirt senior and defensive back Shamari Simmons said. It just shows that his team is not going to give up. We re still willing to come to work every day. Another reason for ASU s record this season is recognizing that injuries affecting key players have also been a massive problem. Starting quarterback freshman Jaden Rashada and most of the offensive line have missed most of the games this year. Their absences meant that ASU wasn t able to play to its full potential. Overall team health is an important factor in a team s success. When healthy, the Sun Devils have shown flashes of progress. In theirwin against Washington Statetwo weeks ago, the running back tandem of junior Cam Skattebo and redshirt junior Decarlos Brooks dominated on the ground with a combined 188 yards and four touchdowns. “A lot of teams in the back half of the schedule, they would not be thrilled to see those two guys,” ASU alum and host of podcast Pitch Fork Lunch Michael Carotenuto said. However, this potential was immediately inhibited following Brooks injuring his hamstring last week. As a result, the Sun Devils could only muster up a measly 43 rushing yards on 29 carries against No. 13 Utah, unable to continue their momentum from the game against Washington State. Still, there are a lot of positives to look at for ASU. Outside of a 55-point beatdown against the Utes this past weekend, ASU has held up well against elite offenses. ASU s performance against theWashingtonis a prime example of how much ASU s defense has improved. Washington scores an average of nearly 42 points per game, but couldn t score a single touchdown against the Sun Devils. Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr., who is in the conversation to win the Heisman Trophy, had one of the worst performances of his career, with 275 passing yards and two interceptions. Shedeur Sanders was held to only 239 passing yards and the Buffaloes had to drive down the field in the final minutes to eke out the victory, serving as a testament to ASU s defense ability, according to Carotenuto. “Of course, there s not any moral victories, but to get that win last week against Washington State for homecoming, it s just huge piggybacking off how the defense played all year,” he said. The Sun Devils’ defensive performance against Washington has given them more recognition across the country. Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham stated that ASU has been playing some “pretty good defense” and noted that they were in the upper half of most defensive categories. READ MORE:How the little things became huge for Sun Devil football Brian Ward, the team s defensive coordinator, listed all the football players who were underrated this season. “B.J. Green already has more (sacks than he has had in his career through the first eight games,” Ward said. “Prince Dorbah, who played two years at Texas, was seldom used and didn t have a sack in two years and is now tied for the team lead in sacks.” Dorbah and defensive lineman Clayton Smith, who transferred from Oklahoma this past year and has two sacks in the last two games, shine as examples of players who were underutilized at their previous school but have made a significant impact when given an opportunity as Sun Devils. This shows promising talent at other schools that ASU is a place that will give them the chance to shine, boding well for ASU s recruitment process next year. This shows that despite many setbacks, ASU still puts up a good fight against strong opponents. All it needs is time to ripen its play. The fact that head coach Kenny Dillingham was already able to recruit a solid class in his first year on the job -- includingeight transferswho were 4-star prospects -- is a good sign for what s to come. From thebowl banat the beginning of the season, to the injuries, to a difficult schedule, ASU has fought an uphill battle all season long. The Sun Devils have had no stability this season, yet they have continued to look better as the season has progressed, pointing to Dillingham’s impact. We shouldn t base our perception of the football team solely on the final outcomes, but rather what s going on on the field and behind the scenes to set up the team for success. After all, it is always darkest before dawn, and every day the light grows brighter for the Sun Devils.

stanforddaily_2023_81,"Dear reader, When you hear the word “Stanford,” what comes to mind? You may think of Stanford’s cutting-edge research in fields like computer science or economics. But did you know that 50 years ago, the Stanford Research Institute (SRI was studyingpsychic activities? Although SRI formally split from Stanford University in 1970, it still used the Stanford name after its split. It’s hard to imagine a name now synonymous with world-class research attached to a topic that is at best taboo and at worst pseudoscientific. However, in 1972, SRI researchers Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff were determined to understand psychics and how they could leverage their mysterious powers. Oh, and did we mention that the CIA was in on the experiments too? Targ and Puthoff focused on one psychic in particular: Uri Geller. Originally from Israel, Geller had Targ, Puthoff and the CIAconvincedthat he had special, paranormal powers. One CIA document declared that as a result of Geller’s success in their experimental trials, Geller “demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner.” But not everyone was convinced by Geller’s psychic powers. Ray Hyman, a psychologist at the University of Oregon, was invited to investigate Geller and SRI’s study. Hyman concluded that Geller was a fraud with no real paranormal powers. But what Geller did have,accordingto Hyman, was the power to create an illusion using his skillful “public relations campaign.” This academic year was one marked by many moments of illusion and disillusion, from thefallof the cryptocurrency trading platform FTX to thestoryof Stanford imposter Will Curry. But what do we do once we fall under illusion or disillusion? The articles in this magazine explore just that. Sophia Artandi ’26 takes us through present and past issues surrounding speech and activism by faculty to explore how our perceptions and value judgments have changed over time. Staff writer Sarayu Pai ’23 explores the history and cultural impacts of novelist Ken Kesey and the band The Grateful Dead. News desk editor Oriana Riley ’25 talks to Stanford students about duck syndrome and how it persists despite most being aware of its existence. Arts and Life managing editor Sofia Gonzalez-Rodriguez ’25 and news desk editor Itzel Luna ’25 examine the future of CSRE programs. Staff writer Cameron Duran ’24 gives our brains a challenge in her “Spot the Difference” piece. Sebastian Hochman ’26 discusses how some disciplines are seen as hobbies at Stanford while others are seen as careers. Finally, Michelle Fu ’24, Kris Nino ’25 and Judy Liu ’26 share with us several pieces of fiction. We hope that the stories in this magazine inspire you to think about the illusions in your own life.

state_press_2023_23,"ASU junior guard DJ Horne (0 makes a move past an Arizona defender at T. Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nev. on Friday, March 10, 2023. Arizona beat ASU 78-59. The cracks in the existing name, image and likeness foundation at ASU is a major reason for the men s basketball s struggle to keep rising stars in Tempe. Guards freshmanAustin Nunezand juniorDJ Horne, as well as sophomore centerEnoch Boakye, have entered the transfer portal, but were expected to see expanded roles next season had they stayed with the Sun Devils. The loss of Horne and Nunez particularly hurts, as they contributed strongly to the team s success this year. NIL plays a big role, believe me, we ve lost guys to NIL, now the places that have had a serious, you know, commitment to that, things that we couldn t compete with, said basketball head coachBobby Hurleyat apress conferencefollowing his contract extension. But that doesn t mean we re not trying, Arizona State is trying, the Sun Angel Collective and stuff. The transfer situation could have been worse, but sophomore forwardJamiya Nealwithdrew from the transfer portal Monday afternoon to return to ASU, which is a key retention for Hurley s 2023-24 squad. A few years ago, it would be surprising to have young players leave a Power Five college basketball team the season after winning a game in the NCAA Tournament. But now, in the age of NIL deals, players are getting compensated for their talents. If a school and its community can t step up and compensate its players, those players have the incentive and ability to leave. At ASU, NIL benefits have seemed to be less than adequate. Even though two NIL collectives meant to support ASU athletes already existed, in February men s basketball players started their own NIL club. READ MORE:ASU men s basketball players debut new NIL Club ahead of critical end-of-season stretch Horne and Nunez were part ofthe club, which is self-described as an athlete-operated fan community that financially benefits Arizona State Men s Basketball Team athletes. At the time, Horne said the NIL club was to try to bring more attention to us as we re starting to near the end of the season. ASU athletes shouldn t have to start their own NIL collectives to compensate themselves, especially when already-established ASU NIL collectives exist. One of the established collectives, the Sun Angel Collective, accepts money from boosters and claimed to have raised $1 million when it launched in August 2022. A local bicycle dealership reportedly had trouble getting through to the collective, and men s basketball players also had trouble making initial contact with them. Brittani Willett, executive director of the Sun Angel Collective, said it had already made contact with the men s basketball team before she was hired in November. I haven t had specific conversations regarding why athletes are choosing to leave, but, you know, I d have to think NIL falls into that, but it s probably just one of other reasons, Willett said. ASU s NIL issues not only need to be solved, but reversed with strong NIL programs based on players wants that keep them in Tempe. The Sun Angel Collective is working to achieve that goal. Maybe where we re not able to be quite as competitive today, we re hoping that, we re building out something that s longer standing, Willett said. This isn t an impossible task. Schools like Arkansas, Oklahoma State, Ohio State and Boise State were each awarded for in-house NIL programs, with Boise State winning an award for the best institutional program in 2022. Mike Walsh, associate athletic director for strategic communications and business development at Boise State, said NIL is a factor for where athletes decide to play. It s another element (NIL to the decision-making process, just like location, major, facilities, coaches, teammates, conference … this is definitely another one that gets added to the list, Walsh said. READ MORE:Opinion: Crow s comments on Desert Financial Arena conditions reflect ASU facility neglect He said Boise State took an aggressive, hands-on approach to NIL. It seemed that ASU took a similar approach when it launchedits Spark NIL program, but clearly some dots aren t being connected for the men s basketball team, and it s costing the team talent and a chance to build off of a good season.

rice_thresher_2023_57,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/28/23 10:45pm During the Student Association senate meeting on Monday, Feb. 27, student leaders shot down a proposed resolution calling for the Faculty Senate to prohibit midterm exams or major assignments being scheduled during both the week of and after Beer Bike. Though we agree with the SA that this proposal is far too unrealistic to ever get through Faculty Senate, there is some merit in the intentions behind it. As part of the Rice community, faculty should understand the cultural significance of Beer Bike as the ultimate Rice tradition — for all of campus — and consider avoiding scheduling exams or major deadlines immediately after it. To be clear, we don’t believe the university can or should force faculty to change their syllabi around Beer Bike. However, we believe it’s in the best interest of students and faculty alike to consider the effect of student participation in Beer Bike. It is unreasonable to expect that this cultural event, that by its very nature includes large amounts of socializing and a disastrously little amount of sleep, won’t impair academic performances the following Monday. If the faculty’s ultimate goal is to help students learn, they should recognize that students likely won’t do their best work during this time, and having exams or important assignments due at the start of the following week sets students up for failure. We don’t see why professors cannot work around Beer Bike in their syllabi the same way they would (or are supposed to work around a midterm recess. With that in mind, we also strongly encourage Rice Program Council to decide on Beer Bike timing as early as possible, so that all of campus can prepare in the way we are asking them to. We know that the idea of academics being second to drinking and partying is unfathomable at an institution like Rice. But Beer Bike cannot be equated to deciding to grab a drink at Pub the night before an exam. The latter is pure irresponsibility on the students’ part, while the former is a campus event and tradition that not only enriches the Rice culture, but also expects the participation of all students. The possibility that any student might decide to miss out on this annual experience to not fail an exam or bomb a presentation is a shame that should be avoided at all costs. The idea behind Beer Bike is that literally everybody should participate. We believe faculty should recognize that by designing syllabi accordingly and, when that isn’t possible, be flexible in their deadlines.

Over the last 3 years the “C-12” committee composed of five students, five faculty and two administrators have worked tirelessly to study the Judicial Charter and Honor Code. The committee was given the explicit goal of finding a compromise among undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty. To that end, the C-12 conducted extensive outreach both inside and outside Stanford, and used that information to craft modest compromise proposals. Those proposals are true steps forward to improve academic integrity in the classroom and help students learn from their mistakes, rather than be unnecessarily punished. All stakeholder groups that have considered the proposals have adopted them, with one exception: the Undergraduate Senate, who rejected theHonor Code proposal. Undergraduate representatives told the Senate that students found a proposed study of proctoring unacceptable. Under the mutually agreed C-12 procedures, the Undergraduate Senate’s rejection of the C-12 proposal ended the C-12 process as regards the Honor Code, and placed the entire Stanford community at an impasse. The faculty want to work with students to improve academic integrity. However, the Undergraduate Senate’s rejection of the modest Honor Code proposal from the C-12 indicates that they fail to appreciate the dire state of academic honesty on campus and are refusing to compromise to improve the situation. The situation, both on and off campus, is dire, and with the advent of new technology can be expected to get worse. For instance, the Faculty Senate heard two weeks ago about a remote exam in a required CS class which turned out to be harder than expected, and where there isevidencethat 30-50% of the students cheated. It seems that as more students heard about the cheating, some felt they needed to do the same. This problem is not unique to Stanford. In exit surveys conducted by theHarvard Crimsonand theDaily Princetonian, approximately 20-30% of seniors at those institutions admit to having cheated. Whatever the reasons, the status quo is fundamentally incompatible with Stanford’s values and cannot be allowed to continue. This is a view widely held among the faculty: several of the faculty who voted against our motion to proctor exams agree that the current situation is unsustainable. Perhaps most troubling, our current policies and climate put honest students in an extremely difficult position: It is very hard to stand by your principles when you see classmates that cheat gain an advantage. To be clear, we are not blaming students for the current academic climate. The faculty have failed and we owe the students better. Proctoring is one step towards the faculty reclaiming our responsibilities. Of course, we don’t want to spend our time proctoring or engaging with time-consuming judicial proceedings. The view that ‘the Honor Code makes this the students’ problem’ has allowed the faculty to neglect our responsibilities for too long. All parts of our community must step up if we are to create a climate of true academic integrity. Breaking with 100 years of tradition was not a step taken lightly. But it is clear that the Faculty Senate was operating well within its authority and well within the spirit of earlier collaborations with students for shared academic integrity. The Honor Code was built on norms of students monitoring each other. For example, in 1955 the ASSU Honor Code Study Subcommittee made a powerfulstatementon the responsibility of students to monitor to ensure integrity. For whatever reason, this responsibility appears to have languished. According to theC-12 report, in the last 3 years only 2 of the 720 reports of Honor Code violations came directly from students. Of course some reports were made from students to instructors first, but it is hard to reconcile these numbers with any substantive level of student self-monitoring. We are told that the C-12’s outreach sessions confirmed that overwhelmingly students do not want to monitor each other. There was more consensus on this than on whether the faculty may or may not act as proctors. Allowing proctoring is certainly not the end of the story. As was discussed in the Faculty Senate, it seems likely that much cheating happens in settings other than in-class exams. We have much more to do. Whether they choose to let the proctoring proceed in the Autumn or prefer to return to the study of proctoring proposed by the C-12, we urge the undergraduate leadership to engage with the problem of academic integrity, as the student representatives on C-12 did so effectively. What ideas do the students have to prevent cheating? What affirmative steps forward do the students want to take? Students are probably best placed to come up with practical and effective strategies, in what must surely be our shared interest in ensuring academic integrity at Stanford.

crimson_2023_58,"The Harvard Law Review is one of the oldest and most widely cited legal journals in the country. I participated in the grueling endeavor of the six-day writing competition to join the Law Review, like many other first-year law students, because of the chance to engage with emerging literature by leading legal scholars. As a student interested in human rights and humanitarian law, I knew there would be few opportunities to publish international scholarship within the journal due to its generalist nature. And yet, I never could have imagined that during my tenure as an editor of the Law Review, I would have to argue that international law is real, that atrocities are occurring in Palestine — as they had occurred in Israel — and that truly “reviewing” the law requires engaging scholars from diverse backgrounds with uncomfortable perspectives. All of this came to a head last month when the Harvard Law Review solicited and subsequently voted to reject publication of “The Ongoing Nakba” by Rabea Eghbariah. The decision to silence Eghbariah has called into question our commitment to academic freedom, and has made us complicit in thecontinued silencingof Palestinian activists and scholars across the country. The Harvard Law Review must correct this harm, or forever bear the legacy of silence in the face of grave injustice. Thedecision to quash“The Ongoing Nakba” came in the form of a collective revocation vote, a deviation from the standard procedure for blog posts. Though the piece was solicited, edited, and approved through the usual process, its publication was delayed and eventually rescinded by a nearly six-hour emergency meeting of the full editorial body — a practice that to manycurrent editors’ knowledge, had never occurred for a solicited piece. In considering publication, editors’ concerns ranged from fear of public backlash to more disconcerting criticism of the substantive claims of the piece. During our lengthy deliberations, I couldn’t help but wonder, were objections to the article genuinely based on worries about factual mischaracterization? Or rather, were they grounded in fear of what the piece argues: that when it comes to Palestine, no number of citations are enough to prove violations of international law. In the days after we reversed course, it became obvious to me that the Harvard Law Review had joined many other students, academics, and journalists across the United States, acquiescing to thePalestine exceptionto free speech. For what seems like fear of losing their clerkships or big law jobs, my peers, who normally supported academic freedom and human rights, found themselves voting contrary to these principles. The Palestine exception is destructive, it chills speech and progress, and it is now clear that it has reached one of the highest ivory towers in the United States. Ironically, by failing to publish this article, we have affirmed its trenchant observation that lawyers “tend to sharpen their pens after the smell of death has dissipated.” As a first generation, low-income student, participating in the Law Review has been one of the greatest achievements of my academic career. Now, it is those characteristics, along with my commitment to international law and academic freedom, which compel me to call on the Harvard Law Review to correct this institutional failure. The Law Review should take two important steps to make amends for this injustice. First, it must release a public apology to Rabea Eghbariah for discriminatory treatment and inadequate engagement with his article. Second, the Law Review should publish a piece describing the legal framework of abuses against Palestinians in the occupied territories. I hope these suggestions are taken in good faith, for the betterment of a journal that aims to be academically rigorous. More broadly, across academia, we can no longer prioritize individual accomplishment over a genuine commitment to critically interrogating the truth within the framework of the law. The Law Review spoke as an institution to reject Eghbariah’s article. That is the truth of the matter, and we participated in a democratic vote to uncover that unfortunate truth. However in the extraordinary process of revoking publication of this piece, which would have been the first ever written by a Palestinian author in the Law Review, there is another truth: that there can be no “reviewing” of the law within an editorial framework that silences warnings of genocide, and indeed Nakba.

crimson_2023_23,"This summer,news brokethat Harvard Business School found Professor Francesca Gino guilty of research misconduct. The school placed her on unpaid administrative leave, terminated her family’s health benefits, and stripped her of her endowed faculty title. As her peers and fellow tenured faculty, we assumed this outcome resulted from a fair investigative process by the Business School, because as an institution we have always believed that process integrity is the foundation of outcome integrity. But what we’ve learned since then has rocked our confidence in HBS — enough so that seven of us feel compelled to speak out, and must do so anonymously for fear of retaliation from the institution whose principles we hold so dear. First, despite having a Research Integrity Policy in place for years, HBSopted to change that policy. By only doing so after receiving allegations regarding Gino’s work, HBS violated its norms of policy development. In the past, new policies governing faculty have been developed with extensive faculty input. Often, this begins with the announcement of a task force to lead the effort, followed by small-group discussions, interviews, and surveys among faculty members. The task force then develops a recommendation which is presented and voted upon at a subsequent faculty meeting before being formally adopted by the Business School administration. This process typically takes several months. Instead of following this well-trodden path, HBS quietly created and rolled out a new interim policy for research misconduct in the summer of 2021. This policy was in place for two years before ever being mentioned to faculty. The new policy appears to have been designed specifically for Gino. It created artificial and arbitrary restrictions that limited her ability to defend herself. For example, the old policy permitted those under investigation to discuss the matter with advisors and others as needed. The new policy limited Gino to talking with two advisors and forbade her from talking to people outside the investigative process under threat of termination for violating confidentiality. Furthermore, HBS had faculty and staff working on the investigation for months, including the assistance of an outside forensics firm. Gino had just a few weeks to respond to their voluminous reports while also carrying a full teaching load. Second, it appears HBS did not follow its own interim policy. Here are the most troubling ways this happened, according to Gino’s lawsuit complaint: HBS never articulated its specific charge of research misconduct, unfairly shifted the burden of proof onto Gino, failed to maintain confidentiality, and recommended the harshest possible sanctions without considering mitigating circumstances. Third, the University’s Third Statute — which concerns “Officers and Staff of the University” — requires a finding of “grave misconduct” for a tenured professor’s removal from teaching and administrative positions. By placing her on a two-year unpaid administrative leave absent such a finding, HBS effectively terminated Gino’s employment while circumventing the procedural protections she is entitled to under her contract and longstanding University policies. Fourth, we understand that Dean Srikant M. Datar requested the Office of the President formally review Gino’s tenure. Harvardhas not fired any tenured professorssince the formalization of tenure rules in the 1940s — including professors accused of sexual misconduct, sexual assault, and Title IX violations, who Harvard allowed to either retire or return to teaching. We believe Gino’s charges pale in comparison to some of these horrors. Furthermore, given the broken investigation process, we are concerned about this drastic step setting a precedent for other faculty down the line. We are speaking out today because Dean Datar has a responsibility to HBS faculty to explain the changes he made to the research integrity process. We are not asking for details of the lawsuit or Harvard’s litigation strategy. Our focus is institutional process and integrity, ensuring each of us are treated fairly and equally with procedures that reflect what HBS stands for. Questions that need answers include: Why the need for a new policy if the old policy was explicit about data falsification? Was there an agreement with the academic bloggers at Data Colada that motivated this change, as Gino’s lawsuit alleges, and if so, what was the agreement? Why was the new policy not inclusive of faculty involvement, nor communicated explicitly to faculty? Is it true that Dean Datar has counseled faculty facing public scrutiny to resign in the past, and if so, is Gino’s lawsuit correct that this treatment has been disproportionately applied to female faculty? As tenured HBS faculty, we never imagined we’d need to speak out anonymously about our own institution. But our questions demand answers, and for the protection of ourselves, our colleagues, and our principles, we have been left with no other choice.

crimson_2023_167,"It’s Tuesday night. I try to eat in Winthrop House with a friend from Currier House. But, as he swipes his ID and is granted access to the dining hall of his sister House, the guardian device rejects me with a red flash. “Which House are you in?” “Pforzheimer House,” I reply meekly. “Then you can’t eat here tonight — try Adams House instead.” If you visit theHarvard University Dining Services website, you will be treated to a vast, byzantine matrix of dining restrictions based on House affiliation, the rows and columns barring any visitors to each River House at least one night out of the week. Some of these restrictions are downright inscrutable to anyone who has not chosen to memorize the “Hours & Interhouse Restrictions” webpage. For instance, Dunster House: “M-W, 1 interhouse guest with resident only from 6-7:15, Dunster+Athletes in season 7:15-8:30”; “Th, Community Night until 7:15 (Dunster only , Dunster+Athletes 7:15-8:30.” Huh? In restricting dining to House residents,weekly “Community Nights”and other mealtime restrictions split apart friends who, by the luck of the draw, reside in different Houses. Broader campus cohesion is sacrificed to the altar of a narrower House community. These restrictions need to go. This level of micromanagement of student dining is not only inconvenient, but entirely at odds with the goal of fostering community on campus. “Let’s grab a meal sometime” may be the most vacuous phrase at Harvard — more a polite goodbye than an actual invitation. But the cliche betrays a nugget of truth: Campus social life revolves around dining together. Perhaps more than anywhere else, community is built over a plate of red spiced chicken or beef fajita fettuccine. This reality makes abolishing interhouse restrictions far from a trivial goal. Don’t get me wrong: The residential House system is a positive quirk of Harvard life. Community based on a shared pride of place and frequent serendipitous encounters — however arbitrary its randomized algorithm-forged outer bounds might be — is a wonderful part of the social tapestry of this University. However, walled-off dining halls are not the manner in which we should attempt to generate House camaraderie. If someone doesn’t want to dine with their mostly unchosen housemates, they should not be forced to. Interhouse barriers unnecessarily restrict choice — undermining instead of meaningfully contributing to campus community. As a beneficiary (and sometimes victim of the Quad-River sister House system, I do not feel that Harvard is fostering community when I am sent, alone, to Adams on a Thursday night, while friends from Currier can sit down in Winthrop. The maze of restrictions unfairly disadvantages those with a wider net of friends outside their House than inside it — especially as within-House friends will choose to dine as a group on Community Nights anyway. The sister House system proves that Harvard understands that student convenience — in this case, for Quad residents spending dinner hours on the River — sometimes justifies mixing residents of different Houses even during restricted dining hours. We need to extend that logic. Indeed, outside of avoiding overcrowded dining halls at peak hours — which can be achieved by capping, instead of outright banning, interhouse dining — no argument in favor of dining restrictions holds water. Annenberg Hall — that melting pot that forged so many of our lasting friendships — is the perfect model for dining at Harvard. Let students make their own decisions about when and where to dine — and whom to dine with. Let the beautiful, chaotic web of our social life fully flourish during mealtimes. Sam E.

We write to you as Stanford Jewish alumni who have been closely monitoring with great concern the discourse on campus regarding Hamas’ terror attack of Oct. 7 and Israel’s military response to those atrocities. We write to ensure you know that, as Jews who are part of the Stanford family, we stand in solidarity with you in these challenging times. As Stanford students, you should be able to count on finding supportive learning and living environments that prioritize your physical safety and mental well-being. If you choose to, you should be able to identify proudly as Jewish on campus, in class and in your dorms and houses. You should have the right, if you wish to exercise it, to engage in civil discussion about Hamas’ atrocities, Israel’s response to them, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or Israel’s existence in general without fear of physical harm, antisemitic insults, bullying, dehumanization and social ostracization, whether from fellow students, faculty or staff. Stanford should be a place where all students — Jewish, Muslim, Christian or any group — are able to experience kindness, compassion, respect and understanding that we should all expect of one another. Where Stanford’s policies on campus discourse and its regulation of speech on campus fail to reflect these principles — or are applied inconsistently or unfairly — then they should be changed. Where Stanford fails to provide you with the resources you need to be safe from intimidation, threats and bullying, or to help you cope with what we can only imagine is an extremely difficult time to be Jewish on campus, then the University must act to ensure that Stanford remains a place where you can learn, grow and experience all that Stanford has to offer. Please know that many of us have already communicated our disappointment to the administration and that we will continue using our voices as alumni to advocate for you as Stanford students. In the days and weeks ahead, we encourage you to seek community or other support networks you want and need, whether that be through the Jewish (Hillel and Chabad , University (Office of Religious and Spiritual Life and/or other resources on or off campus. You can also reach out to the Stanford Jewish Alumni Network if connecting with Jewish alumni might prove beneficial. Wherever you turn, please know that we have your back, will remain vigilant and will continue to monitor the campus conversation, in the hope and expectation that, in time, you are again comfortable calling Stanford your home away from home. We are circulating this letter more broadly and expect the list of signatories to grow. We pray that you will find comfort and support as you deal with the horrific atrocities of Oct. 7 and all the events that have followed, including on our campus. As you find your own path forward, know that you are not only in our prayers, but also at the top of our minds.

crimson_2023_74,"“Concern for man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors,” Albert Einstein professed to students at the California Institute of Technology in a1931 speech. “Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations.” Almost a century later, most scientists carry out research according to this standard — but some do, in fact, forget his warning. Scientists have a unique power to unveil the deepest truths about our physical and natural world. They hold up mirrors to our societies and challenge the status quo of accepted thought. The profession holds immense beauty and influence, but also immense responsibility. In the world of academic research, the only goal should be to obtain truth — we should never let honesty fall second to the pursuit of personal gain. A recent high-profile integrity case in scientific misconduct has struck a tension with this standard. Just over three weeks ago, The Crimson reported that neuroscientist and Stanford President Marc T. Tessier-Lavigne will beinvestigated by a team of top researchersin his field, including former Harvard provost Steven E. Hyman. Tessier-Lavigne is accused of co-authoring papers with doctored images and figures spanning multiple years, including one in thejournal Celland two inScience. According to theStanford Daily’sNov. 2022 reporting, Stanford claimed that Tessier-Lavigne had attempted to correct any research misconduct after he was first informed of the accusations in 2015 and that the images did not affect the papers’ findings. However, some experts argue that the image manipulation of which Tessier-Lavigne is accused suggests intent to mislead readers — which, if true, would constitute a severe act of academic wrongdoing. Researchers gain a lot with each successful publication, including increased funding and citations that boost their reputation and status. For honest research findings, such accolades are well-deserved; scientific research is a laborious and intensely challenging process. Rewarding notable scientific progress through publication and career advancement is crucial to advance knowledge. However, this system also creates significant institutional pressure on academics to produce consistent, impactful results. As such, there exists a rare but exceedingly damaging type of academic who will falsify findings for personal gain during their career, putting self-interest over truth — at a high cost to the greater scientific community. If Tessier-Lavigne is found guilty of scientific misconduct, his current status as the president of a prestigious university and a renowned scholar could be partially attributed to obstructions of truth. Any mishandling of misconduct cases such as this could have immeasurable consequences, the most concerning being a jeopardization of public trust in science. In a time where public skepticism of scientists is growing, it could not be more vital for every scientist to uphold integrity. This is especially true for high-profile scientists and researchers in positions of authority. In December 2021, only 29 percent ofsurveyed adultsin the United States had a “great deal of confidence in medical scientists to act in the best interests of the public,” declining approximately 10 percentage points compared to the prior year — a trend seen across all scientists, not just those in medical research. Vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, climate change denialism, and pandemic skepticism are all examples of this trend, with serious consequences for public health and policy. Every researcher must prioritize public trust in science as a core foundation to their work; failures of integrity only further threaten public confidence. Training in scientific integrity must be strengthened, both by teaching young scientists to maintain credible research practices and by training all researchers to identify and report scientific misconduct. For the concerned reader, you should know that it is not easy for falsified data to make it to a published journal in the first place. Every published paper, including each paper co-authored by Tessier-Lavigne that is currently under fire, is peer-reviewed by experts, who may provide extensive feedback, requests for revision, or even full rejection. However, it is still possible for some integrity cases to fall through the cracks, especially if the submitting authors are well-respected in their field. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have already been shown as havingpotential to assist peer review; these technologies could be further employed in practice to review data and flag potential figure manipulation during the review process. Yet no matter what changes are made to the review process, it will always be the responsibility of publishing scientists to uphold truth and honesty in their work. To those of my peers who dream of chasing scientific discovery, remember that integrity should be valued above all else. Even to those who do not envision a career in traditional scientific research, you too bear equal responsibility to work honestly. These principles are needed in everyday life, in every job you will ever hold, and in every sector of our society. Anyone who has the power to inform has the equal power to deceive. I ask that you wield your influence with the sole intention of illuminating the truths about our beautifully complex world, for a purpose greater than yourself alone. Eleanor P. Wiesler ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is an Applied Mathematics concentrator in Eliot House."
ubyssey_2023_2,"Nov. 27, 2023 Written byVancouver Chapter of Independent Jewish Voices Independent Jewish Voices (IJV is offended by anew lawsuitfiled against the UBC administration and the AMS. based on spurious charges of antisemitism at UBC. Unfortunately, this is merely the latest instance of the weaponizing of antisemitism against those who defend Palestinian human rights or criticize the actions and policies of the State of Israel. This malicious tactic should be rejected out of hand. In addition to infringing on legitimate freedom of expression and academic freedom enjoyed by members of the academic community, such legal actions and other, similarly inspired efforts serve to weaken the battle that must be waged against real antisemitism. We believe that their purpose is the suppression of campus activism for Palestinian human rights in response to the ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people at the hands of the State of Israel. The case was filed in the name of John and Jane Doe. John and Janepresent three examplesof what they deem to be manifestations of antisemitism: In 2018, two social justice groups at UBCposted a link to an article on Facebook. Jewish groups on campus responded, telling them that the article they shared was antisemitic. The social justice groups immediately investigated and apologized. In 2021, someoneripped down a student’s mezuzah(a Jewish religious symbol that is mounted on doorways in a UBC residence. This may also have occurred a second time. It is not clear whether this was an antisemitic incident or an instance of simple mischief. In 2022, a UBC departmentsponsored a speakerwho was employed as a federal government antiracist consultant. After the speech at UBC he was found to have made tweets which some considered antisemitic. The example chosen by John and Jane to illustrate this antisemitism was the consultant’s reference to Israel as the “Zionist apartheid regime.” These are their only specific accusations. John and Jane go on to make general, unsubstantiated statements about difficulties that Jewish students allegedly have encountered when discussing the Middle East in classes, how they have been made to feel uncomfortable on campus, etc. What Jane and John Doe have done is to conflate criticism of Israel, its policies, its government and its military actions, with antisemitism. We have every confidence that the courts will understand John and Jane Does’ filing for what it is: a political diatribe masquerading as a lawsuit. The antisemitism that exists in Canada today is largely practiced by white supremacists and far-right fringe groups. It is not tolerated by the rest of society, and certainly not at UBC. Unfortunately, Israel and its defenders have responded to the growing support for the Palestinian cause by mislabeling criticism of Israel and its actions as antisemitism. This strategy culminated in the issuing of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA definition of antisemitism, which focuses overwhelmingly on criticisms of Israel. The goal of those who promote the IHRA definition is to have Palestine solidarity activities condemned as manifestations of antisemitism and to subject those who engage in them to legal and other sanctions. John and Jane’s lawsuit is driven by the same purpose. In 1948, 750,000 Palestinians were driven out of their homesin Palestine as part of the creation of the state of Israel. The subsequent oppression of the Palestinians, who had nothing to do with antisemitism,continues today. Yet in a grotesque misuse of the term, Palestinian activists are regularly branded as antisemites when they resistIsraeli occupation and apartheid. John and Jane’s lawsuit is part of the effort to weaponize antisemitism against a colonized people and those who support their resistance against oppression and occupation. We believe that the true source of John and Jane Doe’s objections is rooted in their concern that members of the UBC community are increasingly learning about, understanding and appreciating Israel’s settler-colonial history as well as the apartheid system that exists in Israel today. As knowledge of the realities of Palestinian life in Israel and the occupied territories grows, so does support for the Palestinian cause. By launching frivolous claims of discrimination, conflating antisemitism with criticism of Israel and demanding investigations and procedures to root out specious instances of antisemitism, John and Jane are seeking to suppress legitimate debate on this topic. True antisemitism — the hatred of Jewish people for being Jewish — is abhorrent. Extending this label to members of the UBC community engaged in discussing the history and contemporary reality in Israel and Palestine is as well. People like John and Jane count on using this accusation to suppress legitimate speech and political activity that scrutinizes Israeli treatment of Palestinians. Ultimately, their goal is to intimidate and silence those with whom they disagree. John and Jane purport to represent all Jewish students who have attended UBC since 1998, including students who are currently enrolled. This is clearly not the case. Like the members of all communities, Jews at UBC hold different views on a range of subjects, including on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. By filing a class action in the name of all of the Jewish students who have attended UBC since 1998, John and Jane suggest that all Jews at UBC share their unquestioning support for the state of Israel and its ongoing occupation of Palestine. But many Jewish students at UBC, including those who are members of Independent Jewish Voices, reject their misapplication of the term antisemitism and support the right of everyone to engage in robust discussion and debate on the subject of Israeli colonialism and apartheid. John and Jane Doe contend that Jewish students feel threatened, uncomfortable and targeted because of what they label as “hate speech” on campus. No one should be unsafe at UBC. But being made to feel uncomfortable by the expression of ideas you disagree with is not the same as being threatened. Engaging in rigorous, spirited debate within the UBC community about moral and political issues does not constitute abuse. Students who have applauded Israel’s actions in Gaza should not be surprised to be called out by others who are appalled by the horrific slaughter of Palestinian civilians that has occurred there over the past six weeks. Those who share and express John and Jane’s views are not being challenged for their Jewishness. They are being called out for their support of violence, military invasion, and the targeting of Palestinian civilians. While IJV condemns all instances where anyone is made to feel unsafe because they are a member of a particular cultural, ethnic or religious group, it has been our experience that the Palestine Solidarity Movement goes out of its way to condemn all instances of such behaviour, including manifestations of antisemitism. Similarly frivolous yet disturbing lawsuits to the one initiated by John and Jane have been initiated against other Canadian universities, including McGill, the University of Toronto and York. We are confident those will have as little success as the one filed against UBC. Share this articlecopied!

ubyssey_2023_30,"March 24, 2023 Written byEitan Feiger Food insecurity is a growing problem on campus. TheAMS Food Banksaw a600-visit spikein the past year. Around “40 per centof undergraduate students and 50 per cent of graduate students said they were worried about running out of food at least once in the past 12 months,” according to the 2022 AMS Academic Experience Survey. In anopen letterto the UBC Board of Governors, Sprouts highlighted how “d espite UBC’s self-proclaimed dedication to reconciliation and equity, they perpetuate food insecurity whichdisproportionately affectsBlack, Indigenous, racialized, immigrant, low-income, houseless, and/or disabled UBC community members.” However, Jewish students are also an underrepresented minority group that is subject to this inequity. Keepingkosherhas been one of my greatest personal, physical and spiritual challenges so far in my life. Finding meals on campus that nourish myself and that are within the dietary restrictions ofkashrut, all while staying true to myfaithand not compromising myvalues, has been an uphill battle. As one representing hundreds of Jewish UBC students, I believe there needs to be more access to kosher food on campus. In Hebrew, the word “kosher” means “fit” or “acceptable,” according tohalakha,which is Jewish law. Any food grown from the Earth is naturally kosher. However, any food that has been processed and prepared by humans must be carefully supervised by an Orthodox Rabbi. You can think of keeping kosher as a form of hygiene. The facility, the kitchen and production line in which a product is manufactured, processed and prepared must be kept very clean — undergoing frequent checks by an Orthodox Rabbi — and must avoid cross-contamination withnon-kosher food(like pork and shellfish , all with zero signs of any animal infestations (likerats . In Jewish tradition,mixing milk (representing life with meat (representing death is another big no-no. For example, I cannot eat a cheeseburger or order a meal at a cafe which cross-contaminates dairy utensils with meat utensils. So even a restaurant that advertises as 100 per cent vegetarian or vegan is not officially kosher until it strictly meets the dietary, hygienic and/or rabbinical supervision requirements above. Many vendors throughout campus incidentally sell kosher, pre-packaged snacks with ahekhsher, an official certification by an Orthodox Rabbi approving a product as kosher. Although pre-packaged snacks are available, they do not constitute a sufficient meal on their own. There needs to be fresh kosher meals that are healthy, ready-made and affordable. Since last summer, I have been doggedly persistent at trying to improve vendor availability of kosher food at UBC. I had been in correspondence with UBCHillel BC,Chabad Jewish Student Centre,UBC Food ServicesandUBC s VP Finance and Operationsteam toarrange a supplier setup and establish “requestor” contact on campus, along with a potential supplier such as the veganKosher Experiencefood truck. But UBC’s bureaucratic system has delayed this process indefinitely. Kosher food has the potential not only to serve Jewish students, but vegan, vegetarian and Muslim students as well. While UBC food security initiatives like theUBC Meal Share program,AMS Food Bank,Sprouts,Acadia Food Hub,Agora Café, and theResidencemeal plans (which has provided some kosher meals since 2020 and can be requested in advance, but is only available at designated times for students living in select residences offer nutritional support for students facing food insecurity, none of them provide kosher-certified meals from a kosher-certified kitchen. For example, the dining halls collaborate with UBC Chabad “to provide support and consultation on Kosher food availability at UBC,” but they do not provide kosher-certified meals from a kosher-certified kitchen, according to a statement. Regarding the plethora of options above tackling food insecurity, one UBC studentremarked, “I really like the diversity that the market offers. When I was walking by, you can see a lot of different ethnic foods, a lot of foods that people would enjoy.” Yet, the diversity of food options (such asHalal and the accommodation of dietary needs (such as gluten-free foods at UBC happens to include everything except kosher-certified meals. Or namely, it excludes Jewish students. For many Jewish students applying to university, kosher food isthedeciding factor in their enrollment. If other top Canadian universities, such as theUniversity of TorontoorMcGill University, offer access to kosher food, then why can’t UBC? In my personal experience living off campus, there are some days where I wake up late, rush out the door with no meal, and, with no access to kosher-certified meals on campus, go hungry throughout the day. I am tired of it. With UBC’s recentapproval of allocating $500k toward food security programsand the AMS’s recentlaunch of their food security initiative, the AMS Food Bank can establish a contract with the leading Orthodox kosher certification organization in British ColumbiaKosher Checkto supervise the preparation of kosher meals (such as falafel and sandwich wraps in the facilities of the AMS Food Bank. While establishing and maintaining a kosher kitchen may not be feasible, having access in the Nest to a microwave, refrigerator and a dry goods rack designatedonlyfor kosher-certified meals would be the first most practical action to take. I stand tall and proud to share my identity with others on campus. But, if there is not even any access to kosher-certified meals on campus, it furthers the marginalization of Jewish students like myself. If the AMS and the UBC is committed to equity, diversity and inclusion, then they must commit to making kosher-certified meals accessible on campus.

crimson_2023_130,"When I returned to Harvard from spring break, laundry was the last thing on my mind. My flights had been delayed by almost eight hours, causing me to arrive in my dorm at 1 a.m. on Monday morning, with class in eight hours. Unsurprisingly, I hadn’t started any of the work that I had promised myself I would do over the break. And I was still covered in sand from playing touch rugby on the beach in Bermuda the day before. Yet as I unpacked, the smell of a week’s worth of dirty clothes soon forced laundry to the front of my priorities. So with my dirties in one hand and Tide pods in the other, off to the machines in the middle of the night I went. Again. But as I rounded the corner into the Weld Hall laundry room, I was greeted by those four letters that put all college students into a state of pure ecstasy: F-R-E-E. Maybe it was the sleep deprivation, or maybe I really do hate paying for laundry that much. But those four letters sent me over the moon. Unburdened by cost, I separated my laundry into three loads instead of shoving it all into one machine and pouring a detergent libation to the laundry gods. I even stripped my bed and washed my sheets just because it was free. As far as I was concerned, this was a new era. Harvard had reinvented itself while I was gone. Paying for laundry was a thing of the past. How disappointed I was when I came back a week later, also past midnight, and found that laundry was once again $3 — $1.50 to wash, $1.50 to dry. There I was, saying another prayer to the Tide pod gods, hoping that one machine could fit all of my dirty clothes. Throughout this veritable roller coaster of emotions, I was left with one burning question: Why does Harvard, one of the richest universities on the planet, charge its students $3 for a load of laundry? Assuming that there are 16 weeks in a full semester, and all 7,103 current Harvard College students do two loads of laundry totalling $6 a week, Harvard is only raking in $681,888 of revenue per semester. And while the word “only” used next to a six-figure number might seem a little absurd, that yearly figure is only about 0.17 percent of the University’s total $406 million budget surplus last fiscal year. It’s not that I expect Harvard to cover every possible expense that it can afford, but the real absurdity to me is Harvard’s hesitancy to offer free laundry when doing so would bring tangible, significant benefits to every single student. With free laundry, students would be less likely to overfill the machines, which is good for both them and Harvard. When students do all of their laundry in one load, clothes are not totally clean, negatively impacting the student and their clothes. And unsurprisingly, overfilling of machines is a leading cause of damage to washing machines. By switching to free laundry, Harvard is actually likely to save money on machine repair. Free laundry would also keep us healthier. Dirty clothes, bedding, and towels are all huge vectors for disease, and removing cost gives students no reason to delay washing their dirty sheets and towels until they can put together one large load. Free laundry would encourage students to wash as frequently as they need, preventing the spread of more germs on campus. Granting students free laundry would also remove a legitimate — and regressive — financial burden. While tuition, housing, and food can all be covered with financial aid, laundry is funded by Crimson Cash — a fully out-of-pocket payment account for students — or quarters. And the larger the financial constraint that laundry has on students, the more likely they are to overfill machines and delay washing altogether, perpetuating the above problems. Harvard is behind the pack when it comes to free laundry. Half of the Ivy League — Princeton, Penn, Columbia, and Brown — currently offer this basic amenity to their students, and students are calling for free or more affordable laundry at Yale and Dartmouth, too. Harvard should lead among its peers — or at least join them. Clean clothes are a basic necessity, yet Harvard does not see them as such. When students are discouraged from doing their laundry by unnecessary financial barriers, washing machines wear out faster, students get sicker, and campus becomes less pleasant overall. As it showed the week after spring break, Harvard has the ability to make our laundry free. So why doesn’t it? Mac M. Mertens ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Weld Hall."
wildcat_arizona_2023_16,"Local Tucson band The Basements perform live. After taking some time to listen and reach out to local bands in the Tucson area, I found that the music scene was truly worthwhile. From the five bands I interviewed, I found a sense of hopefulness and understanding — a community that is not only working to bring Tucsonans together, especially Tucson youth, but also working towards building a strong connection amongst each other as musicians. Here are five local bands that students and all Tucson residents need to listen to in 2023. Annie Jump Cannon “Our mom was cool with it, so we just set up in the house and invited a bunch of friends over, so that’s really where it started — in our house, in our living room,” said Logan Membrila when asked about how Annie Jump Cannon began. The local band is comprised of 4 members — Logan Membrila is the backing vocalist and bassist, Rory Membrila is the lead singer and guitarist, Jake Cowen is the drummer and Ian Starks is the lead guitarist. Logan shares that he and sibling Rory “started playing music together at a pretty young age. I think that we grew up around a lot of music in our family and it led us to getting introduced into the rock scene.” Now they have a thriving album that was released recently in 2022 titledFlourishing Apart.The band traveled to New Jersey in October 2020 to record the album with No Sleep Records. Both the band’s favorite, my favorite and one of their most well-known songs on the album is “Strawberry Fiona.” Rory relayed to me that the song was originally not supposed to be onFlourishing Apartbut it ended up being one of their most played songs from the album. “Strawberry Fiona” started with Rory creating a “slow, sweet acoustic song,” which they reworked by adding new verses to make it more upbeat. If you want to hear “Strawberry Fiona” or any music fromFlourishing Apartor other music by Annie Jump Cannon you can find them onInstagram@anniejumpcannon_ and most streaming platforms. Their next upcoming show is at theGroundworksin Tucson on Feb. 23 at 7 p.m. New Misphoria Lee Parada is the singer and guitarist and Bella Crump is the drummer of the local band New Misphoria. Although they are only a two-member band, they are able to effectively convey a powerful message through their music. “You need to accept your sadness … that’s what New Misphoria’s music does in every single song,” Crump said. Parada and Crump both use music as an outlet to communicate their thoughts and feelings in a healthy way and then encourage that behavior in their listeners and audience. “I think that we as the musicians are the ones who basically control the perceived importance that comes from the music. So I am excited that we generally promote a good message,” Parada said. Their new singles “Chocolate Fondant” and “Reflective Skin” illustrate the positivity they are trying to bring into the music environment by emphasizing the importance of accepting your emotions in a way that is beneficial to you. “Being really pissed off, but being able to communicate it in a way that’s healthy,” Parada explained is what they do best. Check out “Chocolate Fondant” and “Reflective Skin” on all streaming platforms, and if you want to learn more about New Misphoria and their upcoming projects and shows you can find them onInstagram@newmisphoria. Coffin Hotbox Daniel Knight, the rhythm guitarist and singer of Coffin Hotbox, states that the band members, “try to keep our music open and not too predictable.” The band consists of Knight, Andrew Weesner the lead guitarist, Max Michaud the drummer, Shane Harkins the bassist and Dennett Brown the lead singer. Their music is far from predictable and I found that what they create explores many different deep topics including experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, encountering poverty and feeling the emotions of eco-anxiety because of the global climate crisis. “The song ‘Second Wave Surf’ on our live album is one I wrote about my experience during the heights of the pandemic, hence second wave. It was one of the lowest points in my life and not just because my family totally locked down and stopped doing really any social activities but also because I was super broke at the time,” Knight said. The members of Coffin Hotbox find that it is crucial to speak upon the issues that matter most to them. “I know some people will be upset that this song is somewhat political but these are just things happening in our lives that will have a huge impact on what our world ends up looking like,” Knight said. To find out more about Coffin Hotbox you can find them onInstagram@coffinhotbox and most streaming platforms. Their next show is on Feb. 17 at theHouse of Bards. The Basements On Jan. 28, The Basements opened with their new single “Changes (stay the same ” at191 Toolein Tucson. Sebastian Driver, the singer and guitarist; Brandon Pors, the lead guitarist; Dylan Goode, the bassist and Alex Sciortino, the drummer drew a large crowd to the local venue that Saturday night. The song “Changes (stay the same ” is, “about things that tend to stay the same even though everything is changing around you,” Driver informed. The band began in Goode’s basement during the COVID-19 pandemic and has since released their first extended play, “Long Stories Get Short.” They have performed at theDUSKMusic Festival and have played at several local venues within the Tucson community and elsewhere. “We are amazed by how supportive of a community Tucson is for local artists, and have tons of gratitude for all the people that have helped us along our journey,” Goode said. The Basements are ecstatic to continue performing throughout Arizona and revealed that they have many exciting opportunities coming up in the next few months. Their next show will be at TheNile Theateron Feb. 10 at 7 p.m. Goode joked that for people who want to see them live, he hopes they acquire, “permanent hearing damage, the urge to dance, and are inspired to be themselves and do what they want.” To learn more about The Basements you can find them onInstagram@thebasementsmusic,TikTokand most streaming platforms. The Sinks The Sinks is a four-member band consisting of Jackson Kimball, the singer and guitarist; Gabriel Noriega, the bassist; Harrison Cable, the drummer and Aidan Ochoa, the guitarist. Kimball, Noriega and Cable have known each other since middle school. They decided in high school they wanted to start a band. “We started playing some jazz together at Tucson High, but we decided we wanted to play rock music,” Cable said. Kimball joked that, “Back then we all played bass, but we kind of switched to guitar and drums. We realized we couldn’t have three bass players in a band.” They mainly focus on creating alternative rock music but have since been trying to incorporate country western influences into the music they play. The members of the band explained that they love to go heavy on the guitar — attempting to build it up and break it down throughout their songs. “If we make a really good song, we want people to lose their minds over it,” Cable said. More information about upcoming shows and music can be found on theirInstagram@thesinksband andYouTube. Many of these bands put on live performances throughout Tucson. All of us, but especially the younger generation have undergone devastating impacts from growing up during the COVID-19 pandemic and being secluded from live social activities. Parada from New Misphoria relates to a lot of what we are feeling right now. “After this pandemic, it’s so hard to navigate everything … the way that we are so consumed with being online, it’s hard to connect with people your own age in person,” they expressed. Now with the return of live music, it is important to encourage ourselves and others to get involved to build up our Tucson community and connect with others in person again.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2023_1,"Editor’s Note: This writer is a New University staff member who is involved in the University of California Student Association (UCSA . Being a disabled student at UC Irvine has given me a unique perspective on what the UC system can do to better provide for students with disabilities. I was invited to speak at the March 2023 UC Board of Regents meeting in San Francisco, where I stated: “If the UC system wishes to expand its reach for disability justice, there are three key goals that the UC system needs to follow. Number one is to mandate universal access across all UC campuses. Universal access is the ability for students with disabilities to register for classes with an online/hybrid option no questions asked, no strings attached. Number two is for UC administrators to increase their funding and support for disabled resources centers so that they can provide additional resources needed to help disabled students thrive. Number three is to implement disabled student unions and disability cultural community centers on every single campus in the UC system. It is incredibly saddening to know that disability cultural community centers have only been implemented at UC Berkeley and that disabled student unions are only present at UC Davis and UCLA. It’s important to expand on these initiatives so that disabled students can have a place to promote advocacy and solidarity. This is a clear path for the regents, and by extension the UC system, to show support for the UC disabled student population and work to ensure a more inclusive, equitable future for the UC system.” The reactions from the room were mixed. A few of the regents were supportive, but most of them were oblivious to the issues I presented. It is important to continue addressing these issues at the next regents meeting being on May 16-18, and in any future meetings — where the regents will decide whether to increase funding for disability services across the UC system, affecting the lives of thousands of disabled students across every UC campus. The following is anexcerptfrom an official UCSA public comment script used at UC Regents meetings: “Across the entire UC system, the average disability specialist has a caseload of about 400 to 500 students, with some caseloads reaching 1,000 students. These massive caseloads cause month-long delays for students receiving accommodations. This can derail entire quarters for students due to the necessity of these accommodations in the completion of their schoolwork.” The data cited in the document came from various internal staffing sources derived from DSC Directors and UCOP reports. According to areportfrom the UC Office of the President (UCOP , more students with disabilities are being admitted into UC schools and seeking accommodations than ever before. However, there has also been no additional funding in Disabled Student Programs across all UC campuses since 2017. This data shows that disabled students across the UC system are dissatisfied; they feel that they do not belong and do not have the resources needed to succeed compared to students without disabilities. The UCs need to aid in making students with disabilities feel that their schools are places in which they can succeed and feel included. The UCI Disability Services Center (DSC is the predominant source of aid for students with disabilities at UCI. Currently, the DSC offers services such as holding tests at their office instead of the classroom and providing priority registration for classes. From my personal experience, I encountered several delays over two months trying to get registered with the DSC before my first year at UCI. There have been numerous instances where I’ve waited for a response from the DSC for multiple weeks, only to be redirected to another resource center on campus because the DSC did not have the capacity to address my concerns. Eventually, I stopped reaching out to the DSC because I realized that they could not assist me properly, compared to various resource centers aimed towards other student communities at UCI. These other centers, like the Womxn’s Center for Success and the UCI Latinx Resource Center, are accessible, easy to find, clear and helpful. And they have programs that exhibit solidarity and advocacy. The DSC, on the other hand, is located near the Antrepreneur Center, and in contrast, is far from the Student Center, where the other resource centers are located. Additionally, I was unaware of what resources the DSC could provide due to a lack of clarity and communication. There is also a lack of community for students with disabilities, in large part due to the absence of an official support group. If the DSC can solve these issues, they could become a valuable support hub for disabled students at UCI. Disability Services across the UC system are currently understaffed and underfunded, creating a large backlog of issues that causes great harm to students with disabilities across UC campuses. There needs to be a wave of support from elected officials, community leaders and student activists to push for increased funding for disability support services across the UC system. The UC Regents need to provide more resources and funding in order to support students with disabilities across all UC campuses. Those interested in providing support for the campaign canregisterto hold public comment at UC Regents meetings. One can also show support by followingACQUIRE, a UCSA disability justice organization, on Instagram for more information and updates about the campaign. Our voices are essential to help students with disabilities on campus through advancing the rights of disabled students across the UC system.

crimson_2023_62,"This op-ed is part of a special opinion package, “Antisemitism at Harvard, According to Seven Jewish Affiliates.”View the full package here. As bombs fall on Gaza, antisemitism has been a primary focus of college administrations, global media, and even the U.S. Congress. University President Claudine Gayformed an antisemitism advisory group, personally addressed members of Harvard Hillel and Harvard Chabad, and eventestified before a House committeeon campus antisemitism alongside other university leaders. Their testimony made international headlines, leading to the resignation of the University of Pennsylvania’s president and widespread calls for the removal of the others. As Jewish Harvard students, we have been thrust into the national spotlight. We question what exactly it illuminates and the intentions of those who shine it. Characterizations of the Jewish community and external efforts to ensure our safety have been made blindly, neglecting the broad diversity of Jewish perspectives. As Jews critical of Israel, our views have been ignored — and our very existence has gone unacknowledged — by the same institutions that claim to protect us. As far as we know, Gay has shown no interest in meeting with anti-Zionist, non-Zionist, or Zionist-questioning Jewish students despite our continuous requests that she do so, including our24-hour occupationof University Hall. After her apparent failure to engage with an entire sector of Harvard’s Jewish population, Gay then appeared before Congress to testify about her ostensible commitment to protecting Jewish students. We do not deny the threat of antisemitism which purportedly prompted this hearing. In fact, we are hyper-aware of antisemitism’s evils. Our ancestors fled extermination in Europe and their experiences are anything but unique. To be Jewish is to inherit the generational trauma of constant persecution. Today, this trauma is reinforced: There has been a nationwide rise in antisemitic crimes following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks. Yet discussions about fighting antisemitism are neither honest nor effective as long as they conflate criticism of the Israeli state with such hate. Just as we fear rising antisemitism, we fear how claims of antisemitism have been weaponized to excuse other forms of bigotry. Over the past few months, we have seen our pro-Palestinian peers and friends ruthlesslysilenced, doxxed, and harassed. These attacks have largely targeted Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, and Black students, and they have been shamefully justified under the guise of combating antisemitism. Yet while antisemitism has received an abundance of media coverage, government inquiry, and administrative response, anti-Palestinian hate, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and racism have only seen a fraction of that attention. Insidiously, some calls for retaliation against nonviolent activists have come from within the Jewish community. Harvard’s leading Jewish organizations have pushed forfurther policing of protest on campus, andcertain University alumnihave leveraged their power to endorse doxxing and encourage companies to deny students professional opportunities. The twisting of calls for Jewish safety — at the expense of other marginalized groups’ speech and security — mirrors the ongoing destruction abroad. The U.S. and Israeli governments continue to justify their collective punishment of the people of Gaza with the stated goals of Jewish and Israeli protection. In the process, over20,000 people have been killed, according to Gazan health officials.Eighty five percent of the population has been displacedand more than one in four Gazansare starving, according to the U.N. Thus, while discourse about antisemitism and speech on college campuses is vital, our conversations cannot distract from Gaza, whereexperts warn of genocide. Ending the present war on Gaza is only the first step. To bring an end to the longer violence of occupation, Palestinian liberation must come next. We understand that to many, such a concept — reflected through the phrase “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” — can, at best, seem ambiguous and, at worst, sound like a call for the violent elimination of Jews. For many Jews, the state of Israel represents the actualization of a dream too long deferred and the ultimate answer to centuries of Jewish expulsion and suffering. Indeed, this is how we were taught to conceptualize the state of Israel in our respective Hebrew schools, families, and wider Jewish communities. Our Jewish education left us to believe that Palestinian and Jewish freedom were somehow mutually exclusive, and that Jewish safety was predicated on the existence of the Israeli state and its quotidian militarization of Palestinian existence. In truth, Jewish safety — in Israel and the diaspora — is inextricably intertwined with Palestinian liberation. Jewish safety everywhere — including at Harvard — is at risk as long as Israel relies on the subjugation of millions to ensure such “safety.” The Jews living in the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea will never be truly free until Palestinians are also free to exist in and move throughout this entire region as equals. We hold fast to this vision of peace not in spite of, but precisely because of our Jewish identities, which we cherish. We are guided by the concept of tzedek — justice — anda rich tradition of Jewish protest and dissent. Most of all, we are guided by our own history of oppression: We cannot allow centuries of trauma to trap our people in eternal panic, grant the state of Israel total impunity, and sow agony for still more generations of Palestinians.

rice_thresher_2023_2,"ByJazmine Castillo1/17/23 11:47pm Editor’s Note: The following opinion piece contains references to fatphobia, disordered eating, thoughts of self harm, suicidal thoughts and child abuse. On Dec. 21, the following message was posted on Fizz: “Fat people are disgusting and I’m tired of people like you sugar coating it saying it’s ok. If you don’t want to be disgusting eat healthier and go to the gym. Yes of course some people will have it harder than others but that’s life, that doesn’t mean you get to hide under your ‘genetics’ and pretend you don’t look disgusting when you’re clearly obese and unhealthy.” The comments following it were full of blatant fatphobia, with dozens of upvotes. Sadly, this isn’t something new at Rice or limited to Fizz. Fatphobia is rampant throughout the culture here, often unsaid but rarely unnoticed, at least by those of us directly affected by it. But even that understates the importance here — fatphobia is harmful to everyone, including people who are “normal” sizes, because it encourages body dysmorphia, eating disorders, bullying and hatred on all levels and at all ages, and those who are posting these comments should be ashamed of themselves. I’m writing this because I am fat. Supposedly synonymous with: disgusting, vile and lazy. But, fat is not a bad word, despite the fact that the student body seems to think it is. Y’all say that being fat results from poor self control or laziness, but I was seven when I realized that I was fat, when I first wished I could cut off pieces of myself, even though my habits were the same as my peers. Even without getting into the science — that there are uncontrollable factors that make people larger from differences in genetics to varying gut bacteria — do you think it’s ok to put a seven year old on a diet? That’s when I was first introduced to one. The only time in my life that I could ever be considered thin was when I was 12, living in an abusive home, depressed, suicidal and starving myself. Once out of that home, I gained the weight all back, and then more. I was told I took up too much space but would still never be enough. Would you tell that kid the same things you were saying hiding behind anonymity on Fizz? Then, I came to Rice, where nearly everyone is skinny. And I know you all noticed I wasn’t from the moment O-Week started. It was a mutual understanding. But at some point, I decided I was done hating myself, done trying to earn the respect that everyone else had by default. You tell me I need self control. Fewer calories in than calories burned. Go to the gym. As though I haven’t known that since before I hit puberty. As if I don’t know how many calories are in each piece of safety chicken and my maintenance caloric intake. If you’re going to be so obsessed with my body, at least tell me something I don’t know. Every one of you should reconsider how you treat the fat people in your life. You claim to “worry about my health,” even with my normal blood pressure and pulse and other stats, because fat people in good health don’t fit into your worldview. No matter what you were taught growing up or what you think is happening with someone else’s health, fatphobia is not okay. Just like any other hatred, this needs to be called out. I know you’re fatphobic, and you know you’re fatphobic, so next time, say it to my face and face the fact that I’m a real person that you’re choosing to hate because of something that doesn’t affect you in any way. Or change. Look up resources on how to battle fatphobia, both internally and what you hear from those around you. Be a good ally, or at least try not to be an asshole to those who don’t look like you. Don’t mention someone’s weight, how much they’re eating, or that they should hit the gym, whether that friend is big or small. And if you refuse to change, then realize that you’re just a hateful, bigoted person and accept that fact — you are choosing to hate an entire group of people for physical characteristics that have no impact on your life. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2023_126,"Every other Thursday night in the spring, at approximately 9 p.m., Harvard Yard is struck by a joyful eruption of sound. A lone baritone saxophonist plays the opening notes to the Budweiser jingle “Here Comes the King.” He is quickly joined by an assortment of other saxophones, trumpets, mellophones, flutes, and clarinets, and a sprinkling of snare and bass drums. The entourage moves from the Science Center Plaza to Massachusetts Avenue, filling the cavernous expanse of the Yard with thundering polyphony. These magnetic, musical rumblings met me at my desk one fateful evening last November, drawing me out of my room. My memory of that night is a blur of detached moments: Racing down the stairs of Straus Hall, sprinting down a dark pathway, and trailing alongside the Harvard University Band as they marched on merrily through the night. I wanted to know — I had to know — where they were going. I asked, and one of the percussionists told me to follow them back to the band room. So I tagged along, to a basement on Mount Auburn Street, moving forward in a state somewhere between walking and flying, floating on a sonic wave. A lot of spaces on this campus require you to prove yourself before you can feel like you belong. It’s as if getting into Harvard wasn’t hard enough — we must also apply for some classes, endure a months-long process to join most clubs, and know the right people to be accepted into select social circles. Harvard is an institution of higher learning, but to succeed here, it often feels as though you need to already know everything there is to learn. This paralyzing pressure vanishes at the door of 74 Mount Auburn St. My first night in the band room, I was met with the most welcoming reception I have received at this school: I left with a trumpet, a super suave blazer, and a plethora of new faces to wave hello to when walking around campus. Granted, ‘playing’ in the band is a generous description of what I do as third trumpet; I still feel like a musical impostor at times. For one, consistently making a sound on the trumpet has only been a recent breakthrough for me. Despite years of piano lessons, my sheet music reading capabilities are abysmal, so on the off chance that I do produce a note, it’s usually the wrong one. During our gigs, 99 percent of the time I am not even remotely playing the correct tune. But the amazing thing about the band is that none of that matters. My bandmates don’t mind that I entered their community on a whim, or that the first rehearsal I attended was also the first time I had ever touched a trumpet. They have taught me to play — one of my fellow trumpet players leads weekly sectionals to guide new players through the basics — all while fostering a community of radical acceptance, with weekly shoutouts and Starbursts on bus rides home from gigs. Many of my peers arrive at Harvard having already mapped out their plans to join pre-professional clubs and apply for exclusive summer internships. They view their time here as transactional, treating Harvard as a stop along the way to great experiences rather than a great experience in itself. My friends in the band have shown me a different perspective. They have taught me how to be spontaneous, seek out the novel and absurd, and linger just a little bit longer in the space between adolescence and adulthood. The band’s unofficial motto is “illegitimi non carborundum,” mock Latin for “don’t let the bastards grind you down.” It’s printed on the back of our sweatshirts and written into an extra verse of the most recognizable fight song we play, “Ten Thousand Men of Harvard.” Every time I think of the three words of our motto, I smile, because they remind me to act without fear of judgment. Even if you’ve never done something before, or if you’re not exactly sure how it will fit into your future, don’t be afraid to try it out. We have these four years to wander, searching for doors of opportunity cracked ajar — and the rest of our lives to figure out what we learned about ourselves from the things we discovered behind those doors. The thought of joining a band in college had never once crossed my mind until I heard one outside my window. I still have many traditions to learn, and a basic level of proficiency in the trumpet to achieve, but for now, I will happily join my bandmates in tossing shoes and paper airplanes through the air at rehearsal, even if I don’t know what for. I feel the same way today that I felt that first night I entered the band room — satisfied with tagging along for the ride, even if the destination isn’t always clear. Violet T. M.

ubyssey_2023_26,"April 12, 2023 Written byCasey Cooper After reflecting on some work by Indigenous feminist scholarDian Million, I have learned that students tend to view anger within academic writing as reductive. As students, we are taught that academic work, especially historical work, needs to be objective. Scholar Mansoor Niaz explains that objectivity has become synonymous with science. This false equivalency is then regurgitated by conservative commentators with their slogan“facts don’t care about your feelings”. There is a fear that social sciences have stepped further away from their scientific nature — further from the truth — and claims “little interest in rigorous research” in our “preference for anecdotal evidence,” according to Maximilian Felsch’s“The Scientific Shortcomings of Postcolonial Theory.”These groups understand objectivity as void of bias while it actually creates a bias against emotions in academia. This requirement for objectivity, specifically regarding Indigenous issues, can cause individuals to view Indigenous women s emotional academic work negatively due to its perceived reductive nature. This negativity discredits the views and theories of Indigenous women, further limiting their ability to exist in academia. Anger is often where theory stems from and, therefore, it is productive. Stories about and written by Indigenous women are seldom published. UBC students should seek out and uplift work by Indigenous authors where they unapologetically express their anger. As aMétiswoman, I am tired of pretending to be content with our current reality — I am angry. I see the way that academia informs negative perceptions of Indigenous people. Indigenous women are continually represented as irrational or overly emotional in an effort to undermine and discredit our lived experiences. Indigenous scholar,Rachel Flowers, highlights that discrediting emotions frames Indigenous women s responses to colonial violence as inappropriate, and says that the ‘proper’ way to respond to this violence is in an objective, and therefore productive, way. There may be a hesitation to center stories of Indigenous women s anger in an effort to not contribute to these stereotypes of ‘emotionally irrational’ women. Still, by stripping these stories of emotion we are doing nothing more than making them palatable for settlers. In reality, Indigenous women’s anger offers richness to our politics and a new depth to our academic work. We are not offering a“distorted perception of reality that endangers the overall reputation of the social sciences,”as argued by Felsch. We are the reality. Our anger is an assertion that we are not passive victims of colonial violence but rather, continually exist in opposition to colonial powers. Academic journals and media at UBC, likeThe Ubyssey,have the ability to represent Indigenous women’s anger in an authentic way. When our work is disregarded within academia, student media can call attention to the different types of theorizing that are being done within Indigenous spaces. While educating others, uplifting our voices is an encouragement of Indigenous women s academic work. We have seen what media outside of academia, like social media, allows in regards to social movements likeBlack Lives MatterandIndigenous women s activism. This media has fewer barriers in place and allows the spread of theories that would not have otherwise been published, and student-led media can do the same. I want to see more journalistic and scholarly articles that uplift the emotional and personal work that is being produced within Critical Indigenous Studies. Million said colonialism’s strongest defence is silence. If we continue to allow the misrepresentation of anger, then we are acting in accordance with colonization.

stanforddaily_2023_15,"To: President Marc Tessier-Lavigne Provost Persis Drell Jerry Yang, Chair, Stanford Board of Trustees Condoleezza Rice, Director, Hoover Institute We write with regard to the fact that Mr. K. Rupert Murdoch is a member of the Hoover Institute’sBoard of Overseers. Given that Provost Drell and Director Rice have stated that they intend “increased interaction” between the University and the Hoover, we address both the Director of the Hoover and the senior administration of the University, as well as the chair of the Board of Trustees, who serve as stewards of Stanford University. We are alarmed that Mr. Murdoch, chairman of Fox News, has facilitated the spread of lies with regard to the 2020 election. Recent information emerging from the lawsuit brought against Fox by voting machine companies Dominion and Smartatic show that Fox News anchors knew the information they were broadcasting to the American people was untrue, yet they repeated these lies over and over again, seeking to increase Fox’s market share and to profit off these lies. Crucially, these were not just any lies — the misinformation purposefully spewed out by Fox fueled the Insurrection and continues to form the basis for extremely dangerous beliefs that can, as we now know, translate into catastrophic actions, which include death and real threats to the democratic process. Murdoch’s role in this scandal is clear. Fortune Magazinenotes: Rupert Murdoch acknowledged that he didn’t stop various Fox News commentators from promoting unfounded claims from Trump allies that the election was stolen, even though he could have. He also acknowledged that some of the network’s hosts — Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity — at times endorsed the false claims. Fox shows no sign whatsoever of changing its pattern of deception and deceit for the sake of financial gain. Just recently, even after the exposure of its calculated and cynical dissemination of falsehoods, one of Fox’s most popular anchors, Tucker Carlson, showed cherry-picked segments of video records of the January 6 Insurrection, using these decontextualized bits to make patently false claims about the entire day’s events. As NBCreports: Carlson focused Monday’s segment on promoting former President Donald Trump’s narrative by showing video of his supporters walking calmly around the U.S. Capitol. He asserted that other media accounts lied about the attack, proclaiming that while there were some bad apples, most of the rioters were peaceful and calling them “sightseers,” not “insurrectionists.” This revisionist history is not only shameful, it is extremely dangerous — it will encourage the continuance of conspiracy theories about a “stolen” election and exculpate the guilty. As National Public Radiohas stated, this is not the first time Mr. Murdoch has engaged in questionable actions: Murdoch has been called to answer for the practices of his media outlets before.News of the World— at one point a flagship tabloid paper for the Murdoch empire in the U.K — was the subject of scandal back in 2011 for reporting tactics that included hacking into people’s phones. The paper shut down and Murdoch was brought before a British parliamentary inquiry… former Australian prime minister and the newly appointed ambassador to the U.S., Kevin Rudd, has spent the last two years lobbying for an inquiry into media diversity in Australia. He has taken particular aim at the influence of the Murdoch media, and called Rupert Murdoch a threat to democracy. As far back as 2010, the Columbia Journalism Review publishedan essayusing precisely the same language, “Murdoch’s Threat to Democracy.” Let us be perfectly clear — in this letter we are not asking that you remove Murdoch from the Board. That is your decision alone. What we are asking of you is that you eachpublicly accountfor your acquiescence to Rupert Murdoch’s prestigious appointment to the Board, one which reflects not only on the Hoover, but also on Stanford. We ask — why is it that Rupert Murdoch is an Overseer? Does his expertise outweigh what many find to be his dangerously deficient sense of ethics? At the Faculty Senate meeting of Oct. 22, 2020, Provost Drellopined: “Over the past decade, Hoover has become much more integrated into Stanford. In a very real sense, and I think this is important to keep in mind, they are, in fact, us.” Rupert Murdoch is not “us.” In closing, we wonder what kind of signal his presence sends to our students, who we are training to seek the truth, and to our colleagues on the faculty, who are constantly held to the highest standards of honesty, truth and responsible scholarship. Why is someone who has proven himself an opponent to all these values on the Board? We look forward to hearing your reasoning. Sincerely,Laura Wittman, Associate Professor of French and Italian Rita Agarwal, Clinical Professor The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor. We’d love to hear your thoughts. Email letters to the editor to eic ‘at’ stanforddaily.com and op-ed submissions to opinions ‘at’ stanforddaily.com."
crimson_2023_35,"If you ever find yourself walking down Mount Auburn St., make a stop at the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research. There, you will find Harvard’s Hiphop Archive and Research Institute, which contains classic records like “To Pimp a Butterfly,” “Illmatic,” and “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” Hip-hop, like the best of the Black musical tradition, contains artists who confront oppression and hatred with resistance and love. Aship-hop turns 50 this year, we have an important opportunity for reflection. Let’s not just listen — let’s consider this powerful style of bounce and rhythm’s deep roots in protest. One of hip-hop’s greatest protest records is Dead Prez’s 2000 album “Let’s Get Free.” It is no coincidence that the LP sounds like it came out of the Black Panther Party headquarters in Oakland, Calif. — this is because Stic.man and M-1 used their debut project to embrace the principles of socialism, self-defense, and solidarity among African peoples. “Let’s Get Free” remains one of the brightest gems of hip-hop’s 50-year existence. The marriage of record scratching and drum breaks came at a time when the Civil Rights and Black Power era was in decline. By the early 1970s, dozens of leaders in the Black freedom movement had been murdered, imprisoned, or exiled. A generation of Black youth grew up under the drug war, mass incarceration, and abject poverty, all of which became themes brought to life in hip-hop revolutionary groups like The Coup, X Clan, and Public Enemy. When Dead Prez dropped in 2000, however, the direction of hip-hop was uncertain. On one hand, the genre had become a commercial powerhouse. Lauryn Hill became the first hip-hop artist to win album of the year at the 1999 Grammys, and hip-hop became the best-selling music genre in the United States. On the other hand, the two most recognizable faces of the genre, 2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G., were murdered, and consumerism and celebrity culture enveloped the art. While the future of the genre was unknown, “Let’s Get Free” reintroduced revolutionary, anti-establishment music into the mainstream. We should understand the album itself as a compilation of anthems against miseducation. In the song “They Schools,” the group charges institutional schooling with teaching Black children how to be “slaves and hardworkers for white people,” only glorifying the history of Europeans while asserting that Black people were three-fifths of human beings. The project rails against mass media narratives in tracks like “Propaganda” and “Psychology,” voicing eerily similar concerns to those Americans have today about surveillance and misinformation. It’s through these angles that Dead Prez shows hip-hop’s capacity to question the sources of our worldview and those who manipulate it. The tradition of the Black Panther Party, a community-oriented Black liberation organization, is all over “Let’s Get Free.” Dead Prez embodied the Panthers with self-defense instrumentals on songs like “Police State” and “Behind Enemy Lines,” waging war against carceral capitalism. The group takes shots at contemporaries for compromising their art for mass consumption, with Stic.man saying, “I’ll take a slug for the cause like Huey P,” the co-founder of the Panthers, while accusing most rappers of trying to “copy Master P.” Dead Prez is also brilliant in how they demonstrate crucial links between physical and mental health and revolutionary struggle. Guitar strings on “Be Healthy” are accompanied by messages to “eat what comes from the ground” in order to let “your food be your medicine.” Likewise, “Mind Sex” and “Happiness” focus on positive illustrations of masculine intimacy beyond the physical. These tracks initially feel like an abrupt interruption of the revolutionary rhetoric, but a closer look reveals Dead Prez’s prescient message: Health as a source of empowerment is essential to collective struggle. Perhaps the most remembered track from this record is “Hip Hop.” The walk-on song to “Chappelle’s Show,” “Hip Hop” was a critique of the commercialization of the genre and a warning to its artists. Dead Prez paints the record labels as dope dealers who use Black artists to write rhymes while leaving them broke. Its distorted bassline guides us through a message about being true to oneself as an artist despite the grip of capital on the music industry. There’s a good reason the track is iconic in the history of the genre, appearing in the music of 50 Cent, Drake, and Chance the Rapper. Like every musical genre that has garnered commercial success, hip-hop has had its vultures and exploiters. But there are also many who keep up the soul, creativity, and individuality that made the culture so popular in the first place. Innovators of the art should never let the rule of cash dictate their ability to control their narrative or style — and I’m hopeful that they won’t. “Let’s Get Free” represents the best of what hip-hop is and can be. The project is a master performance of Afrocentric revolutionary politics that pits itself against police violence, predatory capitalism, and various forms of propaganda. Its foundation is built on an intense passion for self-determination and community control that Dead Prez holds far beyond their acclaimed album. “Let’s Get Free” reminds us that it truly isbigger than hip-hop. We should listen and appreciate the tradition the record carries on. Prince A. Williams ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a History concentrator in Adams House."
state_press_2023_19,"While both forms of citizenship are to be encouraged, there is a problem: this lack of affinity towards duty-based citizenship too often impedes the desires of younger generations. Young people have historically had thelowest voter turnout rates. Often this is attributed to a lack of interest, however, it s not that simple. While there are many contributing factors, one of the most significant today is the unique form of civic participation younger generations tend to favor:engaged citizenship. Engaged citizenship is the practice of partaking in activist behaviors that aim to directly drive political and social change outside the confines of the electoral calendar. Examples include participating in protests, petitions and boycotts. Engaged citizenship differs from duty-based citizenship, upon which the United States has built its political structure. Duty-based citizenship refers to the practices that traditionally come to mind when thinking about model civic participation. Examples here are voting in elections, reporting crime and serving on a jury. These two forms of citizenship are not exclusive. One can exhibit both, but as a general trend older people tend to be more inclined toward duty-based citizenship and younger people tend to favor engaged citizenship. While both forms of citizenship are to be encouraged, there is a problem: this lack of affinity towards duty-based citizenship too often impedes the desires of younger generations. Sure, petitions, protests and association lobbying can all make statements and bring attention to important issues. However, they are simply insufficient when it comes to bringing about the force of law. This points to why we must also engage in duty-based citizenship. We need to vote. Fundamentally, the political structure in the United States is designed in such a way that voting is the most effective way for citizens to express and enact their political will. Consequently, the U.S. government is dominated by the views of the older population which turns out at a greater rate for elections. Politicians appeal and cater to those who are going to cast a vote and put them in office. It follows, then, that as millennials and Gen Z, we will not see our views infused into government policy until we step into the voting booth in significantly greater numbers. For evidence of this, look no further than the 2022 midterm elections. Younger voter turnout wasthe second highest for a midtermin the past 30 years and theybroke hard for Democrats, even in swing states. Traditionally young voters had a roughly 20% turnout rate for midterm elections. In the 2022 midterms, it hiked up to about 27%. This was a leading contributor to the notable lack of the expected red wave. Consider Arizona, which based on past voting patterns seemed as susceptible to a red wave as any state. Yet, this did not happen. Why not? Sure, the Republicans put up low-quality candidates. However, another major factor was the youth support for Democratic candidates. Depending on the individual race, between71% to 76%of the youth vote went Democratic. In fact, when Sen. Mark Kelly was asked at which point on election day he felt confident in his victory, he said, When I saw the local news and they were reporting about the long lines at Arizona State University, like 30 minutes before the polls closed. I turned to somebody and said, We’re going to win. The weight of the youth vote wasn t only felt in Arizona. Other key battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia had outcomes that were also highly dependent on younger voters. Even states where the Democratic candidates did not win felt the effects. Look, for example, at Wisconsin, where Republican senate incumbent Ron Johnson had every reason to believe the expected red wave would return him to Washington. His race against Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes, however, was much closer than anyone had anticipated — largely due to the efforts of younger voters,63%of whom were Democratic. In the end, Barnes finished only1%behind Johnson, a fact that teaches us two lessons. First, the youth vote isincreasingly going to be a key factorin election outcomes. Second, a national 27% youth turnout is still not enough. Interestingly, there is an opportunity for us to put our money where our mouth is in just a few weeks. In May, there will be a special election in Tempe.

crimson_2023_171,"Each year, the University’s administration proudly declares its celebration of a multitude of marginalized groups’ heritage months, societal days of awareness, and cultural holidays, broadcasting its supposed allyship out to the world with a smile. At first glance, Harvard’s announcements sound like a nice thought; these occasions are certainly worth acknowledging. The problem is, when a nice thought is never backed up by actions, it is just that — a fleeting thought. I’m afraid Harvard’s money is nowhere near its mouth. The unfortunate truth is, Harvard seemingly shirks serious self-reflection and meaningful investments into progress both within and beyond the University. Instead of concrete change, it appears that Harvard gravitates toward every performative gesture it can make as long as it requires little genuine effort and demands little meaningful action. After all, where was Harvard when dozens of Black student organizations on campus wrote a letter to the administration denouncing their response to theLeverett swattingattack? And where was Harvard when their students called for the University todename Winthrop House, a House named after the family responsible for the legalization of slavery in the Massachusetts Bay Colony? Where was Harvard when students time and time again called for it to create an Ethnic Studies concentrationover the course of 50 years? And where was Harvard when students repeatedlycalled for amulticultural center, demanding that the University acknowledge the daily challenges that students of color face at predominantly white institutions? Some might be quick to respond, “Harvard defended affirmative action for you, so you should be grateful.” And to some extent, I am. But the University’s record on issues of racial diversity is far messier than that retort admits. After all, in the very same case in which itdefended affirmative action, Harvard fervently defended its preferences for students on the so-called Dean’s Interest List and who have legacy status — both policies well known for the fact that they heavilyfavor wealthy white studentsin admissions. When seen in this light, it becomes clear that the University is not necessarily interested in the mission of “defending diversity.” It is certainly interested in preserving its status. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean prioritizing the wellbeing of students. If anything, Harvard has made it abundantly clear that they intend to maintain their shining public image above all else. Unfortunately, change is rarely the best PR. After all, it requires acknowledging that a problem existed in the first place, something Harvard has proven unwilling to do unless its hand has been forced. Harvard has been known for many things over the years, but handing matters of race well is rarely one of them. The truth is, Harvard only began to seriously consideradmitting students of colorafter Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Today, the affirmative action programs that were born in the wake of Dr. King’s death have beentorn to shreds by the Supreme Court, and the very same university that purports to “defend diversity” seems to have gone silent. Months after the Supreme Court’s decision in SFFA v. Harvard striking down race-based affirmative action, countless students await changes to our admissions policy, hoping for some sort of meaningful effort to rebuild the diversity that Harvard claims to treasure so dearly. But Harvard has yet to deliver. If Harvard wants to prove to its students of color that they are more than a fleeting thought, it has a plethora of options. Harvard could easily devote a small fraction of last year’s$406 million budget surplusto the construction of a multicultural center. Or Harvard could finally recognize ethnic studies as a valid academic discipline, offering more courses on its subject matter and enshrining it as a concentration at the College. Or Harvard could easily step away from systematically granting legacy students and those the Dean’s Interest list a bonus in admissions. Or Harvard could easily dename Winthrop House, as more than 1,000 total petitioners — including nearly 50 of Winthrop’s own descendants — have called for. Any one of these actions could begin to show students that Harvard treats diversity as more than a statistic. But as we wait for Harvard to take its students of color seriously, remember: Without action to back it up, “defend diversity” is just a slogan. Joseph W. Hernandez ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Government concentrator in Adams House."

Where will we grow towards, if we start to think differently about how the world is?” –Ocean Vuong(2020 On Dec. 19, the Wall Street Journal published anopinion piececalling out Stanford’sElimination of Harmful Language Initiative. The article criticized Stanford’s detailed index of inclusive words and stoked discussions surrounding the initiative, which have been largely negative; following the WSJ article, the list was criticized by outlets such asFox NewsandUSA Today. All this negative media coverage ultimately culminated in Stanfordwithdrawing the listfor reconsideration. To be fair,certain wordslisted as “to be eliminated” were even in my view unnecessary — such as “seminal” being forbidden for promoting the patriarchy, or “master” being banned because “historically, masters enslaved people.” However, amid all this negative backlash I did want to provide an alternative view — I truly believe Stanford meant well and that, especially since this list was a guide and not a mandate, it would have had an overall positive impact on its readers, educating them on the connotations that certain words could have. Why must there be limits on our wish to be inclusive? Isn’t “too careful” always better than “too brash,” if it means we can protect another person’s sense of self? Overall, I believe that the list made some excellent suggestions for inclusive alternatives to common phrases. The general view of opponents of the initiative appears to be that words are shallow, and should not be given outsized importance. For example, the WSJ editors called out the University for wasting tuition dollars on useless “make-work” for the University administrators who are responsible for this initiative. But in thinking this way, what the opponents fail to recognize is that this list is about a lot more than a shallow attempt to appear “politically correct” — asstudieshave showntimeandtimeagain, words matter. The way we talk about the things around us shapes how we perceive them. For example, the list recommends using the phrase “person who has immigrated” instead of the word “immigrant”. This recommendation is disparaged in the WSJ article, which says sarcastically — “It’s the iron law of academic writing: Why use one word when four will do?” But the article fails to consider the large impact that these few additional words can have on immigrant identity. This change isrecommended by Stanfordbecause “using person-first language helps to not define people by just one of their characteristics.” People who have immigrated are multidimensional people who should be able to lean into their immigrant identity as much or as little as they want, without feeling defined by it. This slight change in wording empowers them, every time it is uttered, to make this choice — and to me, as a person who has immigrated, it truly feels great. PsychologistRobert Rosenthalfamously coined the term “Pygmalion Effect,” (1968 to describe the phenomenon in which others’ expectations about oneself can influence one’s behavior and performance. As part of his research, he designed an experiment where he randomly assigned lab rats the labels of “smart” and “dumb,” and examined the effects of these labels on their performance as they competed against each other in racing through a maze. As discussed in an episode ofThe On Being Project, “The reality was that they were both normal mice.” There was nothing special about either of them. “But the one labeled the superior mouse always went through the maze faster.” That phenomenon is still under study, but one theory is that the “smart” labeled mice succeeded because the human beings who attended them subconsciously treated them differently — the mice that had the “smart” label were tended to with more care. This study shows the importance of the words we use to describe different kinds of people – not only does it affect self-image, but also affects how others treat you. Thus, recognizing the importance of our words is an important step in changing the way we associate with language. Being deliberate about how we articulate our world can have an immense impact on how we exist within it. Stanford’s Elimination of Harmful Language initiative is an essential step in making the university environment a place where everyone can feel welcomed and accepted. I am optimistic that, in its next installment, the administration will do an even better job of creating a true index of inclusive language. And I urge you to look at even the current version with a fair eye, cutting through the negative media coverage and giving it the benefit of a doubt.

crimson_2023_4,"In September of 2022, I became depressed. I’ve battled depression for most of my life, and this iteration was not caused by any misdeeds on Harvard’s part. Really, I don’t know what caused it. Nobody is to blame, except maybe the inevitability of change and separation. That elusivity made the depression feel hopeless in a way that it never had before. It wasn’t explained by being mercilessly bullied, or by losing someone I loved. It couldn’t be fixed by moving to a city, or by pretending I was happy. Sometimes I would walk back to my dorm at midnight, exhausted, cold, and alone, and just stop and stare forward, hating myself for feeling the way I did. But when I got home for winter break, I watched “Harvey.” “Harvey” is a comedy film, released in 1950, based on a play by Mary Chase. It follows Elwood P. Dowd, an eccentric alcoholic whose best friend is an invisible, six-foot-tall rabbit named Harvey, as well as his sister Veta and her attempts to institutionalize him. Initially, Elwood is ostracized, treated like dirt by everyone in his life. But as the movie goes on, more people start to listen to him and come to see him as an exceedingly kind, gentle, and loving man. In one of my favorite lines of the movie, Elwood says: “Years ago, my mother used to say to me — she’d say, ... ‘In this world, Elwood, you must be oh so smart, or oh so pleasant.’ Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant.” I was inspired to watch “Harvey” while reading John M. Green’s “The Anthropocene Reviewed,” a book of nonfiction essays in which the author reviews aspects of his life on a five-star scale. In his review of the film, Green invokes Elwood’s quote while talking about his own debilitating bout with depression. It made him feel less alone, made him more comfortable, and gave him hope. “In December of 2001, there was perhaps no human alive on Earth who needed to hear those words more than I did,” Green says. Like it did for Green, “Harvey” gave me hope and reason. And like Green said, “Hope is not easy or cheap. It is true.” For so much of my life, I’ve tried to be “oh so smart.” This came to a head in the sixth grade during my first serious bout with depression. I was being mercilessly bullied, but my defensive response was to become self absorbed, mean, and combative. I had dangerously low self confidence and a desperate need for validation, because of a deep rooted worry that I was insignificant. After sixth grade, I tried to change. I moved schools, surrounded myself with different people. The most important change, however, was a newfound willingness to listen. I continued to battle occasional depression, but it felt manageable. I wasn’t the only person struggling with self worth, with sadness, or with pain. That gradual realization also came with a dramatic shrinkage of my overinflated ego. I built legitimate confidence — the type that wasn’t rooted in convincing myself that I was superior to others. I realized, for the first time, that everyone was just as complex as I was. But the ugliness that used to dominate my life began to bubble up again when I moved to Cambridge. My progress wasn’t completely undone, but I felt, for the first time in years, the need to be smart, which is perhaps an unfortunate inevitability of being at a place like Harvard. And what I needed, desperately, was to be pleasant. In “Harvey,” when Elwood is talking to two Sanitarium workers who’ve tracked him down about the people he meets at the local bar, he says: “They tell about the big terrible things they’ve done and the big wonderful things they’ll do. Their hopes and their regrets, their loves and their hates. All very large, because nobody ever brings anything small into a bar.” Nobody ever brings anything small into a party, a rehearsal, a class, or anywhere, really. Listening has made me realize that I’m not alone — and that really, nobody else is, either. Those moments where I’m pleasant, not smart, are the best moments of my life. I want to know people’s wants and hopes and regrets. And I want to be there for people to share them with me. I want to understand those big things. Doing that has made me happier and more pleasant, and it has filled my life with beauty. It has made me realize that my ongoing mental health struggle is not a curse I uniquely have been bestowed with, but that pain and grief are universal. The world is amazing, complicated, and messy. And by far the most amazing, most complicated, and messiest part of the world is people. We have spent thousands of years trying to understand what it means to be human. And the only way we can do that is to listen, and to understand what it’s like to be someone other than ourselves. I’m not expecting you to be as kind as Elwood. I’m just asking you to listen, to try to understand the people around you. It will fill your life with beauty and complexity. Next time you feel alone, sit down and listen to someone you care about. And try watching “Harvey.” Vander O. B. Ritchie ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Matthews Hall."
stanforddaily_2023_35,"Twitter is going through a deep governance crisis. In case you’ve been skipping the news, Elon Musk bought Twitter. He initially promisedhe would take a laissez-faire approach to content moderation and ban only what is prohibited by law. I admit that this made sense to me: while being conscious of the harms of unmoderated social media, I believed that social media companies were overstepping their role as custodians of our public sphere. But Musk’s actions were very much the opposite from his original vision:he banned an account posting (publicly accessible coordinates for his private jet,then banned the accounts of journalists from outlets like The New York Timesand The Interceptwho reported on this. Hethen practically banned mentions of competitors.Throughout this, he made arbitrary referendums on content policy on his personal account through “polls”(how many of these poll votes are from actual people and not bots is unclear . This is disappointing, but also unsurprising: the leaders of platforms like Twitter can make mostly unilateral calls about content moderation, so this is business as usual in our social media landscape. This might seem like drama that concerns mostly our Silicon Valley neighbors, but it very much concerns us all. We rely on social media platforms like Twitter to share information with our peers, understand what is going on in our communities and in the world, and express ourselves. Twitter has become a crucial piece of our infrastructure for communication, the same way the telephone network and highways serve an important role in connecting us. When Twitter is down, it is impossible to go about doing some of our daily tasks as usual. We need communication infrastructure with accountability and sustainability — otherwise, we are at risk of arbitrary and opaque governance that goes against the principles of a free university. An answer to this: Stanford must open an official server onMastodon, a nonprofit, open-source social media network. In the past years, academics have been using Twitter as an infrastructure for sharing resources and ideas. When Twitter’s long-term stability was challenged and its moderation policies seemed to be unpredictable, many scholars started questioning their dependence on Twitter as an infrastructure. The reaction of many was to self-exile to Mastodon. Mastodon works like a decentralized Twitter. Instead of having just one centralized platform, Mastodon consists of many different communities, called servers. There is no “main” Mastodon server: you can choose to join any server you like, and you can follow users from other servers. The server you join determines where your posts are hosted, and who moderates your posts: the administrators of each server can make the call of what accounts and content are banned. It’s not clear how a simple move from Twitter to any old Mastodon server is a positive move for most Stanford researchers. Without a doubt, our dependence on Twitter is bad: we cannot depend on Elon Musk’s goodwill to communicate about our research. But the way that many of Mastodon’s servers are currently laid out is also problematic. In truth, the governance of Mastodon servers is not much more transparent than Twitter’s: moderators make decisions largely opaquely, and rules are not decided upon collectively. Also, we need our infrastructure to be robust: a highway isn’t too useful if it breaks down unpredictably. While Mastodon’s distributed nature ensures that the network persists despite one server’s failure,users were unable to use Mastodon’s most popular server after it suffered a DDoS attack recently. That’s why Stanford should make its own server — officially run and hosted by Stanford Information Technology in much the same way other university internet services are. The proposal might sound eccentric, but in reality, Stanford already takes care of a large part of our community’s information infrastructure. The Stanford email service is an example of this: all Stanford affiliates have access to a @stanford.edu email. Of course, there are other service providers out there, like Gmail, that provide access to email for free. But Stanford’s email service ensures us that the infrastructure will be there in the long term and that we do not depend too much on the strategic decisions of a private company. Stanford’s Mastodon server should only allow Stanford affiliates to create accounts, the same way that only Stanford affiliates can get @stanford.edu emails. Thanks to Mastodon’s decentralized network, this would still mean that users of Stanford’s Mastodon server could read posts from users in other networks and engage with them. This is the way that MIT’s Mastodon server works: I could only createmy Mastodon accounton mastodon.mit.edu because I got my master’s degree from there last year, yet I can follow users from most Mastodon servers. And like most Stanford infrastructure, Stanford’s Mastodon server should be maintained through paid employees.MIT’s server is run by students, who volunteer their time to maintain public digital infrastructure. While this work can be extremely appreciated, it is not quite the approach that Stanford should take. If social media is part of academic life, then those running this piece of infrastructure should be trained professionals, not overworked students. Opening any space of exchange on the internet inevitably leads to the question of what can be said, and who will be in charge of enforcing this moderation. Conflicts around acceptable speech at Stanford are generally judged against its honor code through an intentionally slow process. Social media happens at a faster pace, and, as many communication scholars have shown throughout the years, so do its harms. The solution to this could be to create a content moderation council, formed by faculty and students, that could decide the rules and procedures for adapting the university’s honor code to the context of social media. Stanford’s communicative infrastructure cannot depend on the judgment of social media companies or volunteer maintainers of servers, and social media is too important for our university to leave on the hands of profit-making enterprises or well-meaning nonprofits. As more members of Stanford’s community move to Mastodon as an alternative to Twitter, the administration should provide the resources to ensure that this does not jeopardize scholars’ ability to express themselves freely. Through collaboration, Stanford can create the digital public infrastructure we need for our intellectual life.

wildcat_arizona_2023_20,"This month, the student-runCollege Republicansclub invited and sponsored a two-day demonstration by the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform on the University of Arizona Mall. Enclosed by a small metal fence, the group of older men and women proudly lingered underneath their various large billboards — each with a different image and description. One sign displayed a photo of a bruised child next to an embryo reading “Should the government prohibit child abuse?” Another claimed their graphic images of bloody, dismembered fetuses saved the life of a precious baby. As students gathered, demonstrators became swallowed by a sea of hot pink Planned Parenthood signs — the only barrier between them being the fence law enforcement had set up hours prior. Inside the fence, an older woman began filming me with her Samsung upon request for comment. Another man told me he didn’t know what College Republicans were, or who was sponsoring the demonstration — he was just here to volunteer. Custom for anyone wishing to schedule an event here on campus, the scheduled demonstration was required to be approved by the Arizona Student Unions scheduling office. Since College Republicans is a student club, the group had to also go through our student government’s guidelines. According to the Associated Students of the University of Arizona’sstudent organization handbook, if a club’s proposed event seems to be larger than normal, the organization may be asked to present at a Campus Use Committee meeting. Even as students walked away, the large photo displays of swastikas, lynchings and other genocides remained clear, unharmonious with the rows of palm trees lining the UA campus. It was then I found myself wondering how our administration defines an event as larger than normal and how hate symbols must have looked displayed at a Campus Use Committee meeting. When asked about the principles of hosting a demonstration like this, Arizona Student Unions event planner Cheryl Plummer was able to explain further on the second day of the demonstration. “They followed everything to the letter,” Plummer said. “We have followed everything to the letter because we don’t want to be told ‘you denied something.’ We do not deny. We cannot. We have to allow it.” Following the two-day long disruption on the UA Mall, students may question the tolerance of the administration, all just because rules were followed by the letter. Does the disturbing and hateful content shown on this campus become voided in the presence of paperwork and the pursuit to allow, to not deny? It seems as if all answers point to yes. “Students have the option to walk around or go the other way. This is an open venue. This is an open space,” Plummer said. “Students have the option to walk through the food court. We can’t regulate what they have because then we’re impeding their rights. It would be like me impeding you. You wouldn’t want that, you’d sue me.” Likely, a potential lawsuit is not the topic on most students’ minds. A campus climate where we don’t have to be advised to take another route to avoid a slew of slurs and graphic genocide seems more than sufficient. The truth is, we cannot go around the blatant hate both displayed and tolerated on our campus. We can’t take the food court shortcut, as much as administration might want us to. When starting a conversation surrounding the rules and regulations of free speech on campus, the only way is through. The anti-abortion group spent the two days they were here engaging in what they referred to as respectful dialogue with students. One anti-abortionist used the n-word multiple times while simultaneously claiming he was not racist. Students — Black and white — explained the origin of the word and its role within America’s past. More likely than not, this history lesson wasn’t a planned part of their Wednesday walk to class. Brunhi Salvant, a sophomore here at the UA, was among the students who spoke to the racist demonstrator. “He was like ‘Why do Black people get to call themselves the n-word like that but I can’t?’’’ Salvant said, referring to the same man. Unfortunately, Salvant was one of many students disturbed by the demonstrators. Various victims of past massacres were exploited on display by the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, in what seemed to me to be a clear attempt to create some sort of disturbing shock value. The posters of lynching, the Holocaust and many more graphic images were placed with intent to make a distorted comparison of abortion to genocide. It’s difficult to imagine images of swastikas and other hate symbols being given the okay by the administration whose title falls under “event planning.” It’s equally as difficult to imagine photos of lynchings being given the okay for a school with3.78%Black students and9.4%Jewish undergrad students. When I spoke with administration during the demonstration, I was continually reminded of the importance of protecting the anti-abortion group’s rights. I found myself thinking of my fellow women, my Black friends, my Jewish friends and asked myself who was protecting theirs. “Putting these pictures here, that triggers a lot of people,” Salvant said. “There’s people’s histories up there. The lynching of Black people, the Holocaust. I don’t want to be in college and I’m walking to class and I see one of my ancestors hanging from a tree, which I didn’t ask for.” Is it possible to preserve free speech without the distress of students? —Olivia Krupp, Opinions Editor If you ask the administration, the answer is foggy. Multiple requests for comment from both the Dean of Students Office, College Republicans club and President Dr. Robert C. Robbins were left unanswered. Time and time again this year, the university administration has let its student body down. The past week was another example of their failure to put student safety and education first. We are a public university with an open campus where “free speech” and First Amendment rights are granted. However, when that free speech is exercised at the expense of another’s well being, it should not be acceptable, especially by those who make a promise to their student body. A similar instance occurred in 2016 on DePaul University’s campus when College Republicans sponsored a right-winged presenter. Students and community organizers in opposition were left to defend themselves with little university back-up, much like we were. One counter-protestor in particular led the takedown of this hateful speech. “Let me be perfectly clear, I do not apologize for my actions on DePaul’s campus,” he said,as quoted bythe school’s independent student newspaper, The DePaulia. “I don’t apologize for refusing to allow a racist, bigot to spew his hatred on DePaul’s campus. I don’t apologize for shutting the event down. I don’t apologize.” Among those who were terrorized on our campus were Jewish students. Sophomore Daniel Wittenberg, president ofJ Street U of A, approached me with frustration. “I think this is a hateful and inflammatory display and I think it’s pretty clear the intent here is to upset as many people as possible,” he said. “Nearly 10%of U of A’s campus is Jewish, so 10% of our campus is going to be directly affected by that imagery of the Holocaust.” The Center for Bio-Ethical Reform’s comparison of abortion to genocide was a complete fallacy. Comparing abortion to genocide is claiming it to be “intentionally destroying part or all of a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, by killing people or by other methods,” according to the Cambridge University Dictionary. In reality, abortion is not carried out to target any minority group nor is it done with the intention of destroying the fetus population. Still, many of the anti-abortionists on campus that day claimed they were not scaring anyone and that “comparable does not mean identical.” But comparison is not relevant to this serious matter in the first place. University administration also failed to support Jewish students with any comment of solidarity. Freshman Andreana Finnegan, a fiery pro-choice student, watched as anti-abortionists constructed their display Thursday morning. “There was no education happening on this campus yesterday, nor is it happening today. I don’t know how anyone is meant to get an education in this environment, let alone feel safe,” Finnegan said. “I used to bring my little sister on this campus. I will never bring her again.” Not only was the student body affected, but many of those in the greater Tucson community were shaken as well. Surely families will not want to take chances walking on campus, risking the danger of running into another protest so severe. Clearly this was not a matter of simply walking in another direction as Plummer described; something so haunting is unavoidable and students should not have to worry about rushing in the opposite direction in the first place. Not only were we not warned of the disturbance ahead of time, but we were given a disappointing response (or lack thereof . When something this horrifying is presented on our campus, the administration cannot expect peace. Hateful protestors cannot expect “respectful dialogue.” Many students were angry and came ready to amplify their voices against hatred. They stood up for each other, empowered those who were exploited, while also confronting the College Republicans president Alton Zhang and the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform face-to-face. —Noor Haghighi, Opinions Writer No matter how closely policy is followed to the letter, the damage of hateful demonstrations have lasting effects on our campus. School is meant to be a comfortable place — not a place where individuals are bullied and groups of people are antagonized.

crimson_2023_106,"My earliest memories of Kashmir lie with my grandparents, in the fine grooves of their fragile palms and the soft hums of their leisured speech. In between verses of Urdu and Kashmiri that glide past my ears, they call me their jaan, their kurbaan: their life, their sacrifice. They call me their jigar, their liver — and though it perhaps makes for a quite unsavory translation, I learn years later that the body cannot survive in the liver’s absence; that my grandparents and I, separated by one generation and even more oceans, breathe and bleed together. I often struggle to imagine a Kashmir undecorated by my grandparents’ handprints, by the scenes of their childhoods and adolescence that they would spin over their regular evening chai: of a Dal Lake so pristine that even a penny tossed into the water would glisten across its twenty-foot depth or of their electrifying treks onto snow-capped Himalayan mountains from which their eyes could meet the soil of Pakistan. But when age — when my grandparents’ age — begins to sound less like the triumphant extinguishing of candles and more like the pounding drum of a clock, I wonder what will then tether me to this rich memoryscape that they have so tenderly tilled throughout their lives. For me, it is this Kashmir — their Kashmir — that is home. But as I drift across different spaces at Harvard, especially South Asian-centered institutions and initiatives, I am forever haunted by the chilling reminder that here, Kashmir is never a home to be held close, a culture to be celebrated, or a memory to make last. Rather, at Harvard, Kashmir is too comfortably scripted as a caricature of itself, rendered most legible when depictedas a site of violent occupation and extraordinary militarizationbut utterly unintelligible upon attempts to foreground enduring, everyday ways of life in the region. Indeed, I am disturbed by the overwhelming sense of spectacle that has become too readily invested in my Kashmiri identity — a sensation that I have been made to feel most acutely in South Asian spaces at Harvard, where I feel I have become a carrier of an exceptional legacy of suffering alone. I must note, I hardly intend to obscure the very real, embodied consequences of colonial violence and militarization that have shredded the fabric of everyday life in Kashmir. Instead, I hope to interrogate the conditions under which Kashmir is produced in the grammar of progressive and South Asian discourse at Harvard, bringing my homeland and my people into new and daring focus — even if it means lighting a match in my efforts to shed light. As a Kashmiri student, I inhabit a uniquely liminal position across affinity spaces at Harvard, stretched and suspended aimlessly across diverse South Asian cultural groups, organizing networks, and artistic productions. And it is a kind of tenuous, precarious condition that belongs widely to diasporic Kashmiri students, who — in theabsence of geopolitical legitimacyandinstitutional support for preserving Kashmiri culture and language— first interface with our identities through political encounters: through confrontation, through opposition, through anger. We are a deeply socialized ethnic minority: We learn to speak boldly about and bear witness to histories of injustice before we learn to speak our mother tongue. We learn what it means to resist and protest against occupation before we learn what it means to be Kashmiri itself — what it means to walk for Kashmir, for its liberation. Thus, we inherit a conception of our Kashmiri identities that is emptied of its cultural, symbolic, and affective textures and become grotesquely politicized, as if there is nothing but barbed wire that binds our people. We learn to rehearse the trite tropes that keep us visible at South Asian cultural showcases — of Kashmir as themost militarized region on the planet, as anoccupiedanddisputedterritory — and condemn to our collective amnesia the faces who fundamentally keep our people alive and movement aflame. We learn to forget, and we learn to be forgotten. It is in these fragmented moments that I remember my grandparents most vividly — how they indelibly continue to make life and break bread amid the impossibilities of everyday life. I recall the Kashmir they showed me to embrace, how they taught me to wear this identity with care, with spirit. At Harvard, though, this Kashmir is not palatable, not legible. What emerges, instead, is a cruel, diminishing narrative of Kashmir as a merely geopolitical space — as a land with no culture, no people. As a land of graves. However, in Kashmir, we say that our people live not in graves but in baghs, in gardens, inhabiting homes and everyday forms of life that flower between military encampments and fences. These gardens are pollinated by the histories and stories of their Kashmiri residents, who give new meaning and breathe new life into this profoundly militarized ecology. This is what liberation means to me: a framework that neither begins nor ends in politics, but with people. It is a liberation imagined in each blossoming bagh of Kashmir, in the hearts and hands of those like my grandparents. And it is a liberation we must be bold enough to dream. Sameer M.

crimson_2023_42,"In a statement on Nov. 9 broadcasting the formation of anantisemitism advisory group, University President Claudine Gay explained that she is committed to “protecting all members of our community from harassment and marginalization.” As Jewish students at Harvard, we recognize that our safety and protection do not exist in a vacuum. It cannot come at the expense of Palestinian wellbeing and freedom, neither here nor in Gaza. An immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and an end to what multiple experts have termed an ongoing genocide in Gaza are just first steps in building a safe and livable future for all people. AsRabbi Professor Shaul Magid writes, “in the intricate web that is the state of Israel, or Palestine, the well-being of one is dependent on the well-being of the other.” We unequivocally condemn Hamas’ attacks on Oct. 7. We are outraged by the mass murder committed on that day and every day since. However, in the wake of this violence, we are frustrated by the weaponization of Jewish grief to silence Palestinian and anti-Zionist voices, as well as to justify continued violence in Gaza and the West Bank. We have been so busy responding to this exploitation of grief — both at Harvard and globally — that we have not had time to contend with the magnitude of loss that we and our communities are grappling with. President Gay said in her speech announcing the creation of the advisory group that “the core of antisemitism is a lie — specifically the denial of Jewish identity and experience.” We agree. Our University has a responsibility to make clear that anti-Zionism is not antisemitism and that the conflation of the two makes it more difficult to identify and stand against real antisemitism. We call on President Gay and the advisory group to recognize the diversity of Jewish identities at Harvard and include anti-Zionist Jews in their work. As American Jewish activists, we are asked to make this distinction because it is often outright rejected when voiced by our Palestinian and peers of color. Charges of antisemitism must not be used to silence University affiliates expressing legitimate political criticism. This idea was echoed in astatement releasedthis week, with more than 100 Harvard faculty signatories arguing that “it cannot be ruled as ipso facto antisemitic to question the actions of this particular ethno-nationalist government.” Equating anti-Zionism with antisemitism also perpetuates violence against movements for liberation led by Palestinians and people of color. We echo the demands of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee in insisting that the Universityprotect free speechfor all students and create an “investigative committee on anti-Palestinian racism and the suppression of pro-Palestine voices.” This body should work in tandem with the antisemitism advisory group to address the shared root causes of antisemitism, racism, and Islamophobia: white supremacy and Christian hegemony. When we say “from the river to the sea,” we call for the freedom of all Palestinians from these oppressive systems and an end to the ongoing violence of the occupation. The focus on antisemitism on college campuses is a distraction from the horrors in Gaza. More than 11,000 Palestinians in Gazahave been killedsince Oct. 7, including at least 4,609 children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. That’s a death toll of 1 out of every 200 Gazans. Reports from the United Nations indicate that about1.5 million Palestinianshave been displaced — some for thesecond timein their lifetimes. Last month, Amnesty International documentedentire families in Gazawiped out by Israeli airstrikes. Two weeks ago, the Israeli military bombed the Jabalia refugee campat least six timesin one day, killing or injuring at least195 people. This week, the World Health Organization reported thatAl-Shifa hospital ceased functioningdue to days without electricity and water, further limiting access to healthcare. While these events unfold in Gaza, settlers in the West Bank are forcingPalestinians from their homes and lands. Our attention is there. In her remarks announcing the antisemitism advisory group, President Gay commented on Lech Lecha, the Torah portion in which God tells Abraham that he will “be a blessing.” President Gay saw this as a responsibility “to bring light, to each other and to the world,” and shared that this image resonated deeply with her. It does with us, too. Our responsibility to be a blessing means being in solidarity with all people facing oppression. We are proud to stand with Palestinians calling for their freedom and recognize that solidarity across religious, ethnic, and geographic lines is our only path forward. As members ofJews for Liberationat Harvard, we are creating the liberatory Jewish future we want to live in. We urge Harvard leadership to fulfill their promise to “be a forcefor something different and better” and join us in our intersectional movement for justice.

stanforddaily_2023_62,"I was glad to read President Saller and Provost Martinez’sdenunciationof the atrocities perpetrated by Hamas upon innocent Israeli citizens. They forcefully and unambiguously wrote in their Oct. 11 email to the Stanford community: As a moral matter, we condemn all terrorism and mass atrocities. This includes the deliberate attack on civilians this weekend by Hamas. One of the advances in international law in the 20th century following the horrors of the Holocaust was the development of international humanitarian law prohibiting war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Such crimes are never justified. Their statement aligns with the Oct. 10communicationof the Office of the United Nations Human Rights High Commissioner, with the key exception that the UN is even-handed in its application of international humanitarian law: The Commission has been collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes committed by all sides since Oct. 7, when Hamas launched a complex attack on Israel and Israeli forces responded with airstrikes in Gaza. Reports that armed groups from Gaza have gunned down hundreds of unarmed civilians are abhorrent and cannot be tolerated. Taking civilian hostages and using civilians as human shields are war crimes. The Commission is gravely concerned with Israel’s latest attack on Gaza and Israel’s announcement of a complete siege on Gaza involving the withholding of water, food, electricity and fuel which will undoubtfully cost civilian lives and constitutes collective punishment. Lest there be any ambiguity with regard tocollective punishment— “the prohibition of collective punishments is stated in the Hague Regulations and the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions.” Israel is heaping yet more suffering on the people of Gaza in order to punish Hamas. This act of collective punishment goes directly against the international humanitarian law that Saller and Martinez invoke to condemn Hamas. This collective punishment is being meted out against a captive population, 80% of whom arerefugees, 60% of whom areunder the age of 18. In 2010 British Prime Minister David Cameronreferredto Gaza as a “prison.” The Washington Post hasreportedthe death count of Israel’s collective punishment of Palestinian civilians — 1,537 killed, including 500 children and 276 women. Human Rights Watch hasreportedIsrael’s use of white phosphorus on the Palestinian population — “White phosphorus … has a significant incendiary effect that can severely burn people and set structures, fields and other civilian objects in the vicinity on fire. The use of white phosphorus in Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas in the world, magnifies the risk to civilians andviolates the international humanitarian law prohibition on putting civilians at unnecessary riskemphasis added .” The illegality of collective punishment takes place within an illegalblockadethat Israel has imposed for sixteen years, on top of an illegaloccupationwhich has been in existence since 1967. Since Saller and Martinez predicate their statement on international humanitarian law, let us see what it says about Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory. Not all occupations are illegal. There are settled conventions and protocols for how an occupying state must behave if it has placed a people and their land under occupation. The International Red Crossprovidesthis account: The duties of the occupying power are spelled out primarily in the 1907 Hague Regulations (art. 42-56 and the Fourth Geneva Convention (GC IV, art. 27-34 and 47-78 , as well as in certain provisions of Additional Protocol I and customary international humanitarian law… The main rules of the law applicable in case of occupation state that: Israel has violated each of these provisions. Let us simply go down the list: As far back as 2017, Israel passed a bill toannexPalestinian lands illegally, As a report from the BBCpointsout in its discussion of Israel’s annexation of Palestinian land, “Annexation is the term applied when a state unilaterally proclaims its sovereignty over other territory. It is forbidden by international law. A recent example was Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014.” On that basis if we condemn Russia’s annexation of Ukraine we should likewise condemn Israel’s annexation of Palestinian land, that is if we are to be morally consistent. Far from being “temporary,” theOccupationhas been in effect since 1967. Rather than ensuring the safety and well-being of those under its occupation, Israel has deprived (via its illegal blockade and is now in its actions of collective punishmentdeprivingthe civilian population of Gaza of hygiene, public health, food and medical care. Palestinians under occupation arenot triedin civil courts, but rather in military courts which deny basic constitutional rights to Palestinians, includingchildren, who are not only prevented from quickly obtaining legal representation, but also often from seeing their parents, sometimes for crimes as minuscule as throwing rocks at military vehicles. This suspension of legal protections and the abuse of minors is a form of hostage taking for the purposes of silencing protest and resistance. The unbridledappropriationof Palestinian property by Israeli settlers, armed and protected by the Israeli state, has existed for decades, but has increased exponentially under the rule of Israel’s far-right government, which tens of thousands of its own citizens have beenprotestingfor months precisely because of its attacks on the Israeli court system. While Israeli Jews have the right to protest when Netanyahu deprives them of their constitutional rights, Palestinians arebeaten, incarcerated and killed for protestingthe assault Israel has made on their lives and the rights guaranteed to them by international human rights law. To silence the monitoring of violations of international humanitarian law, Israel hasdeclaredcivil society human rights organizations “terrorist” organizations. To the grave concern of international law jurists itexpelledformer Stanford Law student Omar Shakir, who serves as Human Rights Watch’s director in Israel-Palestine. In condemning the egregious violations of international humanitarian law performed by Hamas, but not acknowledging those of the other protagonist in the conflict, the statement by the president and provost, at the same moment it declares the importance of maintaining the University’s “neutrality,” effectively exonerates the State of Israel. This makes it impossible for the Stanford community to have any discussion or debate on this topic — those critical of Israeli state policies already run the risk of being labeled “anti-Semites.” Saller and Martinez have made invisible precisely the basis for Palestinian claims to the rights guaranteed to them by international humanitarian law; they have exploited and desecrated the very law they use to advertise their moral goodness.

crimson_2023_151,"In a landmark decision, the Supreme Courteffectively endedrace-conscious affirmative action policies in college admissions, leaving Black students at Harvard and beyond contemplating the future of campus diversity. Regardless of one’s stance on the decision, diversity remains a vital, invaluable part of education. Therefore, in this inflective moment, Black students must take charge of their future, pursuing a racially diverse and more equitable campus. So far, Harvard’s apparent lack of planning for a post-affirmative action era is concerning. The University has not provided a comprehensive or public plan to address the Supreme Court decision. While legal constraints may have contributed to this silence, it is still essential for the University to stand alongside its students and take proactive measures to preserve student diversity. We need transparency and collaboration between the University and Black students to do that. However, the University is again silent here. It has been roughly six weeks since University administrators, including outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow and President-elect Claudine Gay, held an online listening session about theswatting incident on April 3. Harvard has failed to adequately safeguard the emotional and physical well-being of the Black community after this traumatic event. These communication issues are disappointing and point to a broader issue: Beyond the immediate challenges presented by the Supreme Court’s decision, we need to acknowledge and confront Harvard’s historical and present ties to harmful systems, from slavery to policing. While Harvard’sarguments about the educational benefitsof diversity reflect admirable and vital goals, the University often seems to ignore affirmative action’s place in a broader effort to reconcile with its legacy of white supremacy. Initiatives to rectify this legacy require our unwavering support, such asdenaming Winthrop House. The traditional, haphazard way of doing things at Harvard won’t work. The University’s approach to admissions has garnered sharp criticism from both the right and the left. For one, Harvard’salleged treatmentof Asian American applicants through mechanisms like personal ratings seems in some ways to have run afoul of the kind of holistic consideration of race previously approved by the Supreme Court. Secondly, touting race-conscious admissions as an effective means of promoting the success of underrepresented groups, as Harvard did,relies on predominantly white institutionsto uplift small numbers of minorities, perpetuating an inherently flawed system. This point is especially true in a college thatcontinues legacy preferences, skewing admissions in favor of wealthy and white students. In essence, Harvard has hidden behind existing practices because it has an interest in maintaining this system. For better or worse, the Supreme Court exposed it for doing so. We should have taken more significant steps long ago. Yes, Harvard thrives when students of various backgrounds and identities come together and learn from each other. Unfortunately, our University — indeed, all elite institutions —reward the wealthyand those who can afford to pay over opportunity for all. That feature reinforces our system, with Black people often bearing the brunt of its consequences. As an institution of higher learning — but also one that directly contributed to maintaining and defendingsystemic racismin the United States — Harvard bears the responsibility of fostering an inclusive, safe, and just environment for every member of its community. Its means may change, but the ends cannot. A clear path forward exists — one that calls for collective action, resilience, and the understanding that our education system often prioritizes capitalist values over social values. That responsibility includes us, too. After all, students shape the University’s mission. As Black students, we should build coalitions that challenge these flawed systems. Perhaps this means creating a Black Student Union in the spirit ofBlack campus organizations of the past. Today, we must continue their fight by supporting initiatives that address Harvard’s legacy of slavery and promote racial justice. In the wake of yesterday’s decision, Black students must recognize that the end of race-conscious admissions as we know them does not mean the end of our striving toward racial justice, diversity, and support. Now it is even more imperative to make this pursuit a reality. Clyve Lawrence ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Government concentrator in Adams House."
state_press_2023_39,"Last week, Turning Point USA unveiled its college ranking system called Dean s List. This list is based on only the most traditional hallmarks of a good university; TP USA says it was based on (presence of woke activist culture, racial discrimination, and hostility toward conservative students. And I should note, the racial discrimination they re talking about is toward white students. A University that receives an A on this list would be considered the ideal free speech paradise by the conservative organization. One that receives an F, however, might as well be openly communist. On a slightly more serious note, I think this list is incredibly helpful for the University as it points out exactly where we need to improve. I say the University should aim for an F — the lower, the better. ASU originally received a C- according to these standards, but the grade dropped to a D. I say, if the University wants to truly support its students and rise to the level of other academic institutions, we should aim low on the Turning Point scale. The site gives institutions overall grades as well as grades in individual categories. These categories range from things such as the average salary of recent graduates and the average amount of student debt all the way to things such as whether there is mandated diversity, equity and inclusion training and in-state tuition for undocumented students in Arizona. According to the website, the University received two As: one for having a TPUSA chapter and one for not having a bias response team. Two of the lower, more liberal rankings were an F for having mandated diversity, equity and inclusion training for staff and a D for having the same training be required for students —oh, the humanity. READ MORE:Barrett faculty petitions, condemns event featuring Dennis Prager and Charlie Kirk Anywhere the University got good marks should be seen as a potential area for improvement. For example, an area for improvement would be the University s harassment policy. The University defines harassment asa specific form of discrimination. It is unwelcome behavior, based on a protected status, which is sufficiently severe or pervasive as to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for academic pursuits, employment, or participation in university-sponsored programs or activities. According to the Dean s List, the University received a B rating for its harassment policy because it does not reach the strict standard of many other universities. Turning Point, of course, sees this as a good thing; after all, what s more patriotic than allowing harassment? I, however, don t. To that, I ask, why doesn t it meet the standard of other universities? What is the University not doing that makes its harassment policy fall below the standard of other colleges? The University of California, Riversidereceived a D for its harassment policyand an F overall.According to its website, UC Riverside defines harassment as conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so substantially impairs a person s access to University programs or activities that the person is effectively denied equal access to the University s resources and opportunities. UC Riverside also distinguishes between several categories of harassment such as conduct that is motivated on the basis of a person s race, color, national or ethnic origin, citizenship, sex, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identify, pregnancy, marital status, ancestry, service in the uniformed services, physical or mental disability, medical condition, or perceived membership in any of these classifications. Compared to ASU s harassment policy, this is much more defined and clear when it comes to what counts as harassment and what doesn t. Harassment thrives best in gray areas and vague definitions. This is clearly somewhere the University could improve, and it would not be hard to do so. A little more specificity could help get the policy to the standards of other universities. Another area in which the University could improve is adopting a bias response team. Currently, the University has no specific bias response team in place; instead, the Universitydirects students to file reportswith the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. According to the Dean s List, ASU received an A for its lack of a specific bias response team. Again, unsurprising; what s more quintessentially American than having no dedicated force that takes initiative to help someone who has experienced something traumatic like harassment? Compare this to UA,which received an F overall and an Ffor its adoption of a bias response team that specifically handles cases of potential harassment and discrimination against students. According to its website, UA s bias response team, BEST, provide(s care and support to impacted individuals, while also sending information that students provide in reports to the appropriate offices so that the cases can be handled. Compared to the University s lack of a bias response team, this seems much better. Victims of harassment and discrimination can have some support from the school while the response process occurs instead of waiting for their case to be heard out by the school with zero support leading up to it. These were just two among many other examples contained in the Dean s List of areas in which the University can improve. Call me a communist or a cultural Marxist; a D is good, but it needs to be an F. Edited by Kate Duffy, Reagan Priest, Piper Hansen, Greta Forslund and Luke Chatham.

thetech_mit_2023_9,"I am writing this after learning about allegations that David Spicer, the current UA President, was a member of a group of people who recently created and put up posters around campus which contained hateful speech and slurs against multiple marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ people, ethnic minorities, and women. As a queer, non-binary student, I have seen these posters and felt a kind of hurt I have not felt since coming to MIT. As a student leader, I am furious. Let’s start by talking about freedom of expression. In November 2022,The Techpublished an opinion column by Spicercriticizing the freedom of expression report, a report compiled by theAd Hoc Working Group on Free Expressionin June. The problem with this column is not solely that David’s argumentation is flimsy, taking some solid ideas and diluting them with poor writing and uncontextualized anecdotes, but that by tossing out such a document with seemingly minimal forethought, he diminishes the credibility of student governance as a whole. Instead of presenting a seasoned response to a report with genuine flaws, he presents half-baked arguments—such as complaints about the report’s length—allowing faculty members to assume that this is the best students can come up with in response. If this was the quality of Spicer’s contribution to the Ad Hoc Working Group, it is no wonder it was unpersuasive. Indeed, thereareproblems with the Freedom of Expression report, such as the failure to acknowledge the extent to which “time, place, and manner” restrictions may place different burdens on faculty, staff, and students; or the continued inconsistencies between its theoretical grounding in the First Amendment, which also protects anonymous speech, and current policy. These are problems thatthe reportfails to grapple with deeply, responding to a difficult scenario involving “conflict over student speech” by merely offering the option of more “viewpoint-neutral” restrictions, which seems to contradict the desire for additional free speech (p. 25 . And, Spicer’s actionsdoraise a question of whether these posters go beyond the “freedom from unreasonable and disruptive conduct ” promised to us by the Mind and Hand Book. None of these issues will be addressed so long as the person attempting to address them is David Spicer. More generally, the UA will continue to fail as a student advocacy organization so long as it is stuck in a mindset of “politics as point-scoring,” where the correct way to accomplish things is to make a lot of noise about issues whichsound likeissues we ought to be working on. I get it—saying that you worked on the “freedom of expression” policy at MIT sounds great. But by engaging in vigilantism, rather than putting in the actual legwork of building consensus on the subject with his constituents and the administration, he doomed his mission before it ever took off.In fact, the amount of active harm Spicer has done in the process of trying to accomplish his goal massively outweighs any benefit which could have been gained by students.This was already true before the posters—he has wasted hours “working” on the subject with senior administrators and the UA Council to no avail, time which could’ve been better spent addressing student-centered issues, such as food security or mental health—but it is undeniably true now. This hate speech hurts our communities, and damages the very individuals the UA is meant to serve. MIT has a strong history of student governance, and it is a tradition I am proud to be a part of. We know that, by working together, students and administrators can design initiatives and make decisions which can benefit both parties. This is the only reason students continue to have a seat at the table—it is because of the hard work of previous student leaders to maintain good relationships with administrators and win positive, feasible change along the way.It has not always been easy. Changes do not happen overnight. But, by working in good faith as collaborators tackling difficult issues, rather than as adversaries fighting for a particular cause,we can make a difference. When it comes, therefore, to leaders who seem to think that their particular issue is the most important one, and are not willing to engage collaboratively and in good faith with people with actual power—who must, sometimes, move slowly—we ought to reject them. The UA Council has voted to trigger a recall election for David Spicer, and I thank them for their service. I urge him to step down and apologize to the groups he has hurt, but, barring that, I urge my fellow undergraduates to vote ‘yes’ on recalling him when the ballot opens. More importantly, however, I urge the incoming UA leadership to consider this tale a cautionary one; that is, not just a dismissable outlier, but rather a painful and important lesson to take your job seriously, to earn respect from administrators and faculty rather than demand it, and to work with the institution in a manner whichdirectlybenefits the undergraduates they represent. This kind of myopia has no place at our school, much less our student government. Alan Zhu is a fourth-year undergraduate studying Creative Writing and Computer Science.

crimson_2023_15,"There’s no denying that a Harvard degree holds significant value in the job market. This much is evident from the impressive starting salaries and high immediate post-graduation employment rates of Harvard graduates. If a college is to derive its value from the financial success of its graduates, then Harvard is doing a stellar job. But most of us probably agree that a college education should encompass far more than that. If we factor out career outcomes, how much are students getting out of their Harvard education? Are our four years here really the “transformative experience” that the College so proudly advertises? Harvard’s strongculture of careerismis well documented, but that has not always been the case. Throughout its early history, Harvard placed a significant emphasis on providing a classical education, emphasizing liberal arts disciplines like Ethics and Politics, Metaphysics and Theology, and Rhetoric and Logic as a core part of the curriculum. Why, hundreds of years later, does this feel missing from our education at the very same institution? It’s not that one can’t find personal fulfillment in the subjects Harvard offers today. Still, it’s impossible not to notice that the College’s early focus seemed clearly centered around intellectual enrichment rather than career development, as we see now. This careerist bent has real consequences for students. Whether we like it or not, we live, breathe, and eat in an environment where professional and financial success is equated to life success or ‘living well.’ For many undergraduates, the pressure of scoring a high-paying job immediately out of graduation reduces classes and extracurriculars to nothing more than strategic and competitive resume building. Rather than spending their college years discovering themselves, students become trapped in a relentless pursuit for professional success, oftentimes seeming to forget about the very real passions and interests that brought them to Harvard in the first place. People easily abandon their genuine interests, forfeiting some of their identity in the process. As I reflect on the evolution of Harvard’s educational character, I find myself yearning for a return to the University’s classical roots. While the demands of the modern age necessitate some degree of professional development opportunities, we have allowed careerism to overshadow our commitment to encouraging intellectual curiosity and instilling a sense of social and ethical responsibility. Harvard should be a place where students inspire and learn from each other — not seek to outperform one another. Integrity, creativity, and commitment to the greater good should be the qualities we look for in ourselves and each other, not our capacity to earn money and our desirability as labor inputs. What can Harvard do to turn the tide, not just for its own students but also as a leading institution in higher education? One important move would be to bring back elements of Harvard’s past curriculum. Required philosophy, ethics, and humanities courses, beyond the current sparse General Education and distributional requirements, could help nurture personal enrichment in students alongside professional development. These classes would collectively offer a partial version of the classical education that was once standard at Harvard. To be clear, this does not mean adding significant academic burdens to students. These classes do not have to be difficult to be useful. Courses like the popular General Education 1025: “Happiness” show the way forward on this front. Harvard should also expand its curricular breadth by offering more interdisciplinary concentrations, like Social Studies and History & Literature, that allow students to explore different fields. These kinds of concentrations seem most likely to open novel intellectual pathways for students rather than confining them within narrow disciplines, helping to foster intellectual curiosity more generally. Harvard has the opportunity to redefine what a high-quality college education looks like in this country — to become a pioneer and inspiration for its peers across higher education. It should renew its commitment to a truly liberal arts education, and that starts by gearing our academics toward personal enrichment. Lauren H. Kim ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Government concentrator in Eliot House."
stanforddaily_2023_74,"I was pleased to see that theProvostial Search Committeehad representation from the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholar communities. I was one of the voicescalling for that representation. At the risk of being accused of moving the goalposts, I do take issue with how the selection occurred. At theSURPAS Councilmeeting on May 25, we learned that the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs nominated a few postdocs to the committee. Those postdocs were then interviewed behind closed doors to choose the one person who would represent our community. It is a funny form of shared governance where the elected representatives of the postdoctoral community (SURPAS did not get the opportunity to choose who will fill the important role of helping select a new Provost. I have no doubt Dr. Robert M. Stolz will do an excellent job of making sure the new Provost is someone who understands the important role postdocs play in our university and is responsive to our needs as a community. One does not become a postdoc at Stanford unless they are brilliant, driven, thoughtful, and deeply knowledgeable about academia. Further, the issues facing the postdoctoral community are cross-cutting and deeply felt as demonstrated in the recentSURPAS Long Range Planning Report. But there is a benefit to representatives on committees being engaged with community structures that provide institutional knowledge, which I will illustrate with a story. This is a tale told to me by someone who served on a search committee to fill a role in the university administration. I have been at Stanford long enough that the individuals involved can remain in a haze of anonymity granted by the passage of the sands of time. They have moved on from the institution and the possibility of career repercussions. This search committee had one graduate student and one postdoc, neither of whom had official voting rights. One of the early career committee members had heard that someone on the shortlist had a toxic lab environment. The graduate student and postdoc representatives said that if they had any veto power (which they didn’t officially , they would strike that candidate from the list. To their credit, the faculty members on the search committee were responsive and did not move forward with consideration of that candidate. That is why everyone was so shocked that the person who had apparently been stricken from consideration was the person who got the job. The faculty-led search committee with early career representatives was a facade and a waste of everyone’s time. With all the attention being paid to the Provostial Search Committee and the importance of the role for our institution, I have no doubt that the current committee will be deliberate, thoughtful, and anything but a show committee. But transparency is not guaranteed. Dr. Stolz, I hope you will engage with already existing self-organized postdoc organizations like SURPAS or thePostdoc Affinity Groupsto ensure all voices from the postdoctoral community can have a say in the selection process and to keep us updated as possible. Thank you for your commendable willingness to step up to serve our institution and community. Trust your judgment and make your voice heard representing postdocs and other committee members that do not have the same power as faculty or administration. Tim MacKenzie, Ph.D. has been a member of the Stanford Community since arriving to start his Ph.D. in Chemistry in 2013. He currently works as a postdoc in the Department of Genetics.

crimson_2023_147,"When footage of the murder of George Floyd began to circulate on social media in 2020, I remember feeling distraught. A part of me knew what I was going to witness by watching the video — the trauma of seeing someone that looked like my loved ones killed in broad daylight. But what I didn’t realize was that I would be faced with rage not just against systemic racism, but also against a part of my own identity. As the left knee of Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, remained wedged against Floyd’s neck, Tou Thao, a Hmong officer, stood idle. According to footage of the incident, Thao motioned to bystanders to stay away from him and his colleagues while two other police officers restrained Floyd. I am of both Black and Asian descent. At that moment, I felt betrayed by Thao. It felt confusing that someone of color could be blind to their standing in society — blind to the fact that they will never be proximate to whiteness. I felt uneasy in grappling with this tension not just within my own identity, but between two communities that I was a part of. In the past few years, I have noticed a shift in the air regarding the standing of those of Asian descent in conversations of race. The murder of George Floyd, the growing number ofviolent crimes against Asian Americansin the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Supreme Court hearing in October about the use ofaffirmative actionby higher education institutions have all brought to the forefront the complicated nature of what it means to be Asian American. Within this realization, the historical tension between Asian and Black communities in the United States has been revisited. But in moments of division, we must remind ourselves of our history of shared solidarity, because that solidarity is an essential foundation for recognizing our common enemy: white supremacy. The tension between Black and Asian Americans did not start with George Floyd and Tou Thao. The murder of Floyd echoes a pivotal event in this history: theLos Angeles Riots of 1992. On March 3, 1991, Rodney King, a Black man, was brutalized by a group of police officers in Los Angeles. Like Floyd’s, his interaction with police was documented on video, and similarly brought to the surface generations worth of frustration towards our nation’s law enforcement and justice system. That same month, Latasha Harlins, a 15-year-old Black girl, was shot in a small corner store. The owner — a Korean woman — said Harlins was attempting to shoplift, and that she felt endangered enough to shoot her for self-defense. Instantly, the streets of Los Angeles were flooded with protests for the deaths of both Harlins and King. In response, other Korean store owners armed themselves against Black rioters, initiating an unspoken racial standoff. As time went on, this animosity was passed on from generation to generation in both communities, and racist notions of the other began to solidify. During the pandemic, this history has been leveraged against the Black and Asian communities. Because some of the recent crimes against Asian Americans were committed by Black people, some observers intentionally tried to reduce the situation to an exaggerated Black and Asian divide, intentionally ignoring the epidemics of xenophobia and white supremacy that had brought our nation to that point. But the fragmented relationship between my two communities has seen occasional glimpses of healing. During the Black Power movement,Yuri Kochiyama and Malcolm Xstood allied, supporting each other’s struggles for civil rights. Seconds after Malcolm X’s assassination, Kochiyama held his head in her lap. And at a2021 Black & Asian Solidarity rallyin New York City, protesters called out acts of Asian hate in response to Covid-19 while holding up picket signs saying “Black Lives Matter.” Together and unified, individuals chanted: “Show me what community looks like. This is what community looks like!” At this rally, members of my two communities were able to acknowledge their differing experiences with race in America. This approach not only respects the privileges that one has over the other, but prevents us from equating the difficulties of the Asian American experience to the Black experience. From America’s sin of slavery to its xenophobic immigration policies, both the Asian and Black communities have faced and continue to face our nation’s white supremacist roots. Instead of continuing a pattern of complacency, it is time that we acknowledge the true fight at hand — together. The struggles of Asian American and Black communities in America are certainly not interchangeable. But both struggles derive from the same system — a system that continues to thrive off our division. In the words of activist Frannie Lou Hamer: “Nobody’s free until everybody’s free.” Lauren A. Kirkpatrick ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Thayer Hall.

stanforddaily_2023_23,"First impressions matter. My first impression of the workings of The Stanford Daily was not propitious. When I sought to join the staff early in winter quarter of my freshman year, I was assigned to do a piece on Stanford’s mausoleum, the shrine to its namesake, Leland Stanford Jr., where he and his parents, the university’s founders, are buried. I went there in the rain, took my soggy notes back to the office, sat down at the latest technological innovation — an electric typewriter — wrote the piece and turned it over to the news editor. A day or two later, I called, wondering why it hadn’t appeared. The editor hemmed, hawed, then said, “Umm, we lost it. (Long pause. Can you redo it?” I said a few unprintable things, sat down and rewrote it; it was published a day later. The first lesson in journalism provided by The Daily: journalists are fallible. Over the coming months, I realized journalists are also essential. Stanford was bursting at the seams with anger. The root causes were one, the Vietnam War and Stanford’s work on military research and two, racism. Over the years anti-war demonstrations turned increasingly violent; a tenured faculty member found to have incited one was eventually dismissed. And racist incidents, on campus and off, led to simmering fury among students of color. Accurate reporting on issues fraught with emotion was essential. In the maelstrom, I learned more about how to find facts, evaluate them and reflect a variety of viewpoints than any classroom could have taught. I also learned how to meet deadlines (sort of . And if I hadn’t had to face angry students, or the lawyers for students trying to block stories, or demonstrators wanting to control the narrative of the news, I would have been less equipped in later years to cover Washington or Moscow for the Washington Post and The New York Times. For all the emotional events I covered — and the lighter features and commentary I used to paint a picture of Stanford culture — there were two overriding events, for me and for The Daily. First was the lawsuit that gave The Daily a permanent place in the laws of the United States. Second, the decision by the University and The Daily to arrange an amicable separation, leaving The Daily an independent publication two years after my editorship. The lawsuit began for me when I was returning from an April class in English Restoration literature and was greeted at the door of the Storke Student Publications building by a top editor saying, “They had a search warrant. There was nothing I could do.” Several Santa Clara County Sherriff’s deputies were looking through our desks and our photo files, seeking pictures of assaults on police officers who were clearing student protestors out of a medical building. That was in April 1971. We brought a lawsuit trying to prohibit police searches of newspaper offices. It failed in the Supreme Court, but Congress subsequently enshrined the protections into federal law. The push for The Daily’s independence was something I supported; the heavy lifting was done by others. For me, the essential principle was eliminating the threat of censorship or control by the University. Not too long ago, that threat reemerged as a lower-level official threatened Daily journalists if they published secret information. The independent newspaper stood strong; the threat evaporated. My Daily experiences were integral to my entire career as a journalist. They were integral to something else. The editor in chief I first worked with — not the editor who lost my mausoleum story — has been my husband for 51 years. We’ve been to many places but have never forgotten where we came from. Felicity Barringer ’72 was the Vol. 159 editor in chief of The Daily. She went on to report for the Washington Post and The New York Times."
ubyssey_2023_10,"Sept. 26, 2023 Written byIman Janmohamed Hi Iman, UBC is huge and overwhelming, so how do I find friends on campus? Making friends is scary! But just because it’s scary, doesn’t mean it’s impossible. I know it’s something you’ve heard a million times over, but you have to put yourself “out there” to make friends. What does “out there” mean, though? It means going to class and chit-chatting with the person beside you. It means joining a club and actually going to events. And it means hanging out with others on your dorm floor when your RA hosts an event. If you don’t give yourself the opportunity to make friends by opening yourself up, then you won’t be able to do it! Campus is huge, and like you said, overwhelming. But you’ve got to remember one thing — everyone is in the same boat. It’s a cliché, but, it’s true. Everyone is just as nervous as you are, and everyone wants to make friends, be loved and have a sick college friend group that does everything together and has a ton of fun and works at the campus radio station and maybe is part of an acapella group and wait I’m just explainingPitch Perfect.

crimson_2023_110,"When Iheard the newsthat the former president of Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative transferred $30,000 from the club’s bank account to her own, I laughed. $30,000 seems like an astronomical amount of money for a single individual to access in an instant. With that amount of money, an undergraduate could buy enough takeout ramen, burritos, and iced vanilla lattes to fuel all four years at Harvard. But, putting tasty snacks aside, $30,000 is equivalent to the annual income of a family of four living at the national poverty line. With this realization, my laughter faltered. I go to a school where a teenager or twenty-something year-old can unilaterally control more money than some families see in an entire year. Most Harvard students will argue that the HUFPI situation is atypical. Only some student organizations have as much money or power as HUFPI, and the optimistic undergraduate might even argue that their peers could handle such responsibility. But while these points might be true to an extent, the existence of even a single story like this illustrates an important reality about the culture of student organizations at Harvard: They’re usually centered around control. Even though we don’t like directly recognizing it, this theme comes up often in high-profile on-campus news events and whispered gossip. After the Undergraduate Council was defunded amid allegations of financial irresponsibility, the Harvard Undergraduate Association proposed an(ultimately unsuccessful amendmentto its constitution so that the position of “Co-President” would be renamed “Co-Coordinator.” This move was apparently made to reduce the prestige associated with the role and select individuals motivated by passion rather than aspirations of a career in government. Besides this well-publicized example, many of my friends have complained to me about leadership issues in their clubs. A classmate told me that one of their collaborators refused to share the login to a club’s bank account, preventing them from planning essential events. Another peer told me their club suddenly instituted a hierarchical leadership structure after years of being unstructured. The common thread here is that many Harvard students want to be in control of their clubs, even if they don’t want to admit it. Maybe you have an impulse to point fingers at the megalomaniacs engaging in hostile takeovers and controlling leaders monopolizing power, but I would bet that doing so would lead you to run out of fingers pretty quickly. Besides, this ignores the issue at the heart of this story: Harvard doesn’t inherently have too many students pursuing power over passion. Rather, the University is a breeding ground for this kind of mentality. Extracurriculars aren’t treated as a reprieve from the day-to-day stressors of being a college student. Instead, time outside of class is measured in bullet points on a resume. Participation in a student organization must have tangible benefits, whether those be building a useful network, developing pre-professional skills, or beefing up a CV. This mindset creates a culture where control and “leadership experience” are prized above passion. Tragically, this “leadership experience” is mostly tainted. The pressure to engage in a large number of clubs rather than dedicate quality time to just a couple can cause ineffective leadership. Many clubs have hierarchical structures with a single person at the top. Demanding leadership roles can make participation logistically challenging for first-generation, low-income students whomust balance work with extracurriculars. For students who do lead clubs, the responsibilities take up significant time and emotional bandwidth. At the most extreme end of the spectrum, enterprising individuals may use their unchecked power to makefantastically horrible decisionsthat ultimately harm their own future and the future of their organizations. If you are keeping a tally of the ingredients that make up student life at Harvard, you may have noticed by now that “fun” is missing from the list. Believe it or not, these conditions are not conducive to fulfillment or enjoyment — but you should not write this off as an individualistic problem. We need to radically restructure the clubs that exist. It’s not enough to make symbolic gestures; a co-coordinator doing the job of a president might as well retain the title. I would argue that few clubs, if any at all, need a hierarchy. A board of individuals can divide responsibilities and lead as effectively as a single person. Restructuring clubs in this way would allow students to engage specifically with an aspect of an organization, reduce the barrier to entry, and decrease the pressure to control a club or hold the position of president. The checks and balances of group decision-making also decrease the chances that anyone could single-handedly control an amount of money equivalent to the annual income of a family. Most importantly, these changes could drive a cultural shift towards focusing on activities that spark passion and joy rather than strengthen sections of a resume — and hopefully bring back fun to a campus that desperately needs it.

crimson_2023_54,"Coming from South Korea, where intensely law-abiding citizens do not dare to set foot on the road before the pedestrian light turns green, the norm of jaywalking in Harvard Square took some time to adjust to. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to learn that despite its supposedly disruptive effects, for some urban planners, ubiquitous jaywalking signals success at prioritizing pedestrians over vehicles. This difference is one of many I have noticed about urban living in Cambridge. A myriad of unfamiliar systems of public transit, streets, and buildings in this new environment left me fascinated by the culture-specific nature of urban design. For an undecided freshman scrambling to explore potential concentrations, fascination meant opportunity — an opportunity to explore the field of urban studies. But amidst the scramble of course registration, I was confused to learn that Urban Studies was not among the 50 concentrations and 49 secondaries offered at the College. It is time for Harvard to establish an Urban Studies department. Urban studies epitomizes Harvard’s interdisciplinary mission. As a student ina first-year seminar about the subject, I’ve learned about topics ranging from symbols of power and fascism in Nazi architecture to the tensions between environmental activism and public housing projects. These ideas transcend departmental boundaries and connect seemingly unrelated corners of society, embodying the liberal arts education that Harvard promises to offer. Urban studies is also at the core of the most pressing socioeconomic and environmental problems that Harvard is committed to addressing — particularly the climate crisis. Sustainable urban design is fundamental to reducing our buildings’ carbon footprint, planning green spaces, and making green transportation options available. A comprehensive response to the climate crisis requires urban planning as an integral part of Harvard’s agenda. In light of the glaring relevance of this field, every college in the Ivy League offers urban studies as a major or minor — every college, that is, except Harvard. Outside of urban planning and design programs at the Graduate School of Design, the Harvard Mellon Urban Initiative and the Bloomberg Center for Cities seem to support urban studies on the broader campus. However, these resources lack the centralization or accessibility to undergraduates of a full department. HMUI supports “public events, exhibitions, course activities, community engagement, and workshops,” while BCC primarily focuses on research, training, and collaboration with city leaders. Both are a far cry from conventional academic departments that offer dedicated faculty, classes, and degrees for undergraduates. Demand for undergraduate urban studies education certainly exists at Harvard. In recent years, a group of students formed the Harvard Undergraduate Urban Sustainability Lab as a hub for urban studies on campus, and others have crafted their own special concentrations to pursue the field. Special concentrations have often been a preliminary step to establishing an academic department at Harvard: Dramatic studies and global health were popular topics for special concentrators before the advent of the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration and Global Health and Health Policy secondary. Harvard can meet a similarly unmet academic need with an Urban Studies concentration or secondary. While the argument for an Urban Studies department may sound strange coming from a student considering many concentrations, that is precisely the point. For someone like me, whose interests are somewhat scattered, the lack of an Urban Studies department eliminates the possibility of pursuing the subject at all. College should be a place where students get to tap into every bit of curiosity they have for a field of study. Undergraduates should not have to rule out potential interests because of the school’s lack of available concentration pathways — especially at a college like Harvard, which prides itself on its academic resources. Harvard should support students wishing to explore the ever-relevant subject of urban studies. Doing so will enhance students’ understanding of the liberal arts, equip them with tools to resolve grave threats to sustainability and quality of life — and teach them to feel less ashamed the next time they jaywalk.

stanforddaily_2023_58,"These past three weeks have been, for me, the most stressful and painful weeks since I came to Stanford with my family in 2021. I grew up in Israel and lived there my entire life; my parents were born in the United States, which has always felt like a second home to me. The past three weeks of living here while keeping an alarmed, watchful eye on what is happening in Israel and Gaza — friends and family members agonizing and bereaving — have taught me a great deal about my place in the Stanford community. I discovered that the people whom I thought were sensitive, moral and thoughtful have chosen to remain silent in the wake of a dreadful war and the atrocities against my people. What I am referring to is hardly just my own personal feeling, but something that many of my Israeli friends on campus have experienced these past weeks. In the wake of the horrific events of Oct. 7 — namely, Hamas’ killing, rape and kidnapping of Israeli civilians in what has been considered the deadliest day in Jewish history since 1945 — what we had hoped to get from our peers and classmates was support and empathy. Some of us did receive that, and I cherish my friends and colleagues who reached out to me and proved that friendships can overcome ideological differences. Still many others were, and are, silent. These are people we go to class with, people we sit for coffee with, people to whom we nod every morning when we go to our labs or to our joint working spaces — and they have said nothing, offered no condolences and didn’t even check in. There were other smaller disappointments along the way. This newspaper, which I admire and read closely,rana piece about a case involving a lecturer who, allegedly, made some disturbing remarks towards Jewish and Israeli students in class. The Stanford Daily, always keen on getting to the bottom of things, investigated the case, interviewed students whorefutedthe original account (which has since been picked up by nearly every media outlet in the United States and was sure to include quotes about the wonderful and beloved lecturer. Imagine, for a moment, a semi-sympathetic piece written about a professor who berates an Asian American student in class. It is unimaginable. While it is always important to thoroughly examine what is happening on campus, one cannot escape the sense that some stories are automatically believed and supported, while other stories — in this case, a story involving Jewish and Israeli students — are doubted, questioned and countered. Then came the demonstrations. A demonstration on Friday, Oct. 20, included blatant, hateful speech, which explicitly called for an intifada, a violent resistance against Israelis. I should emphasize the fact that though I am writing this text in the (relative comfort and safety of Green Library, had my children and I flown from San Francisco to Israel for the weekend of Oct. 7 to visit family or friends in the Negev, near Gaza, we would most likely have been killed or abducted. A speaker at the demonstration, who identified as an “anti-Zionist Jew,” supported the atrocious acts of a militant group which the United States, the EU, Germany, Great Britain, Jordan and Egypt, among others, have denounced as a terrorist organization. Quite simply, they are supporting the killing and abduction of myself and my family. The speaker then moved on to indicate that it may be time to carry weapons on campus as well. The audience gleefully cheered. “Long live the intifada,” some of them yelled. This cannot be tolerated. No student should be walking around campus and hearing chants supporting the killing of their family. No faculty member should have to endure calls for an armed resistance against their loved ones. And, as members of the Stanford community, none of us should feel unsafe. Some people — too many, unfortunately — think that a clear and forceful condemnation of the heinous acts carried out by Hamas necessarily contradicts a vehement support of the Palestinian cause. These people demand that we pick sides — either you express your sorrow and shock over the evil, blood-thirsty slaughter of1,400innocent people, or you join forces with those who advocate for equality and self-determination in Israel and Palestine. This binary is false. Nothing in the world can justify Hamas’ monstrous crimes, and those who consider themselves moral people should stop and seriously think why is it that they are unable to condemn these crimes. I believe that one can wholeheartedly stand with Palestine and simultaneously acknowledge the horrific murder of innocent people in Israel. Contrary to what the extremists here and elsewhere are positing, decent and moral people can and must hold these views at the same time. My cards on the table: I am an Israeli leftist. I have opposed the policies of the Israeli government since the day I started reading about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which I have done extensively since I was a teenager. I support the end of the occupation and the self-determination of Palestinians, and I am deeply saddened and appalled by the devastating sights coming from Gaza right now, where thousands of innocent people are killed and hundreds of thousands are fearing for their lives. I have spent a good portion of my academic and writing career reading about my neighbors, trying to understand their pain and cultivating ways of thinking of a better future. This is how I raise my children, too — I explain to them that Israel and Palestine are the home of two peoples who must find ways, against all odds, to live together. The demonstration on campus was not calling for co-existence, but the eradication of Jewish existence in the region. That was Hamas’ self-proclaimed attempt on Oct. 7. That is Hamas’ objective, as stated in the Hamas Covenant. That is, inconceivably, what the radical, vocal pro-Palestinian voices on campus are expressing. We should stop and reflect on the shallow and distortive rhetoric that is being used. More importantly, we should stop and consider the human beings who work and live beside us, and the fact that they too have pains, feelings, dreams, convictions and hopes.

stanforddaily_2023_102,"This article is the first of a three-part series on how the Stanford community can revive social life on campus. This first piece covers Greek life, and will be followed by articles on sexual violence prevention and administrative reform. After the slogan “Fun Strikes Back”dominated pollsin the recent ASSU election, student support for the rebellious movement of “Stanford Hates Fun” has seemingly peaked — but where do we go from here? Sophia Danielpour ‘24 and Kyle Haslett ‘25 were recently elected Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU Executives, with the goal of recovering the fun that Stanford has lost. Their victory comes nearly a year after the Palladiumarticlethat started it all, “Stanford’s War on Social Life,” in which the author Ginevra Davis casts Stanford’s administration as a bulwark to the vivacity of post-pandemic campus culture. The Palladium article’s strongest grievance is with the University’s crackdown on the “hubs of student life”: namely, “fraternities and cultural theme houses.” This, along with wistful anecdotes about fraternities of yore, erroneously implies a fundamental link between the restoration of Greek life on campus and the revival of Stanford’s formerly legendary student culture. While Greek life surely plays a part, Stanford’s social life has a great deal more to offer. With rush wrapping up and new pledges selected, fraternities and sororities have been very active as of late. “Abolish Greek Life” (AGL , on the other hand, has had an extremely quiet year, resulting in fewer conversations about the harms of Greek life. Hopes for Stanford’s social life have increasingly been pinned on fraternities, which host the majority of all-campus parties. Before 2021, dorm RAs often told residents that drinking in dorms was tolerated if they left their room doors open. But the Stanford Office of Student Affairs publisheda new alcohol policy in 2021, which put an end to Stanford’s unofficial pre-pandemic “open-door drinking policy.” Drinking culture therefore became centered on the Row, naturally leading to the perception of the Row as the only place on campus where you’ll hear bumping music and rowdy partygoers. In addition to throwing parties, Greek life is regarded as a space where students can find and build community, especially where theneighborhood systemhas failed to do so. Greek life is rife with networking opportunities — that is, if you can get in. De facto systems like “dirty rushing” involve members of a Greek organization selectively recruiting (and essentially bribing potential new members with gifts and favors — and, as you can imagine, these selected individuals likely have existing ties to the organization or other advantages. While Greek life surely contributes to a segment of the social scene at Stanford, there are serious harms to idealizing Greek life and fraternities in particular. Although diversity statistics are not available, it is evident through observation and talking to members of Greek organizations that much of Greek life remains more white, wealthy and well-connected than the average Stanford student; the membership fees stacking up to hundreds of dollars per quarter are enough to drive some students away. Even more pertinent is the issue of safety. In 2020, a Stanford student died from a drug overdose inTDXfraternity. In 2015, Brock Turner assaulted an unconscious woman after a party at Kappa Alpha, which led to widespread reckoning with sexual violence relating to frat parties and Stanford more generally. In the2019 survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct, 29% of undergrad/coterm women who experienced cases of penetration by force and 18% of undergrad/coterm women who experienced cases of sexual touching by force reported meeting their perpetrator at a fraternity house. Frat houses are therefore hubs of sexual violence on campus, compounded by the fact that all-campus Greek events are hosted exclusively at fraternity houses, since sororities are not allowed to host parties or have men in their residential area — policies that point to Greek life’s misogynistic roots. To their credit, many fraternities are not ignoring the issue. Members of Phi Psi, Sig Ep and Sig Chi showed out to “Take Back the Night,” an annual event to raise awareness of and confront sexual violence on campus. If you want to enter a frat party, you must read out a sign that describes and agrees to adhere to the principles of consent in the house. All fraternities have introduced Violence Intervention and Prevention members, and each event is meant to be attended by sober monitors. In good faith that these measures are sincere and not merely performative, we support the above initiatives as well as the introduction of DEI chairs in all Greek organizations and other efforts to make Greek life more inclusive. In order to promote a safer and more diverse Greek social scene, we encourage housed fraternities to additionally: We should also create and maintain social hubs separate from Greek life to diversify the range of events on campus and reduce dependence on fraternities, thereby creating a more sustainable social ecosystem. In addition toexistingdiscoursearound how Stanford can facilitate fun, we advocate for the following changes: These suggestions are only a start, and can only form part of the solution. Ultimately, it is our individual actions that collectively define our campus culture. Each of us, as Stanford students, can choose to be open-hearted and spontaneous; to express ourselves, to be generous to friends and strangers, and to seize small pockets of joy and create them for others.

Through Nov. 3, you can head to theTexas Medical Centerto cast your ballot — and starting Saturday, Rice will provide bus service from campus. If you can’t make it by then, Sewall Hall will be a voting precinct for Election Day on Nov. 7. Houston’s next set of elected officials will inherit the complex issues the city faces today, ranging from public safety to unemployment, potholes, transit and homelessness. The largely Democratic city also faces immense political pressure from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s administration. The Texas Education Agency recentlytook overthe board of the Houston Independent School District, turning someschool librariesinto de-facto detention rooms, and Abbott continues to cynicallytargetelection administration in Harris County. The stakes are high. Will Houston, the fourth-largest city in the country, adjust to itsexplosive population growth, or will its infrastructure give out? Will crime continue to decrease? Will the city build on its progressmoving people off the streets? Will a proposedlight rail linkto Hobby Airport come to fruition? Will Main Street and Rice Boulevard get their potholes repaired? The future of Rice is irrevocably intertwined with Houston. Rice can only afford so many power losses, boil water notices and guns on the street. Our cars can only take so many of those violent bumps. On the mayoral side, incumbent Sylvester Turner is term-limited, with 18 candidates vying to replace him. The two leading candidates are household names in Houston: John Whitmire, a 40-year Texas State Senator from North Houston, and Sheila Jackson Lee, who has represented downtown Houston in the U.S. Congress since 1995. If your Texas voter registration address is on campus, you will also vote for the city council member fromDistrict C, where incumbent Abbie Kamin is facing two challengers. All Houstonians will cast a ballot for the five at-largecouncil members. There are two incumbents and 26 other candidates. Finally, there arelocalandstatewideballot propositions regarding hospitals for low-income and uninsured Houstonians, government operations, funding for public education and more. In other words, you, a Houston voter, have a lot of decisions to make. Even if this election season may not have the attention of next year’s presidential election, the issues at hand are just as important. Luckily, there is a plethora of information out there. This week, take 30 minutes to research the candidates and propositions and write down your choices. Head to the polls and make your voice heard. The future of Houston — and of Rice — depends on it.

crimson_2023_78,"In this year’s Super Bowl, two Black quarterbacks, Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts, led their teams to face off for a championship. Before them, only six Black quarterbacks had ever started a championship game in NFL history. Although this achievement may seem trivial, Mahomes and Hurts are doing a lot more for the Black community than just playing sports. Quarterback is one of the most well-respected and glorified positions in football, which is shown by the fact that their salaries are often two or three times higher than their teammates. Watching so many inspiring athletes on TV, I realized that sports can be a unique and efficient medium for Black activists to utilize. Why? Firstly, Black people stand out on the field in ways they often cannot in other spaces. There are examples of Black success in politics, music, art, and education, but in the sports arena, the public cannot turn away and ignore what we have to say. Black people create the revenue. Black people have the power. Activism always comes with risk, but athletic power often makes it so we can have a voice without facing quite as severe consequences. Black athleticism begins with people like Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who raised their fists during the national anthem after winning Olympic medals in 1968. They did this in protest of racism around the country, shortly after the death of Martin Luther King Jr. At this moment, Smith and Carlos earned everyone’s attention, and their protest is still widely remembered today. There are more contemporary examples as well. LeBron James, a Black athlete, is arguably the best basketball player of all time. LeBron was allowed to kneel during his games, and wear Black Lives Matter t-shirts freely, perhaps because the NBA knew they would suffer without him. Football player Colin Kaepernick also kneeled in protest of the national anthem, but paid the price for it, eventually losing his job; he is still working to be on a team again. Despite this personal cost, Kaepernick made a significant impact — we will never forget his name, and his actions reverberated far beyond his own fate. Secondly, athletes’ relatability and accessibility give them the power to fuel activism in Black youth who watch sports. Many Black boys today want to be football and basketball players at least in part because those leagues give them the representation they need. They believe that they can be great because they see people who look like them doing great things. Because of their platform, athletes have the chance to be role models for children watching, not just sports idols. LeBron James grew up in a single-parent household and in poverty, and faced a lot of difficulties in his youth. Because of this, he learned how to save and didn’t indulge in many materialistic things, educating Black kids and his younger peers about budgeting and money management. James also built a school in Akron, Ohio, to support at-risk kids, funded by his personal foundation. In addition, he has managed to largely avoid scandals, proving to be a great role model to those who admire him. Through his character, his actions, and his activism, LeBron does a lot more for young Black kids beyond just playing basketball. The Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, are also great examples of Black role models in the world of professional sports. Richard Williams, their father, became famous for the way he raised his daughters to be stars, with discipline and determination. Serena and Venus Williams display unwavering confidence, even while playing professional tennis at a very young age. I have noticed the rise of young Black women in tennis, like Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka, because the Williams sisters inspired them to believe that they could make it too. Black athletes can make change on the collegiate level as well. Deion Sanders, the former football coach at Jackson State University, has recently been encouraging leading black athletes to go to Historically Black Colleges and Universities — schools that have been underfunded due to a long history of oppression. He intends to restore the HBCU-to-NFL pipeline, starting by encouraging the top-ranked football prospect last year to sign with Jackson State, an HBCU, rather than at a school in one of the NCAA’s flagship conferences. This increased Jackson State’s revenue, and many other HBCUs and coaches followed suit in strengthening athletic programs for advancement of these colleges. Activism is inefficient without strategy, and we must apply pressure where we have power. Although it sometimes has adverse consequences, like Colin Kaepernick losing his job after kneeling during the anthem, activism through athletics has proven to be a widely successful endeavor. LeBron James, Serena and Venus Williams, Simone Biles, Colin Kaepernick, Tommie Smith, John Carlos, and many others have had a huge impact on Black activism by dominating their sports, and Black athletes should continue to use that power to advance the cause of Black liberation. When we become dominant, we cannot be silenced, we cannot be ignored, and we cannot be erased. Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts leading this Super Bowl is a win beyond football, and we must continue to make strides for Black people through this medium.

crimson_2023_97,"The course registration period never fails to fill us with a sense of wonder. If you are like me, at the end of each break, your Crimson Cart is filled to the brim with any class that you have any interest in at all, and your August and January days contain hours of perusing Harvard’s manifold course offerings in search of hidden treasures. Fresh from our time spent away from campus, our stores of curiosity replenished from the crushing weight of the last semester, we bask in the endless opportunities before us: to try out a new subject, to broaden our grasp of our field of concentration, or even to fill a credit that brings us closer to the promised land of graduation. All of it fills us with a sense of possibility that pushes us to read dozens of syllabi for classes we will likely never take, to spend hours game-planning our weekly schedules, and to show up to the first one or two lectures of the semester well-rested, with a new notebook and fresh pens, ready to learn. Now, as we return from spring break and begin the concluding half of the semester, does anybody still feel this sense of wonder? We’re two months out of the course registration period, and I would wager that most of our current sentiments toward academic pursuits share very little in common with this beginning-of-semester sense of wonder. We aren’t nearly as excited about school as we used to be. It doesn’t take long for the excited curiosity of the beginning of the term to wear itself out. For some, it might be the first 20-hour problem set that does it. For those more inclined towards the humanities, like myself, it could be the first 3 a.m. night cramming a Frankfurt School reading for Social Studies 10B tutorial — and the week with three essays due that follows it. No matter which way you cut it, our classes lose much of their luster by the time we reach spring break, and the week-long recess does little to restore it. Father Time is not kind to the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed students who walked into the first lecture with a spring in their step. No matter how hard we try to stay excited about our intellectual experiences, it seems that a kind of motivational decay is inevitable. “Burnout” tends to make us cynical and uninterested in the activities we have chosen to fill our days. Part of this unhappy descent seems inescapable: As more assignments and responsibilities pile up, our aspirations lower from the realm of pure intellectual curiosity to that of ensuring our academic self-preservation. Part of it is also a lack of novelty: As we spend more and more time within a class, no matter how engaging, the attraction it had during registration period must wear off. But I am not content to let that be the end of it. After all, wouldn’t we all be more fulfilled with our academic lives if we could sustain the sense of amazement we possessed at the very beginning of the semester? This requires treating our academic pursuits as not only means to a professional end but, at least in part, as ends in themselves. It means holding onto the raw curiosity that fuels our love of learning and prompts us to study what we do. I don’t profess to know the solution. Perhaps professors and teaching fellows designing courses should be more attentive that volume of work often trades off with the desire to do that work. Perhaps the academic calendar could incorporate more frequent breaks or wellness days. But, in the end, the task of staying curious falls to us as students. We all find ourselves faced at times with the specter of hundreds of pages of reading, plus an essay, plus a pset. We should lose the all-or-nothing mindset, common at least to our high school selves, that encourages GPA and resume maximization at the expense of enjoyment. (God knows I am guilty of that mindset . Instead, we should recognize that we get only 32 Harvard classes over four short years and try to take advantage of those classes to the very fullest. We are here not simply because we are capable but because we are curious and eager to learn. As easy as it is to forget our natural curiosity, we would all do well to remember how excited we were at the very beginning of the semester — and try to the best of our ability to find that feeling again. We should take the hiatus of spring break as an opportunity to renew our academic energy. Maybe we can find the magic again. Sam E.

stanforddaily_2023_19,"Five weeks into winter quarter, I learned from a friend that a Taylor Swift course was being offered. ITALIC 99: All Too Well (Ten Week Version , taught by Nona Hungate ’24, is “an in-depth analysis of Taylor Swift’s ‘All Too Well.’” The course recognizes Swift’s brilliant songwriting skills while giving Stanford students the opportunity to learn how to analyze literature. I do not think I have ever felt so sad aboutnotbeing enrolled in a course. The closest I have ever gotten to taking a course about Taylor Swift was my Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR 1 class, “From Green Cards to Gaming Avatars: Forms of Identity,” with lecturer Nissa Cannon. The only aspect of the class that related to Swift was one line in the course description: “Why does Taylor Swift’s album art present a different version of her than a Vanity Fair profile?” Although none of the actual class content was about Swift, I took that singular line and ran with it — my final research-based argument paper was about Swift’s TikTok marketing skills. In researching Swift’s marketing skills, I realized that there is much to learn from Swift aside from her genius songwriting abilities. The public relations and marketing actions performedby Swift and her marketing teamcould produce a fruitful course syllabus that details various tips and tricks for effective advertising. Stanford should consider offering a course that revolves around Taylor Swift’s entrepreneurship in the entertainment industry. Particularly, a course that analyzes Swift’s clever and creative social media marketing skills could benefit many students in various fields, from public relations to economics. For example, in advance of her newest album, “Midnights,” Swift took to TikTok to release a “Midnights Mayhem With Me” series; in each episode, she unveiled the name of a new track. This TikTok series created an immense amount of hype around the album, where fans were unintentionally promoting the album by reposting, commenting, and using “Midnights” sounds. The course could also analyze Swift’s well-known tactic of placing easter eggs to create speculation and conversations about her projects all over social media. When sheconsistently hints at there being secret messagesin her social media posts, music videos, and even red-carpet looks, fans always take to social media to figure out what message Swift is trying to send. Additionally, the course could examine Taylor Swift’s incredible ability to market and sell tangible products in a world of streaming. Despite the rise and prominence of Apple Music, Spotify, and other streaming platforms, Swift is one of the few artists that is still able to sell substantial quantities of CDs, vinyl records and cassette tapes.In fact, tangible music products are where a majority of her “Midnights” sales came from. These sales can be attributed in part to a smart marketing strategy: encouraging fans to buy several copies of the same album. For example, for her “Lover” album, Swift released four physical deluxe versions, with each version containing a different journal with pieces from Swift’s old diaries. In this case, it was nearly impossible for fans to only purchase one deluxe version and miss out on three more journals with content from Swift’s diary. For “Midnights,” Swift took to TikTok to market a (really cool merchandise piece. She announced a “Midnights” clock, made up of four different versions of the album on vinyl. Whenthe back sides of the four different versions are put together, they form a clock that’s actually functional if fans purchase an additional clock set. It is strategies like these, where Swift prompts fans to buy several physical copies of the same album, that translate to sales and thus help Swift retain her relevance. Courses that critically analyze Taylor Swift’s literary skills and cultural influence are already being offered at universities across the country.The University of Texas offered the course “The Taylor Swift Songbook”last year, which focused on “her songs as literary writing and the ways a popular and award-winning writer uses the same literary devices, figures, and tropes of traditional poetry in her work.” The course instructor, English professor Elizabeth Scala, wanted to focus on teaching students about literary analysis through Swift’s clever writing mechanisms, which involve metaphors and the manipulation of words. However, universities are not only studying Swift’s songwriting abilities. In 2022, adjunct instructorBrittany Spanos taught a course at New York University (NYU about Taylor Swiftthat delved into various topics essential to understanding the entertainment industry. It also taught students about Swift’s role in perpetuating the youth and girlhood culture in pop music, social media usage and its impact on the music industry, issues of copyright and ownership, and the prevalence of image and race in contemporary music. A new Stanford course about Taylor Swift could teach new ideas in addition to those taught at the University of Texas or NYU, such as the current impact of TikTok on Swift’s career. The unique Taylor Swift brand crafted by Swift and her marketing team could be fascinating to anyone wanting to work in the entertainment industry or learn more about her enduring cultural influence that never goes out of style.

As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

state_press_2023_42,"The broken turnstiles at Taylor Place on the ASU Downtown Phoenix Campus Sunday, Jan. 29, 2023. Security threats across ASU s four campuses have left students feeling unsafe, both around campus and within their own residence halls. The fact that these events even came close to transpiring shows there are major deficiencies in ASU s housing security that must be addressed in order to keep students safe. In the past week, there have been multiple break-ins in campus residence halls that have put students at immense risk. One example occurred on Saturday at the Downtown Phoenix campus, whena man entered Taylor Placeand stole a student s laptop from her room while she was asleep. Evan Schreyer, a freshman studying sports journalism, encountered the man, identified in court documents as Donald Ray Marshall when he was already on one of the Taylor Place elevators and witnessed him get off on the fourth floor. My first reaction was This guy seems a little old to be a college student, but I didn’t ask questions, Schreyer said. He added there were no communications or altercations with Marshall on the way up. According tothe University s Housing Safety and Security page, front desks are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by Desk Assistants and Desk Managers who are responsible for answering questions and notifying on-duty staff of emergencies and suspicious behavior. The personnel manning the security desk on Saturday clearly failed to adequately perform their duties. On-duty staff was not notified in time by the front desk staff, resulting in students rooms being broken into and one resident s laptop being stolen. Since the incident, little has been done to bolster security measures at Taylor Place. The turnstiles on Taylor Place s ground floor are the only major barrier between non-residents and the residential floors of the dormitory. Other security measures include card scanners at all the building s entrances and by the elevators, but non-residents can easily enter these places when residents scan their cards. For much of the school year, the turnstiles have been non-functional, despite maintenance staff attempting to fix them several times, leaving no physical barrier to non-residents from entering the elevator lobby. Another housing security incident occurred in Tempe s Greek Leadership Village, in which ASU Police Department was alerted that a male suspect was making unwanted advances on female students within the housing complex and attempting to enter the buildings. An image taken of the suspect has tentatively identified him as Robert Stewart Shofner II, who allegedly has an extensive criminal record, including charges of sexual assault and a history of criminal behavior on college campuses. Shofner is reportedly no longer allowed on ASU properties and could face arrest upon return. ASU GLV scommunity plan siteclaims that it has a wide variety of safety features, including multiple electronic card-access points, CCTV and an addressable fire system. If a known criminal like Shofner was able to readily access the community and harass multiple students without arrest, ASU housing security is clearly not putting enough measures in place to protect students. How do we keep letting these security breaches happen? Situations like these lead to a lot of frustration on campus, Schreyer said. This issue is only heightened by the impending mass influx of tourists into the Valley, particularly downtown Phoenix, for Super Bowl LVII, as the majority of signature pre-game festivities will be held indowntown sMargaret T. Hance Park and the Phoenix Convention Center. With the rise in economic activity throughout the Valley, criminal activity rises as well. The ubiquitous sporting event is notorious for being aconvergence point for human trafficking. As the Super Bowl approaches, ASU must greatly improve security measures across all campuses to ensure that no further security breaches occur. A high level of vigilance is key, both during and after the big game comes to the Valley, in order to keep our student populace safe. ASU PD, on one hand, has been effective in disseminating information regarding the suspect in Tempe and arresting Donald Ray Marshall in downtown Phoenix. On the other hand, ASU housing s handling of these security breaches has been absolutely abhorrent. While living at Taylor Place, the only remote change I have witnessed is security advising against using the automatic wheelchair door. Students should not have to be their own security guards. Quite frankly, students should not have to worry about being a victim of a crime within their own on-campus community. Greater measures must be taken immediately to protect students from further break-ins, burglary, sexual harassment and any other crimes that have not yet been perpetrated under the lackadaisical watch of ASU housing security. From hiring more guards to fixing faulty security barriers, the University must do anything and everything to keep its students out of harm s way.

crimson_2023_81,"Be f-cking for real, says the small white girl with beach blonde hair and dressed head to toe in bright pink preppy clothes. “Be f-cking for real,” the newest phrase meaning “be serious,” or in response to something so incredulous it cannot be real. Yes, “be f-cking for real” is correct. But not in the way she probably means it. The phrase, originating from a Black woman, has now been adopted and popularized by white creators in America. There is nothing new about this phenomenon — dominant populations have co-opted minority culture, ideas, and innovation for their own use throughout recorded history — and this theft will, in all likelihood, continue to occur unless something changes. However, this seeming inevitability should not discourage marginalized communities from fighting back, and being vigilant in protecting their intellectual property. Perhaps the word “theft” is too strong. A more accurate term would be “borrowed,” because white creators frequently take ideas and phrases from minority communities, only to discard them and move on to the next trend. “Borrowed,” because once they get tired of playing with our culture, they throw it onto the floor, like a doll that has exhausted its temporary lifetime, and play with their other toys. All the while we, the ones who created the ideas in the first place, lie battered and used on the floor, unwanted and unseen. African-American Vernacular English — the unique grammar, vocabulary, and accents used in Black communities — is not the only aspect of our culture that has been borrowed by white American society. The pattern extends to fashion trends as well. For example, in recent years, the aesthetic of wearing a slick bun with chunky gold hoops, which originated from Latina and Black women, has resurged into mainstream media but has been rebranded as the “clean girl” aesthetic by white women. Another example is the trend of “Brownie glazed lips,” popularized by celebrities such as Hailey Bieber. Where this trend originated, however, goes unacknowledged by Bieber when describing a style that was seen predominantly in Black and Latina cultures throughout the 1990s. This “revamp” of Black and Latina culture, which includes the use of other “borrowed” phrases by white TikTok creators, not only erases the cultural significance of these trends but also perpetuates the marginalization of those communities. We’re told that it’s not inherently harmful to us that these trends are being borrowed. But as Black and brown women around the world have shared tidbits of knowledge from their cultures, the tremendous oversaturation of consumer culture has made it more difficult for the people for whom the products were originally intended to acquire them. For instance, Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Oil, a version of a product used in Black and brown cultures for generations, has found its way into white women’s hearts recently due to a video posted by the famous white TikToker Alix Earle. The problem with this recommendation is not the product itself, but that the over-purchase of this oil, designed mainly for curlier hair, in stores across America has caused the product to go scarce. To be clear, we as Black and brown women are not trying to harm white women, or imply that they do not deserve to thicken their hair, as the oil claims that it can help them do. Instead, the issue is that since hair care companies often appear to prioritize white women, their Black and brown counterparts have less accessibility to hair care products, thus highlighting the disparities between us. Additionally, and worryingly, some Black hair companies have in the past allegedly abandoned formulas created especially for Black hair in favor of reworking their products to appeal to a white audience, strengthening the market dominance of white women. The contagious effects of this market power lead to panic among marginalized groups to stock up on things before formulas change, which exacerbates the problem of product scarcity. The overarching domino effect set off by a single video is what minority creators have been trying to spotlight, to little avail. The perspectives of oppressed populations must be sought out and amplified in order to remedy this problem while addressing white influencers’ liability for their behavior. White influencers should make an effort to learn about the cultural relevance of the trends they are supporting, seek out and work with creators from underrepresented groups, and utilize their influence to advance representation and equity in their fields. It is crucial that society as a whole amplifies the voices of marginalized communities within the fashion and beauty industries, for the purpose of providing fair representation, resources, and opportunities. It isn’t difficult to solicit the perspective of the people whose culture is being appropriated before promoting a product or homogenizing a new phrase. And to those that tell us that that’s too much to ask, I say… Be f-cking for real. Kelisha M. Williams ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Psychology concentrator in Kirkland House.

rice_thresher_2023_61,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/14/23 11:39pm When petitions finished filing in and the candidates for Student Association executive positions were announced, the Thresher Editorial Board was disappointed to learn that out of five executive positions up for election, none were contested. In fact, no one is running for the secretary position, necessitating a special election process. Earlier this semester, we had hopes that the SA election would be taken seriously. Those hopes have been squashed in the face of an underwhelming election. Campus doesn’t seem to be disillusioned with student government even if what little interest the Rice community has in the SA is steadily fading. Several college governments had hotly contested elections this semester. In the case of the recent McMurtry presidential election, three candidates faced off, and just one vote decided the outcome — it’s easy to tell people their vote matters when one vote determines the outcome of an election. It’s harder for our editorial board, one of thestaunchestsupporters of voting in SA elections, to tell campus that voting is worthwhile when all major elections are uncontested. Year after year, SA candidates and the Thresher alike bemoan a lack of external engagement, whether we are responding to low voter turnout or students knowing what the SA does or why, maybe, what they do matters. But, it seems the SA now faces a more daunting challenge: lack of internal engagement. If the SA can’t rally troops within their own ranks to run for positions, how can we expect engagement from the student body? In order for the SA to be taken seriously, there has to be some degree of faith in what they do within the organization itself. Can we claim to be surprised at this turn of events, though? As we near the end of a year-long term, only three resolutions have been passed. Two election directors resigned this year — the third time is hopefully the charm. At this week’s Senate, members of the current executive board simmered with clumsily concealed contempt for each other — can we count how many times presumptive president-elect Solomon Ni said, “I have the floor”? Some weeks ago,oneof the former election directorscriticizedthe Thresher Editorial Board for allegedly undermining the SA. We wish that was the case. Instead, the SA undermines themselves with every action and inaction they take. Let us be clear, we believe the SA has immense potential to leverage their position on campus and connections to campus offices to truly benefit students. That’s why we’re writing this. If we thought the SA was beyond hope, we wouldn’t waste our time with editorials. To the incoming executive board, let us offer our early congratulations and ask you to restore faith in the SA internally by passing resolutions that impact student life, recruiting and retaining committee heads and members, mentoring New Student Representatives and setting our college presidents and senators up for success. It might be a long shot, but with stronger working relationships, maybe new members will stick around and run for positions. And, if they invest time in the SA and the SA invests time in them, there might be meaningful change for campus as a whole that encourages the student body to vote in (hopefully contested SA elections in 2024. On a campus where even Sex Weeks are competing and students are scrambling for resume filler, it seems ridiculous that the SA couldn’t muster up even five candidates willing to put up with a year of serving on their executive board. This isn’t backhanded. We’ll say it to your face: do better. Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

crimson_2023_39,"With Cambridge’s election day approaching, the Cambridge Citizens Coalition hosted an event where people met candidates for the Cambridge City Council in early October. The Boston Democratic Socialists of Americaorganized a protestat the event against the coalition’s endorsed candidates Robert Winters and Carrie E. Pasquarello for liking and reposting transphobic and Islamophobic tweets. CCC steering committee member Marilee Meyer called the protestors’ actions “undemocratic.” “They don’t have to vote for them, but at least do your homework to find out who they are,” she said. While Meyer was well within her rights to criticize the protestors for their message, calling their actions “undemocratic” conveys an incomplete understanding of what democracy entails. Protest and democracy are inextricably linked. Politics does not end at the voting booth — it carries into our conversations with friends and family and our communities. Thus, protestors making their voices heard are not disrupting politics; they are taking part in it. Protest adds to political discourse at large and is critical in informing public debate. It’s true that hearing what candidates have to say, in a forum like this event, is vital in voters’ deliberations. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that what a candidate has to say is not the end of the story. To interpret merely the words spoken from the podium is to miss the bigger picture that contextualizes and gives meaning to spoken words beyond what is immediately apparent. Since we cannot decouple protest and democracy, the question remains: How can we balance protesters’ right to speak with that of invited speakers? In trying to make sense of this issue, it is helpful to examine the question in the similar but closer-to-home environment of college campuses such as our own. TheCouncil on Academic Freedom at Harvardwas formed in March of this year in an effort to advocate for greater free speech and civil discourse on Harvard’s campus. The33-year-old free speech guidelinesfeatured on the council’s website — although written long before recent high-profile student protests againstcontroversial speakers— provide insight into what balancing the interests of speech and protest could look like. In the context of gatherings under FAS, these guidelines prioritize the speaker’s right to be heard, on the rationale that audience members came with the intention of hearing the speaker. They define “disruption” as taking place “over an unreasonable period of time” and preventing the audience from adequately hearing or seeing the speaker. For the most part, these guidelines provide one answer to this urgent question. They aim at preserving the rights of invited speakers, while also acknowledging the importance of including other voices. However, there are many cases where the balance is not so cut and dry. When the group that protests is one that faces frequent marginalization and is rarely, if ever, granted the main platform, it is understandable that they seek to disrupt. Whether they ought to do so is a separate question — but it is important to see that their actions are an understandable response to the context in which they are situated. In my view, the actions of the City Council meet and greet protestors did not appear “disruptive” in any meaningful sense of the word. Their actions were certainly not “undemocratic.” But whenever we have these discussions — in which we consider whether protestors’ actions are undemocratic or contrary to principles of free speech — it is vital to consider the broader context. As civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. said, “a riot is the language of the unheard.” I do not cite this phrase to defend violence, but rather to highlight a keen insight from King: Disruptive protest is a symptom of a larger problem. Protest emerges when people feel unheard and legitimately fear that their voices will continue to be ignored. Before we condemn protests that run contrary to our own values, we must consider whether their disruptive nature comes from a desire to dominate and intimidate, or a desire to be heard and seen. Protest, when conducted in the spirit of illuminating marginalized voices, is not undemocratic; it is a democratic act in response to an insufficient democracy, a democracy that does not hear the voices of all its members. It is a symptom that calls us to listen to the silenced voices that cry out. Allison P. Farrell ’26, a Crimson Editorial comper, lives in Leverett House."
state_press_2023_15,"With other conferences offering better per-member payouts than the Pac-12 could offer with its Apple TV streaming deal, the Big 12 was likely the best fit. However, students and faculty have some concerns regarding the decision. ASU’s move to the Big 12 and college sports conference realignment is a money grab that ignores the needs of athletes and the views of fans. Of course, ASU was put in a difficult spot; as the Pac-12 dissolved around it,it wasn’t exactly feasiblefor the ASU administration to stand pat. With other conferences offering better per-member payouts than the Pac-12 could offer with its Apple TV streaming deal, the Big 12 was likely the best fit. Conferences’ media rights deals ending and being rebuilt are what was at the center of this summer s nationwide realignment, as is usually the case. Yet, the unfortunate necessity of ASU’s move doesn’t dim the reality that athletes are going to bear the brunt of the consequences that are implied. Information provided by ASU Media Relations shows that average air travel time to all Big 12 schools would only increase by 35 minutes as compared to Pac-12 travel without accounting for USC and UCLA. But, that doesn’t account for more travel across time zones and facing opponents on the East Coast. “It’s certainly not like Ohio State driving over to Penn State,” said Zeke Jones, the head ASU wrestling coach. “You got to really take a hard look at it. But will it affect the bank accounts and kids’ sleep? Absolutely.” ASU will have to face opponents in Cincinnati, Orlando and Morgantown, West Virginia, in the upcoming years, whereas former Pac-12 opponents were all located in the American West, and only in two time zones. Those consequences do vary from sport to sport. ASU football will likely have to travel east of the Mississippi River less than other sports because of having fewer conference games in their schedule, but players are still cautious of potential impacts. “It’s gonna be hard, first year, because we’re used to staying on the west coast,” said Will Shaffer, a redshirt junior linebacker at ASU. “But going over that cross country trip, we’re just definitely going to have to adapt and acclimate to that weather change, the time change and we’ve still gotta play a ball game.” Assistant Coach and Running Backs Coach Shaun Aguano said the team will utilize better pre-planning to help deal with the change. “There are gonna be little setbacks and times where we have to go earlier, but I don’t think it’s a huge adversity for the team,” Aguano said. Across the board, athletes are going to travel more and deal with greater struggles including sleep schedules, academics and handling personal life. College athletes and former college athleteshave spoken outabout the stress they deal with andmany studies have been conductedshowing the dual stressors of academics and athletic performance. “When you’re traveling across four time zones… that puts your body in disarray, and you’re expected to maintain a high level of performance, both athletically and academically,” Victoria Jackson, clinical assistant professor of history and a former ASU track and field athlete said. These changes, according to Jackson, are not distributed evenly across sports. She said women’s basketball will “have to deal with the repercussions of these football money decisions,” and that it “seems to always be the neglected sport.” Another possible consequence, one denied by Vice President for University Athletics and Athletic Director Ray Anderson, is the potential need to cut sports. “I don’t see how you’re still not at the end of the day, we’re going to have to start cutting sports because the cost of travel and support, it’s going to increase so much,” Jackson said. “None of this is sustainable. It’s really financially irresponsible, even though they claim it’s the way to stay solvent.” Keri Matthews, a junior forward for ASU women’s soccer, said the team will be ready for the change, but that it will be sad to leave the conference. “Obviously, (the Pac-12 is one of the best conferences to play in and so it’s sad that it’s going,” Matthews said. As if the physical and mental impacts on athletes and the potential financial fallout from conference realignment aren t enough, the lost traditions and fan disappointment are palpable. Some ASU students voiced disappointment with the move, and others hoped for greater compensation for ASU athletes. “I think it’s fair if the athletes are compensated fairly. So, for example, if they’re given rest days between travel time, if their professors are willing to work with them around the travel schedule for football… I think it’s only fair if they are compensated according to the extent of their travel,” said Duncan Kincaid, a junior at ASU studying finance. Pranjal Krishna, a sophomore studying computer science, said he understood that ASU had to leave the Pac-12, but that he’ll really miss matches with Stanford, USC, and teams like that.” The era of the Pac-12 was far from perfect. Athletes still dealt with stressors, low compensation and academic complications with travel. However, the logic of the conference from the standpoint of the athletes and institutions was undeniable geographically. Traditions that those involved enjoyed were abound, some of which will certainly stay, like the cross-state rivalry with UA. But, others will likely be lost. Regular exciting matchups with regional teams, like UCLA, USC and Stanford in many sports will be missed. This doesn’t mean universities cannot ensure academic and athletic success for their athletes. ASU will certainly put measures in place to help its athletes, but compensation is still a valid concern for some, and other athletes have spoken out in the past aboutperceived unequal treatment. Athletes and their fans should advocate for adequate support throughout conference realignment and also push for a better, more logical process that makes conferences put student-athletes first, not media rights deals.

crimson_2023_38,"As you sift through concentration requirements, plow through the Q Guide, and search my.harvard for ‘gems’ duringearly registrationfor spring courses, be careful. That class you’ve just added to your Crimson Cart might be taught by someone facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. At a university that seems to consistently prioritize profit and prestige over the safety of its students, a ‘nightmare prof’ can sometimes mean something much worse than harsh grading. This spring, Harvard is allowing two professors who were found to have violated the University’s sexual harassment policies to teach students. Anthropology and African and African-American Studies professor John L. Comaroffwas placed on unpaid administrative leavein 2022 after internal reviews of multiple sexual harassment and professional retaliation allegations. Alawsuit filed against Harvardby three Anthropology graduate students detailed accounts of unwanted kissing, groping, and sexual remarks, in addition to retaliation, by Comaroff during his time at Harvard and the University of Chicago. Still, the professor has denied any wrongdoing. But a federal judgefound evidencethat Harvard “engaged in a long-term pattern and practice of indifference to complaints of sexual harassment” against Comaroff and two other senior Anthropology professors. Masses of students, including the three of us, staged awalkout, arally, and anoccupation of University Halllast spring to protest his continued employment. Yet Comaroff remains on the faculty. Hopi E. Hoekstra, the new dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,recently confirmedthat, to her knowledge, Comaroff is still sanctioned, specifying that he is not allowed to teach required courses. This restriction is the absolute bare minimum. He’s still teaching two African and African American Studies courses this spring. Both require students to personally email him why they would like to take his class — granting Comaroff full discretion over who can be his student. Both courses are also fully remote. After the walkout during the most recent class he taught this spring, it looks as if he may be avoiding the accountability of showing his face on campus. In the Economics department, professor Roland G. Fryer Jr. is also teaching next semester. In 2018, Fryer was thesubject of at least four Harvard investigations; another at the state level was eventually withdrawn. In 2019, Fryer was placed on atwo-year administrative leaveafter an investigation found he had verbally harassed women and fostered a hostile work environment in his former lab, in violation of the University’s sexual harassment policies. When Fryer returned to teaching in 2021, he wrote an apology letter that was shared with the Economics department. Fryer was then prevented from holding advisory or supervisory positions for another two years. But at this point in time, it’s unclear whether those sanctions are still in place. Fryer’s name may seem especially familiar to many upperclassmen, for he has previously served as a guest lecturer for the weekly special lecture series in one of the largest courses at Harvard, Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” — sessions that students must attend in-person or rewatch recordings of online. Meanwhile in the Mathematics and Biology departments, professor Martin A. Nowak was formerly the head of a program that received significant donations from convicted sex offenderJeffrey E. Epsteinand granted Epstein unrestrained access to the facility on Harvard’s campus. Nowak was put onpaid administrative leavein 2020. In 2021, he wasbarred fromserving as Principal Investigator on grants or taking on new advisees, but he remained able to teach undergraduate courses. These remaining sanctions werefully liftedin March of this year — allowing Nowak to quietly teach a Mathematics course this semester. And these are three cases of professors publicly found guilty and sanctioned — by a university whichhas been suedfor its Title IX failures. If Comaroff was still hired at Harvard despite decades of alleged sexual misconduct at the University of Chicago, and Government professorJorge I. Domínguez, now retired, was allegedly able to sexually harass and assault at least 18 women over the span of nearly 40 years without retribution, it’s easy to imagine that many other abuses may have slipped through the cracks — or been willfully ignored. Harvard’s functionalrefusal to firetenured professors who’ve been found to have violated sexual harassment policies forces students to choose between their education and their safety. We’re supposed to freely pursue academic exploration, take advantage of a transformative experience, and avoid 9 a.m. classes on Fridays — not spend our time Googling whether or not our potential instructor has charges of sexual violence against them. It’s a shame that the University seems to believe otherwise. The Harvard administration’s pattern of punishing professors who have violated sexual harassment policies by putting them on temporary leave, and then quietly allowing them to come back relatively unscathed, further endangers younger students who may be unaware of their professors’ checkered histories. Harvard’s currentofficial procedurefor formal complaints of alleged harassment showcase a similarly alarming leniency toward faculty. While the discipline proceedings for a Title IX complaint against a student detail an involved Administrative Board procedure and examples of disciplinary actions, the corresponding procedure for a complaint against a faculty member is less defined, designating the responsibility of discipline solely to the FAS dean or their designee. This utter lack of transparency exacerbates the problem. As the administration continues to quietly allow professors found guilty of sexual misconduct to return to teaching, we, the students, must protect each other — because Harvard has failed to.

state_press_2023_14,"An ASU Community of Care kit mask sits on top of Devil s Drop Off saliva testing kits, on Monday, Jan. 24, 2021, in Tempe. Although the University s lack of communication about COVID-19 at the beginning of this semester makes it seem like a concern of the past, ASU should still actively inform students about its health risks. COVID cases are on the rise. The Arizona Department of Health Services reported3,381 new caseson Aug. 20 from the preceding week, with new infections per week more than doubling since July 2. Remnants of the virus clearly run rampant. However, the University communicates sparsely about it. ASU has yet to return to weekly COVID campus reports since the start of the fall semester. The University slateststatement dates back to July 17, 2023. The website also fails to provide campus-specific COVID numbers. According to Natalia Stifano, program coordinator at Barrett, The Honors College, the University only sent one email at the start of the semester about COVID guidelines to staff members. At least in the communication that the staff receives from ASU… we don’t get it very often, it’s usually like at the start of every semester, where we just kind of get reminded of the CDC recommendations… at this time, that seems to be what ASU chooses to follow, Stifano said. Yet, with the amount of emails staff and students receive per week, this communication can easily go unread. The COVID-19 notice is also not reflected in the University’s social media accounts and classroom buildings, severely limiting its potential reach. This year, posters promoting COVID awareness noticeably decreased around campus. This lack of communication implies to students that the University is ready to move on from the pandemic. Replacing ASU s previously widespread COVID testing reminders with a measly email sent to already overflowing inboxes won t help students prioritize their health and their community s wellbeing. In terms of programming, there is no ASU COVID policy in place, Stifano said. With ASU returning to pre-pandemic protocols, the threat of the virus has seemingly faded into the background. “ASU dropping the whole COVID safety precautions safety out of nowhere reinforces the idea that many corporations and/or universities… (are saving face in public until they don’t need to anymore,” said Stylé Ranger, a graduate student at the Thunderbird School of Management majoring in global management. In contrast to ASU s somewhat timid approach to navigating COVID this school year, other universities have made it more explicit. For instance, Harvard College kept its “isolate-in-place policy” where students exposed to the virus quarantine in specially assigned suites. In addition, Harvard encourages students to havea conversationwith roommates in order to plan for what to do in case of potential infections. ASU’s notice, however, only meekly suggests that students follow self-isolation per CDC recommended steps rather than having a clearly stated requirement. Additionally, ASU does not actively promote its COVID resources on social media or its website, despite the fact that ASU provides free COVID testing throughDevil’s Drop-OffandCOVID vaccine shots and boostersfor both its staff and students. Dr. Rizwana Biviji, a professor specializing in reducing healthcare disparities at the College of Health Solutions, suggested ways for the University to help students prioritize COVID resistance. Biviji said the University could be “promoting (the resources even more, encouraging students that these are the resources, get tested often, maybe assigning some incentives too. Promoting that ... a little bit more so that students are aware. ASU s lack of action could directly harm students, particularly those who are immunocompromised. When exposed to COVID, Emma Horton, a sophomore studying global studies, can experience intensifiedCrohn s diseasesymptoms. Lack of awareness increases her infection risk. (COVID also causes a Crohn’s flare-up,” Horton said. “My body’s already fighting so hard that when you introduce another virus it doesn’t fare very well for myself.” Just because cases are going down doesn’t mean that the virus is completely gone. In fact, a new variant has already been reported and could be a threat if ASU doesn t help safeguard its students, particularly immunocompromised ones, highlighting the need for properly promoted health awareness. While COVID is still around, ASU s protocols should be, too. Edited by Mia Osmonbekov, Sadie Buggle and Angelina Steel Reach the columnist atyonayan@asu.eduand follow@youla_onayanon X.

rice_thresher_2023_60,"BySehoon Baek2/21/23 10:15pm If last Monday’s shooting at Michigan State University shows us anything, it is that our grounds for learning are not immune from the uniquely American plague of gun violence. Of course, when I say this, I recognize that it isn’t anything new – the three Spartans senselessly slaughtered on Feb. 13 join the long ranks of those killed at Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas and Robb Elementary. Neither is the fact that our own community faces even a slight possibility of the likes of Michigan State; last November, shots were fired near the BRC, while two Wednesdays ago, on February 8, a car drove recklessly through the Academic Quad. These breaches in security, combined with a recent spate of mass shootings across the country, show that our community needs to be prepared for any eventuality – the first of three ways we can begin to understand and react to a tragedy like in East Lansing. While many of our students and staff are aware of how to respond to an active shooter situation, the unique characteristics of such a situation are such that it can occur at any time and any place. Should it arise, students and instructors need to know how to react quickly and effectively in their present setting with the objects and doors around them, especially given our significant international population who may not have experienced active shooter training as is practiced in the United States. Even setting aside five minutes on a single weekday for professors and college cabinets to go over emergency procedures with their students would likely enhance the immediate response that community members can provide in a dangerous situation. Our second and most important task is to make something of thelifeof which Brian, Arielle and Alexandria were so unjustly deprived. All of us here at Rice enjoy a privilege that many would clamor to possess yet cannot have. We have access to abundant resources to help us every day, whether they be Rice Health Advisors, consultants for the Center for Academic and Professional Communication or Teachers’ Assistants. We have friends, RAs, family members, professors and magisters who cherish us. We have our own hearts and brains, each equipped with a unique set of skills and knowledge that brought us all here to the Hedges in various roles. In every one of us lies the ability tocreatewith what we are given and what we learn; to mold what lies around us into that which we desire. That is our charge, ourdebtto these three, and every single person struck down by bullets on campus grounds: to be the men and women they can never be. We owe it to every victim killed through no fault of their own that we accomplish something in the time that we are given but they can no longer claim – including making sure that this epidemic of artificial death stops as soon as possible. This is our third and final task: using the abilities each of us have to transform our frustration, our acquiescence into action. Our campus, our city and our state at large are host to a wide variety of diverging beliefs, meaning that there will always be disagreements on the exact nature and scope of that action. But it cannot hurt just totry– to enact, even for a little while, possible solutions to this long-standing problem that an overwhelming majority of Americans support. In complacence and pessimism lie the enablers of death and bane, both of which cannot persist any longer. And we cannot remain complacent any longer – not when our grounds for Letters could tomorrow, become our grounds of Slaughter. We cannot be indifferent any longer – not when our halls for Art can too, serve as desolate halls of Grief; not when our laboratories for Science could become laboratories of Sorrow. We must put our pens and brushes to canvas, our voices to megaphones, our signatures to petitions to demand that something,anythingcan be done. The younger lives untimely taken in Sandy Hook and Uvalde demand action – for the sake of our own lives,wetoo must demand it. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2023_80,"To be a descendant of slavery is to be an “other” within the Black community at Harvard. The time is now to dig beyond the surface of a diverse community and interrogate all facets of Black representation: Who is being left behind and how can Harvard reimagine what diversity looks like as it remembers the mark that slavery has left on its descendants? According to Harvard professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr., between one-half and two-thirds of Black students at Harvard in 2004 were either West Indian and African immigrants or their children, or children of biracial couples. This would mean that descendants of slavery in America — those known as Generational African Americans — are starkly underrepresented. The term “Generational African American” was coined by Reverend Isaiah Webb, grandfather of Samantha C. W. O’Sullivan ’22. O’Sullivan was the founder of theGenerational African American Students Associationat Harvard. In 2015,U.S.-born Black householdshad a median income and educational attainment level that was about 30 percent and 7 percent lower, respectively, than that of Black immigrant households. This likely causes more Generational African Americans to sit at the intersection of low socioeconomic status and being first-generation college students — a combination that has both proven to serve as a barrier to college admission and has strong ties to slavery. The Generational African American identity is one that has endured more pain and perseverance than one can imagine — pain and perseverance that has not ceased to penetrate our lives today. The socioeconomic effects of slavery and oppression under Jim Crow are alive and well and continue to exist as a boundary to higher education for those who are descended from those who experienced its restrictions. Harvard is an institution that, givenits ties to slavery, has a reparative responsibility to Generational African Americans. Previous instances of this conversation have incited conflict amongst Black groups across the diaspora. College admissions is not a zero-sum game and the purpose of this discussion is to point out a disparity, not to disunify the Black community. Rather than this raising a question of whether Black immigrants are deserving of their hard-earned seats at these elite institutions (which is not even up for discussion , I wish to call on Harvard to recognize their failure at ensuring the representation of Generational African American descendants of slavery. It is integral that college admissions committees stop treating Blackness as a monolith. Harvard is hiding behind the checkbox of “Black/African American.” Rather than taking time to truly appreciate the unique perspective that each and every Black person brings with them, and allowing space for more nuanced identification, this checkbox collapses the multifaceted Black experience into one category. In the wake of the lawsuit between theStudents for Fair Admissions v. Harvard College, universities across the country are looking to Harvard to stand for diversity. Even if affirmative action is deemed unconstitutional, institutions like Harvard are responsible for ensuring that diversity is maintained. Harvard should set a precedent — one that takes accountability for its part in thelegacy of slaverynot solely through a public report, but through the recognition of the deficit of descendants on this campus. So where do we go from here? As a Generational African American at Harvard myself, I wish I had the statistics to describe the feeling of otherness that stems from being a minority within a minority. Therefore, the first step to improving representation among Generational African American students is to offer a more specific breakdown of Black identities. Then, the schools can quantify the disparity and potentially understand the drivers and its connection to the legacy of slavery. Whether Harvard is aware of the issue and simply chooses to ignore it, or if they do not notice it at all, it is their responsibility to fix it. Either way, to be a school so publicly claiming responsibility for its part in perpetuating the egregious legacy of slavery, Harvard must grapple with the fact that it so often closes its doors to those same students whose ancestors built it.

state_press_2023_43,"Increasing layoffs within the tech industry are creating stress in both ASU students looking to go into the field and tech companies looking to hire. Google, Meta and Microsoft recentlylaid off tens of thousands of workers, unnerving career seeking students and demonstrating tech s jaw-dropping apathy toward its labor force. Promises of job security drew ASU students like Anthony Delphy, a senior studying computer science, to the tech field. However, mass layoffs jaded his previously rosy perspective. The layoffs called into question my choice of major, because there were multiple majors that could ve indulged me, he said. I was originally looking into an animation major, but I felt that computer science was a safer bet. But now it honestly feels like they re about the same in terms of security. As a graduating student, Delphy worries about increased competition for the shrinking tech job pool, a byproduct of so many layoffs. Now there are tens of thousands of other programmers with years of experience ahead of me who ve worked at places like Google or Meta or Microsoft, he said, and I m supposed to be entering this workforce and compete? Andreas Kostøl, an applied economist at the W.P. Carey School of Business, agrees that the post-layoff job market hurts new graduates the most. You lose the competition against experienced people because they have these companies on their CV, even if they were laid off, he said. A couple years in Google makes a difference compared to someone who is coming straight out of college. As for what drove these tech layoffs, the answer boils down to companies choosing shareholder profits over people, despite the latter being the source of innovation. The investors look at this talent and they think that all these clever people will come up with amazing ideas and you hire them, Kostøl said. Up until the point where investors say no, now you need to trim and improve your margins and then you let them go. This idea of workers being disposable for big tech companies steered Delphy s preference toward smaller startups. It definitely pushes me toward smaller, lesser-known companies, ones that I feel are more close-knit, he said, adding that even having a smaller salary is worth not feeling like I’m going to be fired at a random moment. This fear of being fired at a random moment will likely turn college talent away from big tech companies, since students like Delphyprefer minimizing risk. People are going to look elsewhere and are going to be reluctant about taking these jobs, Kostøl said. I m sure it s going to be harder for Google and these companies to hire in the short run. With their sudden mass layoffs, Google, Meta and Microsoft seem to have forgotten the COVID-19 pandemic s lessons about undervaluing employees. From desperatelyraising wagesto keep workers loyal duringthe great resignationto cutting them off overnight, tech companies brazenly reveal their true colors: a glaring apathy toward the people that make them great. Ironically enough, by equating short-term profits with success, tech companies completely miss that hiring and retaining talent, not eating away at it, actually determines theirlongevity. In the end, this kind of apathy only ends up killing potential long-term profit from ideas generated by a smart, sustainable and sizable workforce. Right now, students may fear how mass layoffs upended the tech job market. But down the road, mass layoffs may actually end up haunting the companies themselves.

stanforddaily_2023_18,"This series from the community features members of the SAPAAC(Stanford Asian Pacific American Alumni Club Asian American Studies Coalitionfrom different generations sharing their first-hand experiences as Asian Americans on campus. Visitwww.sapaac.orgto find out more about the coalition’s efforts to advocate for Asian American Studies at Stanford. Read previous entries:Fall 2021,Winter 2022,Spring 2022andSummer 2022. During the fall of 1973, as a freshman living in Arroyo House in Wilbur Hall, I received a form seeking input about activities that might interest me. The survey ended with a request to “rate my Asian consciousness.” This attempt to gauge new students’ interest in Asian American-themed activities was completely lost on me, because I was not yet in tune with my ethnic and cultural identity. Growing up in New Jersey, my childhood friends were descendants of Ellis Island immigrants who came from Europe. I was familiar with the challenges their grannies and papaws had overcome to learn English, establish skills and provide for their families. However, I had no appreciation forthe experienceof tens of thousands of Japanese Americans who had beenforced to leave their homes, friends,land, businessesand belongings inearly 1942. I only vaguely recalled stories from my own cousins about living in horse stalls at theSanta Anita Racetrackor celebrating a new baby sister in barracks amid sagebrush and cactus. Unfortunately, Stanford University in the 1970s did not provide much academic education in these matters. Beyond an occasional “study breakbao” at the student-run People’s Teahouse in Junipero — laterrenamed Okada House in 1979— I remained only vaguely aware of our community’s footprint. While I was at Stanford, Asian Americans representedjust 4.9 percentof the undergraduate student body. Only later did I come to appreciate theenormity of the injusticetoward Japanese Americans, through researching my own dad’s story. He sought to avoidincarcerationwith roughly 5,000 other “voluntary evacuees,” escaping from Pasadena to Utah in early 1942, only to be arrested twice and held at theAlien Detention Centerin Missoula, Montana. He was eventually paroled and allowed to return to his life and profession as a photographer. More broadly, thecircumstances Japanese Americans facedwere absurd, and thefrustrationthey endured ininternment campsand alien detention centers was unimaginable. I cannot fathom leaving my home and job withonly a couple of suitcases, and thenreturning years laterto start over — or even journeying somewhere entirely new to create a life for my family. In uncovering the Japanese American story, I encountered two individuals with deep Stanford ties who reinforced institutional racism through actions that seem crazy and loathsome today. Several of our institution’s early thought leaders, including Stanford presidentsDavid Starr JordanandRay Lyman Wilbur, promulgated the tenets of eugenics. So didDr. Edward Alsworth Ross, a professor of economics and sociology from 1893-1900. Fanning a fear thatAsian immigrationwould ruin the “Anglo-Saxon character of American society,” Ross reportedly suggested that “should the worst come to the worst, it would be better for us to train our guns on every vessel bringing Japanese to our shores than permit them to land.” He waseventually fired, in part for his advocacy of eugenics. A proud Stanford alumnus,Colonel Karl R. Bendetsen’29 L.L.B. ’32 — who, interestingly, denied his Jewish faith to join the Theta Delts, andchanged the spellingof his last name from “Bendetson” in 1942 in an attempt to appear Danish — also spearheaded virulent anti-Asian efforts. He is described as the chief architectbehindPresident Franklin Roosevelt’sExecutive Order 9066, which authorized the exclusion of 120,000 Japanese Americans from the West Coast. The sweeping action ordered any person, no matter their age, who had “one drop of Japanese blood” to be confined. All this was unknown to me when I was on campus in the 1970s: there were no Asian American Studies courses. I wish I had been invited to class discussions about America slamming the door onimmigrants from Chinaand preventingJapanese from becoming naturalized citizens. I wish I had been able to learn about Colonel Bendetsen’srolein the mass incarceration of an entire generation living on our West Coast. Instead, I waltzed through much of my life without appreciating these stunning injustices. In 2023, Asian Americans make upmore than one-quarterof undergraduates and19.6% of our overall student body. Our community recognizes the complex history of the Asian American experience, even without being prompted by a student survey. But does Stanford believe the same? Students deserve to learn about the unjust, exclusionist and politically motivated actions — including those initiated by Stanford alumni and faculty — that have impacted Asian American lives and our collective culture. It has been slow going since thefounding of the Asian American-theme dormin 1971, more than 50 years ago — and over25 years since the establishmentof an Asian American Studies program at Stanford. The program was habitually underfunded and neglected, and there were years when the most basic “Introduction to Asian American Studies” course wasnot even offered. Let’s not force students togo elsewhere for Asian American Studieswhen Stanfordhas the potential to createthese learning experiences. This school year, we now have a newAssociate Directorof Asian American Studies. And due in large part to the enthusiasm and generosity of the Stanford Asian American Studies Endowment Initiative (SAASEI , we finally see the University administration, the Office of Development and the School of Humanities and Science collaborating to support a new Asian American research center. This is an amazing start, with the potential to become a robust education and research program — and hopefully a sign that the University now considers Asian American Studies an academic priority. There is much more to be done — and we will be watching closely to see that the University follows through on these efforts and more. May the Class of 2026 and all future students be able to choose from a wide array of Asian American Studies classes, reflecting our community’s diversity!

rice_thresher_2023_37,"ByBen Baker-Katz4/18/23 10:09pm For the last two years, whenever someone has tried to make plans with me on a Tuesday, I’ve responded with some version of “I can’t, I’ve got Thresher.” The natural next question, after I explain that putting together a weekly paper takes up the vast majority of every Tuesday, is “Why do you spend so much time on it?” And silly as it may seem, I’ve never really come up with a good answer to that question. I usually give some obligatory answer along the lines of “I enjoy it, and I think the work we produce makes campus a better place.” Both of those things are true, but they don’t accurately convey the extent of my answer. It wasn’t until recently, when I began to seriously reflect on leaving this job, that I realized the true purpose of the Thresher is what it leaves behind. Do yourself a favor, and spend some time exploring the Thresherarchives. Pick a random issue, or choose one very deliberately, and immerse yourself in whatever was happening on campus that week. From old intramural sports coverage, to discussion of conscription’s impact on students to the phenomenal shenanigans that Rice students used to get up to, I promise it is well worth your time. I’m incredibly proud of the work the Thresher has published in my two years in leadership. Some articles made me laugh, others made me cry, but they were all worth writing. I hope that, in a few decades, someone will be looking back at our archives to learn about what Rice was like in the years following the pandemic, and thoroughly enjoying themselves in the process. Now it’s time for some obligatory sappiness. Thank you to Savannah Kuchar and Ivanka Perez for being the best EIC role models imaginable. Thank you to Katharine Shilcutt, for agreeing to a job with no idea what she was getting herself into and for helping me love Houston. Thank you to Morgan Gage, the most talented person I’ve ever worked with. And finally, thank you to Kelley Lash — gone but never forgotten, you are missed every day on the second floor of the RMC. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month.

crimson_2023_79,"I visited Lahore for the first time in a year this winter break. I was greeted by the familiar embrace of my parents at the airport. As we stepped out of the terminal, bags in hand, I caught a glimpse of another acquaintance of mine who studied in the U.S. making his way towards a car. We were probably on the same flight. Each winter break, as several Pakistani students make their way back to the country for a few weeks, it is often the case that one runs into peers traveling at the same time as oneself. Our homecoming begins somewhere between Istanbul, Abu Dhabi, and Doha, where we often share layovers and flight delays — thanks to Lahore’s treacherous smog — together. Yet, these fragments of familiarity that characterize many of our return journeys soon begin to dissipate. Every time I come back to Lahore, it feels different. It doesn’t matter how frequently I call home, or how up-to-date I am with my friends’ lives despite the 10-hour time difference. There’s a stark difference between glitchy WhatsApp calls detailing my grandmother’s illness or the more than three dozen texts that detail my friend’s inability to cope with an impending breakup, versus experiencing these events as they happen: confronting them face-to-face, without the usual hint of retrospective clarity and consolation that often dominates many of my calls home. When you layover in a city for just three weeks, you often feel like a stranger on premises that you used to call your own. This is the home that you long to go back to, only to find out that you remembered a version of it that no longer exists. Thus, when I saw how my mother appeared more visibly exhausted than when I had seen her last winter, neglecting her own health to tend to my ailing grandmother, I could do nothing but listen to her reassurances about her well-being. I couldn’t be there for her longer than three weeks – at best, I could urge her to schedule an appointment with the doctor while I was still in Lahore. My father’s 12-hour work days became a similar source of concern. Here I was, witnessing him confine himself to his ‘home office,’ with only meals serving as real breaks from his new job. I wanted him to spend those hours writing – what he loved doing best – but his work had rendered him incapable of finding the time to do so. As I begin to end my time at Harvard, and increasingly ponder about how I can support my family once I graduate, I am confronted with a series of intimidating questions every time I apply for internships, research grants, and get on a networking call. How much do I want to earn? How much is enough? Where will I be located? Where will I be located? I don’t know. Because on the one hand, I’ve always wanted to work in Pakistan – everything I care about, and have tailored my education towards, is based there. Yet employment in the United States would likely be more lucrative than most opportunities back in Lahore. This was the only advice I got during my three weeks at home, too: People that had initially encouraged me to return upon completing my degree now grimly described the recent economic devastation, urging me to stay put in the US. There is a looming sense of escape: “Everyone wants to leave, and is leaving here. You have the option to stay in the U.S. Don’t waste it.” I didn’t know how to explain to them, as they meandered between conversations over cigarettes and cups of tea, that I didn’t want to further my sense of foreignness at home. My friends, also fellow returnees from wherever they were in the world, felt similarly about navigating the perceived constancy of home, and the newness that they now had to confront. Collectively, we are a handful of students that have been given a wild-card, in the form of prestigious scholarships or financial aid awards, to make a life for ourselves beyond Pakistan. Yet as we grow closer to actually being able to do so, the costs of being away from family and the familiarity of home suddenly become apparent, pervading one’s every decision. At Harvard, we are constantly prompted to make the most of our time here: chase every opportunity, travel, meet as many people as possible, engage with a neverending list of communities. As we endeavor to exhaust the possibilities that our four years in college present, we recraft our definitions of home and find our chosen families. Yet we often lose sight of the implicit tradeoffs we make with the worlds we leave behind. As I packed my bags at the end of my third week in Lahore, this time to embark on a journey to the U.K. for a study abroad program, I only wished that I had more time at home. I didn’t care if the conversations were inconclusive, frustrating, or left me with more questions than answers. I just wished that time at home stopped feeling like limbo — empty time extended between semesters, and between my supposed pursuits to craft a life abroad. Asmer A.

crimson_2023_96,"Bicycles are nimble, quick, green, and affordable. They’re even better when they fold up. Last September, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 announced plans to add 9.4 miles of new bike lanes to the existing 84 miles of marked routes in the city. She wants 50 percent of Bostonians to be within a three-minute walk from a safe, connected bike route within three years. Let me take Mayor Wu’s bid and raise it. Not only does Boston need more cycle lanes; the future of American cities should belong to the folding pushbike. Here’s why. I recently moved to Boston from London. My fold-up bicycle let me connect London’s cycle lanes and public transport so I could do far more with my time. I made house calls to patients, carried my bike on buses and trains, tucked it beside me in the pub, and walked it upstairs to my flat at night. One of the biggest folding bicycle brands in Britain is Brompton. Since a pre-production run of 60 were sold in 1982, the Brompton’s small wheels and simple geometry have become a feature of London transport as distinctive as the black cab and the red bus. The reason is clear: Folding bicycles make London more livable. My own bike is a Brompton with three gears and mudguards. In the mornings, I rode it through Victoria Park and up the towpath on the River Lea when my visits took me to Walthamstow or Chingford. I’ve cycled through the Alps, Dolomites, and Atlas mountains, and crossed Milan during rush hour on an old touring bike, and I feel comfortable squeezing past buses on Oxford Street. The objective is that of a cat’s whiskers or a goalkeeper: to determine what will fit a given space. My confidence comes in part from the dense mass of riders who have fanned across central London in recent years: approximately 161,000 per day. Drivers have reason to check their mirrors and pull out carefully: There’s almost always a cyclist. The more who cycle, the safer it gets. London currently has a Congestion Charge: a £15 daily fee for driving a car in the Congestion Charge zone, which has gradually ratcheted up the cost of driving in London. The legitimacy of this measure rests on the availability of viable public transport alternatives. Fortunately, London also has at least 9,300 buses on 675 routes and 272 stations connecting 402 kilometers of London Underground track. Rail strikes notwithstanding, the way London allows its over 9.6 million residents to get around without need of a car is central to its status as a great city. Many American cities were designed for cars, but as Robert A. Caro demonstrates in “The Power Broker,” his vast biography of dominant New York urban planner Robert Moses, no number of additional roads and bridges have sustainably allayed New York City’s infamous congestion. Millions of Americans stew needlessly for hours in their car each day. Public transport can be an efficient, sustainable future for America. Folding bicycles can complete the link from station to front door. Admittedly, my folding bike, priced from $1,150, cost four times more than my first car (a Ford Fiesta bought from beneath the tree of a local farmer, its chassis long since defunct, God rest it and is only a sensible mode of transport because the city I usually work in has decent bus and rail infrastructure. Hiring a Bluebike is an affordable alternative for Bostonians, although these bikes aren’t allowed on buses, trains, or ferries. Those who know the mirthless comedy of traffic around Harvard Square will surely agree that life in Cambridge, Boston, New York, and across the United States would be better if more Americans cycled and fewer drove while leaning furiously on their horns. We are past the point where we can escape or ignore the effects of climate change — your Harvard credentials will not save you from our shared life and fate. To mitigate the worst effects of the changing earth, the citizens of high-income, high-emitting countries must rapidly change the way we live. It can begin with how you get to the grocery store. I realize that asking U.S. cities to break their motorcar addiction and deliver public transport services people actually want to use may seem as quixotic as locking your arms and back into a stickman posture to force a three-gear folding bike up a mountain. But it can be done. To stand a chance of leaving this world fit to live in for generations to come, we need to change what we invest in, where we go, and how we get there. Is that not the road to the future? Let’s get there by bicycle. Dr. Adam Boggon is a Fulbright scholar at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health."
stanforddaily_2023_103,"At eight years old I landed in Santa Rosa, CA — enthralled by crosswalks with buttons, school buses and the concept of sleepovers — things that normally lived in the TV. I realized quickly that my nose and hairy arms didn’t really fit into this TV world, and I was equally the subject of enthrallment — or curiosity perhaps. I don’t remember the first time I was asked this question, but by the time I was in high school I had perfected the repertoire that followed “Where are you from?” “Armenia.” “Oh, Romania?” “No, Armenia.” “What is that?” “You know Turkey?” “Yeah, I love Turkey!” “Just one country to the right.” This was usually followed by my synopsis of theArmenian Genocide of 1915and the systematic murder, rape and ethnic cleansing of over 2 million Armenians by Turkey during the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, which remains unrecognized until today. April 24th marks the remembrance day of the Genocide. These days it’s also followed by futile attempts at explaining the history of Artsakh, thewar of 2020, and the incessant fighting that has resulted in the ethnic cleansing of historical Armenian lands, executed by Azerbaijan with the support of Turkey. Like you reading this right now, I’m usually out of breath by the end of my spiel. After enough iterations of this conversation, it became a normal routine to begin my introduction by explaining my history and myself. After enough instances of being met with unawareness and incomprehension, you start to understand that your reality is not shared by others. It exists in your mind, in a series of memories and fables of lands out of reach told in a language that no one speaks. After enough summers of seeing your hometown streets empty and your people drained of their faith, you begin to understand that their weight has been shifted to your shoulders. It is up to you to keep singing, keep speaking հայերեն, and keep telling stories. I came to learn of the stories of America. I know the histories, struggles, resistances, genocides, diasporas, symbols … I listen to the music. I touch and feel this shared reality that defines my life outside of the Armenian island that is our apartment and its 25-square-foot garden in Santa Rosa. Going to Armenia is entering a different dimension. While I was visiting my hometown last summer, the conflict rekindled between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I saw an entire nation hold its breath, I saw my uncle prepare to leave for war, and I saw children and mothers learn how to transport wounded soldiers. I spent a week painting a brand new mural with schoolchildren in an Armenian village called Աղավնո (meaning Dove that two weeks later was emptied and handed off to Azerbaijani troops. The villagers decided to destroy the crosses and erase the Armenian language from the mural because they didn’t want Azeris to do it. On Instagram, I saw a Stanford summer — full of its own microcosms of experience defined by the bubble of Stanford and the cradle of Silicon Valley. A few months later, in the dead of winter, 120,000 people wereblockadedinto the Artsakh enclave by the Azerbaijani military, slowly running out of food, medical supplies and fuel. At Stanford, it never happened. On February 17th, the Azerbaijani Student Association hostedan eventabout “truth-finding” and “peace-building” — to which the Armenian Student Association was not invited — and featured exclusively Azerbaijani speakers. They discussed Khojaly — a chapter in the history of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict where Azeris weremassacredby Armenian troops in 1992. This falls in the aftermath of the Sumgait pogrom of 1988 wherehundredsof Armenians were murdered and forced to flee from Azerbaijan. There was no conversation either about the 120,000 Armenians blockaded in Artsakh or the relentless attacks of Azeri troops on Armenian villages. In fact, there was no conversation at all — unless speaking to a mirror counts as such. There is nothing that justifies Khojaly and the murder of innocent civilians. But it is not justifiable to twist, cut up and rearrange history into a convenient narrative presented as scientific truth. I sat in the back of a basement lecture hall of Main Quad as the Azeri panel spoke about what Armenians are like, what our history is and what our problem is. I heard a forensic historian tell the audience that my people have fabricated the age of our ancient cities, that we are still so hung up on the issue of the Armenian Genocide that we view everything as an extension of it, and that we need to shift our “mental map” of Armenia and face reality. He is right. Armenians in Armenia and across the global diaspora are “hung up” on the issue. Our national consciousness processes ethnically targeted attacks from Turkic states as extensions of the genocide because we have yet to receive a proper acknowledgment or apology from Turkey. Because to accept the wrongdoings of the past is to admit to hatred for Armenians. The chapter will never be closed because with every denial we experience an attack on our reality. At Stanford, this denial is rampant and unnoticed. On the 100-year mark of the genocide, April 24th, 2015, Stanford’s Turkish Student Association released a statement titled “The Armenian genocide: The Turkish side of the story.” Thisstatementframes their plea as such: “The Armenian thesis claims that the events constitute a genocide, that the Ottoman government had an official (albeit hidden intent to exterminate the Armenian nation. It makes extensive references to the Holocaust to create the impression that the Armenian Genocide had similar methods and goals and is just as indisputable as the Holocaust. This position is historically not correct.” One of the speakers on the panel, Hakan Yavuz, flown in from the University of Utah, is a recorded denier of the Armenian Genocide. His research is funded by the Turkish Coalition of America, an organization that lobbies for and generates content about genocide denial in the US. At Stanford, Yavuz attempted to represent Truth on the issue of Armenians. A few days after this event, an Azeri news platform rana headline:“Stanford University, home to 17 Nobel laureates, hosted a conference dedicated to Khojaly Genocide”. Although the overtness of this attempt to use Stanford’s reputation to validate the narrative propelled about the conflict is nearly humorous — it is disturbing to see an institution like Stanford presented as a legitimizer of genocide denial. Regardless of the intentions or awareness of the University regarding this issue, it is imperative that it understand the impact of supporting such forms of freedom of expression. The University’s inadequacy to respond to such events was further illuminated when the Armenian Student Association filed a protected identity harm report. The assistant dean of student support simply informed students that past instances of anti-Armenian sentiment have already been recorded at Stanford and that they would be happy to provide us with “a processing circle.” The students continued their efforts by requesting meetings with both the office of the President and the Vice President of student affairs and received no response. So once more, our reality felt illegitimate. Anotherheadlinefollowing the panel read: “Armenians attempt to disrupt the conference held in US on the 31st anniversary of the Khojaly genocide”. This attempted disruption consisted of me asking the organizers of the event why Armenians weren’t invited to an event marketed as being about the “pathway to Azerbaijani-Armenian peace-building.” I was told that it was simply a matter of logistics and the organizers simply didn’t have enough time to invite a wider range of panelists. This last-minute event included speakers flown in from North Carolina University and the University of Utah. Genocide is more than the destruction of land or the murder of people. It is a destruction of identity, an erasure of history and an attack on a people’s collective and personal reality. Thus the violence continues, not just with emptying villages but with every denial of history, with every moment that our culture feels invisible and with every world history class that skips over this history. It continues in the voids of silence. This mass-organized gaslighting is destructive. The invisible nature of Armenian culture in most of the US (save Glendale is in many ways a natural one — it is unrealistic to expect that everyone knows about the complex and nuanced history of a tiny country lost somewhere … in the Middle East? The effects of invisibility, however, run deep. In a Wilbur elevator, my friend began to sing an Armenian folk song. Their voice echoed — “Սիրուն աղջիկ սիրուն յար, եկուր եկուր հոքիս առ …” —sending chills through me. It was almost absurd to hear this music outside of my head, and even more absurd to hear a piece of my culture being experienced by someone who wasn’t Armenian. I don’t know how to be Rima without carrying the weight. Some days all I can do is choose ignorance: to avoid Armenian news sources, avoid conversations with my parents and skip over photos of past Armenian winters. I don’t enjoy passing every day battling to affirm my own reality, convincing myself that my history is real — that I exist. I don’t want to be shocked that my music is worth listening to. I wish I could talk about the genocide as a piece of the past. I wish I could begin to tend to the wounds of the past, begin to heal and let it go. But I cannot because the blood keeps flowing and shows no signs of stopping. At a recent row house party I fell into a conversation with a Turkish girl. “Americans always ask me about the genocide,” she laughed. “It’s so silly, I have to explain to them that’s in the past.” She brushed it off, smiling, with her red solo cup twirling in her hand. “You know there are still things happening in Artsakh right?” “Huh?” “Armenians are still being forced to leave their ethnic lands” “What? I don’t—” And with that, the music swelled and we were swept back into the party. This article is a personal piece and is not associated with the Armenian Student Association."

The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. As I sit at my desk, refreshing the Google Form for tickets to Night of Decadence, the annual Wiess College public party, I think to myself that there has got to be a better way to do this. Over the past couple years, tickets for publics have been distributed mostly through first-come, first-served Google Forms. These have been, to put it lightly, a mess. People sit hunched over their computer, mashing the refresh button repeatedly until Google finally stops serving them the “too many requests” message. Then, a hurried, typo-filled form is submitted, and the wait begins again as people wait to receive their confirmation message after traffic dies down again. Did this agonizing experience even grant a ticket? You won’t know for many more hours. While this process for ticket distribution can be entertaining fuel for the college group chats to gripe about, it is not optimal. Using one specific ticket distribution time results in multiple negative consequences. First, it creates confusing technical situations where people don’t know if their request was even submitted. As the NOD ticket distribution showed, even after submitting their form, Google’s overloaded servers will still tell the user that the form is receiving too many requests. One cannot be sure if theirs went through, unless they’re willing to resubmit and resubmit for another dozen minutes. This creates both intense anxiety about the process on the attendee end, but also anxiety on the side of the socials committees. Every public is a carnival of stress as students have to troubleshoot Google forms that are already being bombarded with hundreds of requests, while simultaneously fanning the flames of anger coming at them from their friends and classmates. Second, the use of first-come, first-served Google Forms hurts anyone who happens to be busy at the time of ticket release. Working a job? In the middle of an exam? Listening to a lecture with a professor who will dock points for using an electronic device? Any of these situations ensure that a student simply cannot get a ticket to a public. While many students today simply skip class or ignore parts of the lecture to acquire their tickets, our ticketing system should not create situations where that is necessary. One’s willingness to disrupt their own education should not be required to attend a party, and our ticketing system should not require it. Instead of distributing tickets through a first-come, first-served Google Form, socials committees at colleges should shift to a lottery based system. Over the course of a day or two, students could submit a Google Form with their information on it. Behind the scenes, the committee should randomly select the students who receive tickets. Additionally, committees could randomly select within colleges or equitably across North and South colleges, ensuring a wide range of students would attend the party. A lottery would resolve both of the issues of the first-come, first-served system. It would ensure that no individual time slot is the most important for getting a ticket, which prevents Google’s servers from being overrun by traffic. It also ensures that anyone who happens to be busy when the form opens isn’t prevented from getting a ticket, because the timing window would be wide enough that anyone could find an opportunity to submit their form. Not only would a lottery reduce stress and add opportunities for students to get tickets, it would also ensure that a wider variety of students could gain access to the ticketing system. Rather than having publics attended by only the students who know how to best navigate the Google Form system, any student who wanted to attend would have an equal opportunity to do so. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2023_59,"Coming of age as a Jewish-American adolescent in the late 1980s, I had seen the U.S. media coverage of the first PalestinianIntifada(uprising against Israeli occupation. I feel that the stakes of the current Israeli-Palestinian violence are much higher and scarier than anything else I’ve experienced since then. This is not only because the scale ofcivilian deathssince Oct. 7 on both sides is so much larger. It is also because there had been no serious peace process to try to end the more than century-long conflict for years before Oct. 7. Yet largely absent from the debate on the conflict since Oct. 7 in most major U.S. media is acknowledgement of the conflict’s extreme asymmetry — a fact rooted in historical reality that the state of Israel was the creation ofa settler-colonial projectknown as Zionism. There is no doubt that Zionism emerged in large part as a defensive response to centuries of virulent European antisemitism and the terrible oppression of Jews that culminated in the Nazi Holocaust, a horrendous genocide that wiped out 12 members of my great-grandmother’s family. This, however, does not negate the fact that Zionists, including their founding father Theodore Herzl,sawthe establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine through a European settler-colonial lens. Like their brethren in neighboring Ottoman provinces, who became nation-states after the First World War (i.e. Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq , the indigenous Arabs of Palestine wereforginga national identity when Herzl’sFirst Zionist Congresschose Ottoman-ruled Palestine as the site of a future Jewish homeland in 1897. Upon the demise of the Ottoman Empire in 1917, Great Britain imposed a mandate (temporary neocolonial rule over Palestine. Unlike neighboring mandates, however, Palestine was promised to the Jews as a homeland in a letter from Britain’s then-Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to British Zionist leader Lionel Walter Rothschild. Known as theBalfour Declaration, the letter referred to the Arabs of Palestine, who had made up90%of the Palestine mandate’s population, as “existing non-Jewish communities,” whose civil and religious rights should not be prejudiced. The letter also granted national rights exclusively to the 10% minority of Jewish settlers. Effectively, this “imperial edict” declared that there would be no independent state of Palestine for its majority indigenous Arab inhabitants. Zionism was and is a complex ideology, movement and raison d’être of Israel as a nation-state. The major element of Zionism that made possible the founding of Israel was theexpulsionof 750,000 Palestinians from their homes during the first major Arab-Israeli War in 1948 — commonly known as the “Nakba,” or catastrophe in Arabic. After the second Arab-Israeli war of 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip, along with the Syrian Golan Heights and the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula (the latter having been returned to Egypt in 1979 . Since 1967, Israel has been steadfastly committed to Jewish settlement of the West Bank, and, until 2005, the Gaza Strip. Not only has this commitment continuously and forcibly dispossessed Palestinians of their land and water, it is also a gross violation of their internationally recognized sovereignty per dozens ofU.N. resolutions. In 1976, an international consensus emerged on a two-state solution in a U.N. General Assemblyreportstating “that the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, was a prerequisite for peace in the Middle East.” This Palestinian state was to be established in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza, which consisted of 22% of historic Palestine. The secular Palestine Liberation Organization joined this consensus, prompting Israel tosupportthe precursor of Hamas in the late 1970s and 1980s as a counterweight to the more moderate PLO. This was a fateful decision that helped to create Hamas in 1987. U.S.-supported Israeli elites across the political spectrum have consistently rejected an authentic two-state solution in favor of settlement expansion into Palestinian-occupied territories, even during the longOslo peace processof the 1990s. The current Netanyahu government is only the latest, although the most extreme, instantiation of this consistent policy. The persistent demand in the U.S. media and among politicians that Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims condemn the war crimes of Hamas is rarely accompanied by a parallel demand that Jews in Israel and abroad condemn the illegality and brutality of the now 56-year Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the 16-year blockade of Gaza. The structural violence of the occupation oftenterrorizesPalestinians through collective punishment in flagrant violation of international law. The current punishment consists not only of indiscriminatebombingof densely populated urban areas in the tiny coastal enclave of Gaza, but also the issuing of an evacuation order that forced more than a million Gazans —50%of whom are children— to immediately leave Northern Gaza, as Israel prepared to commence its major ground invasion. As former President Jimmy Carter, who presided over the landmark 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, has pointed out, Israel’s rule over Palestine clearlyresemblesSouth African apartheid in form and practice prior to 1994. And lest we forget, Nelson Mandelaendorsedarmed resistance against the structural violence inflicted by apartheid in South Africa andsupportedan authentic Palestinian state — one with borders along the pre-1967 border and with full sovereignty over its resources free of Jewish settlements. Hamas is certainly not the moral equivalent of the African National Congress, but neither is the current government of Israel, whose defense minister after Hamas’ attackdeclaredthat “we are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly” in Gaza. Ignoring or downplaying the structural violence of occupation while dehumanizing its victims only ensures that the civilians of Israel and Palestine will continue to suffer. But it is Palestinian civilians, especially those in the besieged and bombarded Gaza, who will suffer exponentially more. Until Israel and its superpowerU.S.backer recognize this and fundamentally change their decades-long status quo narrative, there will very likely be neither justice nor peace in Israel and Palestine for generations to come.

crimson_2023_55,"Last month,a gunman opened firein a restaurant and a bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine. He killed at least 18 people and injured 13 others. In the wake of the shooting, advocates and lawmakers have called for a federal ban on assault weapons. Still, we all know the typical cycle of American reactivity — mass shooting, followed by outrage, followed by nothing. Not only is our gun problem a uniquely American issue, but our lack of action is uniquely American as well. In 1996, it took the Australian prime minister 12 days after the Port Arthur mass shooting to begin a total overhaul of the nation’s gun laws. In New Zealand in 2019, it took a few weeks after the mass shooting in Christchurch for the Parliament to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons nationwide. In the United States, it’s been almost 11 years (yes — years since the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, and our Congress has hardly scratched the surface of the problem. More than 357,000elementary, middle, and high school students have experienced gun violence at school since the Columbine High School mass shooting in 1999. Horrifyingly, gun violence was the leading cause of death in children ages 1-19 years in 2020 and 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s not entirely accurate to say that Congress has done nothing. After the 2022 shooting in Uvalde, Texas, President Joe Biden signed theBipartisan Safer Communities Act, which expanded background checks for prospective gun buyers and provided funds for state intervention initiatives such as mental health courts and red flag laws. However, we have yet to see significant progress at the federal level, including practical measures like closing the “gun show”background check loophole, instituting arobust secure storage law, allowing petitions for anextreme risk protection order, or even banning assault weapons. In 2021, I survived a mass shooting atOxford High School— the deadliest in the state of Michigan. Four of my classmates — Hana St. Juliana, Tate Myre, Justin Shilling, and Madisyn Baldwin — were murdered. Several others were injured, including a teacher. Nearly 2,000 others were traumatized. I distinctly remember my classmates and me barring the door shut and arming ourselves with makeshift weapons, including tape dispensers, scissors, and even a hockey stick. What should have been a typical day reading a short story in International Baccalaureate English turned into sheer terror, which has marked my life to this day. I am not afraid to admit how the shooting has impacted my daily life. I now experience a tendency towards fight or flight responses, a constant urge to look over my shoulder, and recurring brain fog. After the shooting, wetook actionin Michigan. However, in other states, where thegun lobbyseems to have a tight grip on Republican lawmakers andgun violenceruns rampant, how do we move forward? At the federal level, Congress keeps us sitting ducks in schools, homes, and communities. It is only a matter of time before something like what happened in Maine last month happens again elsewhere. I don’t mean to seem pessimistic, but we’re too often urged to accept the dark reality that is the United States. We don’t have to, though. Gun violence is often framed as an issue of mental well-being or unfettered gun access. But why don’t we also view it as a human rights issue? Amnesty International hasreleased a reportdetailing how mass shootings, specifically at school, can disrupt a child’s right to an education. That right, protected in theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, means that each state has a “prime responsibility” to ensure that all people “are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice.” Between survivors and supporters, we must take this reframed issue into our own hands in new ways — not only through advocacy but also through litigation. In August, a court ruled in favor ofstudents in Montanawho had sued the state, arguing that their right to a clean and healthful climate was violated by a state law that forbade officials from weighing the environmental impacts of large projects. Now, the state must consider climate damage when it approves projects. Gun violence prevention advocates and activists must be willing to do the same — not only to hold our government accountable, but also to demonstrate that our right to life, the most fundamental right of all, takes precedence over the right to own any firearm and use it irresponsibly. If we are to continue on the path we’re on, we risk creating an even more apathetic United States — a nation too numb to do anything about the growing gun violence in our communities. Even on our campus, nested within liberal Massachusetts, we cannot afford complacency. It is time to act in ways we have only begun to explore — because it’s not a matter of if someone will experience the effects of gun violence in their life; it’s a matter of when. Dylan J. Morris ’27 lives in Wigglesworth Hall. He is the co-founder of No Future Without Today, an organization advocating for student safety through gun reform."
stanforddaily_2023_22,"Like most students in the class of 2024, I began my time as a Stanford student online, living not in my dorm room but my bedroom. During the early phases of the pandemic, it was The Daily that initially bound me to Stanford. It was an island in a sea of Zoom rooms and Canvas posts. At that time, I understood The Daily to be simply a club. It was a place to make friends and do so while reporting the news. But I quickly learned that The Daily is so much more than just a student organization. Unlike nearly any other student-run operation on campus, The Daily is its own business — a fully-independent California public benefit corporation with 501(c (3 status. That independence was solidified a half-century ago this month, and we’ve created a special edition of The Daily, which you can find in print all around campus, to commemorate our journey since then. At The Daily, we value our independence. It allows us to dive fearlessly into stories of great risk and importance. It gives us the freedom to define our own journalistic and business objectives, grow and learn, and improve. For as much as The Daily’s mission is journalistic, it is also educational. Many staffers enter The Daily having never written journalism before and graduate to work at the top newsrooms in the world. Our position as an independent student newspaper is unique in that all of our staff are direct members of the community we report on. We sit across from our readers at dining halls. They are classmates in our courses and hallmates in our dorms. Our readers are our professors, our administrators, our parents and our alums. When we tell a story well, it has the opportunity to get the people around us thinking, to turn heads and start conversations. And if we tell a story poorly, it is our own community we may hurt; the one we care about so dearly, for it is our own. At The Daily, we don’t take the responsibility of reporting on our own community lightly. To be fully ingrained within the Stanford community puts us closer to the stories we tell, but it also means there is additional pressure to do a great job telling them. At the risk of being cliché, I feel inclined to quote the first edition of The Daily, then called “The Daily Palo Alto.” “True it is that The Daily will not make a great university, but just as true is it that The Daily is one of the signs of a great university. This is not a paper by a few individuals, acting in a private capacity. It is the organ of the students of Stanford University.” This issue hopes to celebrate this important legacy and mission with exciting stories. The articles vary: one historicizes our independence and another details The Daily’s Supreme Court case against the Palo Alto Police Department. One piece recounts our printing of a fake Cal paper following the infamous 1982 Big Game, and another celebrates Daily joy by chronicling the history of our crossword. We let alums take the mic, recounting their own experiences in the issue’s opinions and Grind pieces. As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of The Daily’s independence from Stanford, I hope that our community will join us in reflecting on The Daily and its core mission. Most importantly, I hope the Stanford community will continue to hold us to account for our words, push us to improve, and assist us in maintaining our independence for as long as there is a Stanford for The Daily to report on.

ubyssey_2023_11,"Sept. 12, 2023 Written byIman Janmohamed Dear Iman, I’m in way too many classes right now and need to drop some. One of the classes seems super fun, but doesn’t apply to my major. What should I do? A tale as old as time itself. To drop, or not to drop. That is the question. Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer. The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune... You can tell I’m an English major, huh? But seriously, figuring out which class to drop is always super tough — you pick classes based on how much you anticipate you’ll like them, and then suddenly you have to pick one of them to get chopped. I’m notorious for attending a million classes in the first week, then really only ending up in about three or four of them. I need to get a feel for things, get a sample (in the next Ask Iman — how school is like Costco and I like to shop around before I buy anything, so why would classes be any different? I totally understand being in a super fun class, yet the subject matter itself has little (or no relevance to your degree, and having a snoozefest of a class that you need to graduate. Which one you drop/stay in is totally up to you — but here’s my advice. If you’re nearing the end of your degree, if a class is a degree requirement that you need for the next year or if a class is a prerequisite, don’t drop it. As much as your fun exciting elective is fun and exciting, it’s not worth stressing out about not having your science requirement completed well into your senior year. If you’re in your last year and want to drop a required class, make sure that you can take it the next semester or have a class that your advising office said can replace that course. But remember, you’ll have to take that class eventually, so might as well do it now. But let’s say the elective class is super cool. Like SO cool. You’ll never be able to take a class as interesting ever again, the professor is an award-winner at the top of their field and the class has no final exam (flex . Should you take it at the expense of not completing your requirements? It depends. If this class can contribute to your elective credits and really is something you’ll never get to do again. I’d stay in the class — elective credits are required credits, so all’s well that ends well. But if it won’t count toward that, or has little relevance to your future or interests (even though it’s a cool class , take the L, drop it and try to enjoy your required class. Life is all about balance — maybe you won’t get to take a super silly elective credit this semester, but you will get to later. Maybe you’ll get out of taking a required course you’ve been dreading, but you’ll have to finish the class eventually.

crimson_2023_111,"Housing Day is a venerated tradition — and one that entails a really fun morning. That won’t be the case for two of us this year, as we’ll be in class, taking midterm exams at 10:30 a.m. This isn’t the first time students’ academic commitments have prevented them from having fun. This type of conflict is sometimes unavoidable and, for the sake of our education, often a good thing. But on Housing Day, such conflicts are decidedly avoidable — which day a midterm takes place is simply a matter of professor choice. Today, we urge our professors to think twice. To be clear, we know that academics take priority over partying — our professors were likely thinking along those lines when they scheduled our tests. But at Harvard, with its near-constant slog, why must we sit for exams on one of thesingularly most fun daysof the year? We don’t agree that any trade-off between academics and Housing Day must exist. Most classes meet twice a week for thirteen weeks. What in-class midterm couldn’t be moved to the class before, or the one before that, or even the Thursday after Spring Break? It’s hard to imagine how giving an exam on Tuesday and holding an ordinary lecture on Housing Day would seriously compromise the course’s academic continuity. And if tweaking the date of a midterm would amount to choosing fun over school, we’re hard-pressed to imagine how a professor could make any accommodations for their students without seemingly putting school second. You may be wondering why we’re making such a stink out of an inconveniently scheduled test. “Stop whining!” But that very attitude betrays a disconcerting willingness to allow treasured traditions to fall by the wayside in the name of academics. It brings us to the far deeper roots of our strong feelings against Housing Day midterms. Fundamentally, Harvard’s students are fun, and its culture is not. This isn’t a shocking revelation. It manifests itself nearly everywhere in student life — including at last fall’s Harvard-Yale Game, perhaps the only event to share Housing Day’s pomp, when the administration banned independent student tailgates under the guise of student safety, providing only a highly restrictive and, if we may say so,lame tailgating option. Various Houses also banned all dormitory parties for the duration of the weekend, making us wonder whether The Game was meant to be an intercollegiate book club. Harvard studentsresponded exactly how they should have: by gathering en masse for an unofficial tailgate, simultaneously highlighting the frivolousness of the administration’s safety rationale and our capacity to create fun. We’ve framed this tailgate as a triumph of students over the administration, and it was. But we rarely see that side of Harvard — boisterous, spontaneous, joyful. In many ways, Harvard-Yale was the exception that proves the rule. Much of the time, we students perpetuate Harvard’s culture of non-fun. We let it drape over us like an inescapable cloak and we accede to its norms as if we were powerless to create the culture we all want. The administration’s helicopter parenting and the inherited social ecosystem of Harvard mix with students apathy to these circumstances to create a deadly cocktail. We’ve heard alumni stories of past freshman pastimes, such asplaying Donkey Kong by rolling empty kegsdown the stairs of Weld Hall, that tell us there was a time before the culture of non-fun. While it’s true that many of these traditions, likely including the above, have been lost due to legitimate safety concerns, we’re making a broader point. Who could imagine Harvard administrators allowing anything like that to happen today, or students even trying to engage in such spontaneous play? Since then, it seems like our imagination, our conception of fun, has narrowed. Our campus’ vitality has withered. We’ve stopped seeing this kind of fun, the kind that doesn’t take place only on Friday and Saturday nights, as integral to the college experience. We’ve sacrificed the nonroutine, the momentary, the improvised types of fun, treating these experiences as an expendable part of our packed schedules. It feels like too much effort to go to the Beanpot championship game when you could be working on a problem set instead. Professors didn’t create Harvard’s rigid culture, and they won’t save us from it by moving their midterms from Housing Day. But moving exams isn’t trivial; small acts are necessary to induce big changes. A similar effort is needed from all of us. We shouldn’t accept the Harvard that was handed down to us as if it were the way things have to be. We owe it to ourselves, and those who follow, to create the environment we want to live in — and finally destroy Harvard’s unfortunate culture of non-fun.

stanforddaily_2023_75,"Content warning: This message references anti-Asian violence/racial violence. Earlier this quarter, a man was found and detained on campus after threatening to enact violence against Stanford’s Vietnamese community. After posting a series of online threats and racially charged comments against Stanford’s Vietnamese students, the individual physically showed up on campus — and was located while making active threats of direct harm to a graduate student. Yet, despite the severity and proximity of the threat of violence during this event, Stanford never issued a University-wide announcement about what occurred. In the aftermath, we in the Vietnamese community are left wondering: are students meant to bear the responsibility of keeping our community safe and informed? Throughout the month of March, Stanford’s Vietnamese Student Association (SVSA received a series of racially violent and hateful comments on its public Instagram account. The anonymous comments expressed strong self-loathing and hate towards the poster’s own Vietnamese identity and included death threats towards members of SVSA. One comment stated, “If you carry a Vietnamese last name, you will die first. This is a promise.” Others included threats such as “You’re not coming home” and “I will be pulling up to your events in person and exacting my revenge.” SVSA leaders notified the Department of Public Safety (DPS after receiving each wave of hateful comments, asking for guidance on whether it was safe to proceed with the association’s annual Culture Night show. DPS determined in coordination with Stanford’s Threat Assessment team that there was not an immediate threat to SVSA and indicated that they believed the threats were not racially motivated. DPS identified a possible suspect on the East Coast and advised that SVSA was safe to move forward with Culture Night with additional security measures. During this exchange with DPS, several town halls were held where student community leaders bore a majority of the stress and responsibility for responding to this threat, with little to no support from senior University leadership. The situation escalated in early April when SVSA leaders were notified that the non-Stanford affiliated suspect had been discovered on campus, and in fact had likely been at Stanford for several weeks. The suspect was detained by DPS on April 6 after posting a threat on social media towards a Stanford graduate student, which indicated his real-time location at the Graduate School of Business. The suspect, confirmed as a Vietnamese-American male, admitted to posting the aforementioned threats on the SVSA Instagram account and shared he held a grudge against Vietnamese people. While the suspect had no weapons in his possession, he was transferred to a hospital for evaluation out of concern for his mental health and wellbeing. Three days later, the suspect was released from psychiatric hold and issued a “stay-away order” from Stanford. As of April 14, the individual has allegedly returned to his family on the East Coast. Amidst intense concerns of physical and psychological safety, SVSA leaders made the difficult decision to cancel SVSA Culture Night. This event has been severely distressing and traumatizing for many members of Stanford’s Vietnamese community, particularly those that were directly threatened and those who bore the responsibility of urging the University to respond. Anxiety and fear gripped our community as the threat of racial violence hung over us for over a month. Repeated online threats culminated in the physical presence of a suspect on campus. However, despite the severity of the event, Stanford has yet to issue a University-wide announcement about what occurred or denounce this act of racial hate and intolerance. This left students feeling isolated and unsafe as many different systems and people representing the University continue to fail us. Though acommunity letterfrom the Asian American Activities Center (A3C was sent to Asian-interest mailing lists, no announcement was sent to the University at large, leaving the majority of students, many of whom are themselves a part of the Vietnamese community, wholly uninformed and largely alone to deal with the impact of harm perpetrated. When Stanford fails to bring attention to anti-Asian violence, they fail to acknowledge the very present racial hate that persists on this campus. They minimize the lived experiences and concerns of marginalized communities of color, and they endanger students who deserve to be informed about threats of violence against their community. Events such as these affect our community at large, and the University should have published a University-wide announcement rebuking racial violence and hate, while affirming Stanford as an institution that values and supports students of all marginalized identities to feel safe and to thrive. Their failure to publicly denounce this act of racial hate signals that the University does not take concerns like this seriously. It minimizes the extent of the harm done to our community. And it sends a message that anti-Asian violence is an Asian/Asian American issue, not a University-wide one. The University’s silence equates to complicity. May was Asian Pacific American (APA Heritage Month, and in the aftermath of these events, those of us in Stanford’s Vietnamese community are reflecting on the nature of anti-Asian violence that has and continues to occur on this campus. We wonder how and why Stanford leadership and systems failed to really see and protect students. When the University remains silent on an event such as this, it is difficult to feel that the University takes transgressions against its APA community seriously. This event has raised serious questions about the University’s “selectiveness” in which issues and communities merit attention from the highest levels of University leadership, and which are ignored. It is clear that Stanford prioritizes protecting its reputation. But how bad do things have to get before the University can’t ignore it any longer? How severe will the next hate incident against APA communities on campus be, and will the University remain silent then, too?

crimson_2023_146,"Ubiquitous. Pedagogical. Capricious. Quintessential. It seems as if long, winding words follow us everywhere at Harvard, popping up in every interaction we have or overhear. They are snuck into conversation offhandedly, thrown in as evidence of intellectualism and success, as if they prove one’s worth. Yes, of course, that person must belong at Harvard — they know how to easily and tactfully use the word “embourgeoisement.” There’s an image of a Harvard student as someone who’s been using words like “sesquipedalian” for years and for whom faltering in their speech is unheard of. They can give presentations with ease and always have an obscure word on hand to express a concept that certainly already has an easier term. “Smart” becomes “perspicacious,” “strange” becomes “selcouth,” and “bragging” becomes “gasconading.” A large portion of our existence on this campus feels like a race wheresounding smartis enough to get you to the finish line. But we come from different backgrounds, diverse enough to make any standard of ‘smart speech’ wholly unfair. I first encountered the word “pedagogical” two months ago at a Crimson Editorial meeting where it was thrown around rapidly. I then spent two minutes Googling it, and was thoroughly disappointed when I realized it just meant “relating to teaching.” Not all of us grew up in heavily academic environments, where learning to accommodate this kind of speech came about as naturally as learning to walk. I can’t speak to the experience of having an accent or learning second, third, and fourth languages; I haven’t experienced those unfair struggles that may arise in our predominantly English-speaking university. But still, I know the fear of not sounding ‘smart enough’ all too well. I find the battles of word choice that I often observe in academic settings startling, aware that my main focus when speaking, as someone with a speech impediment, is to get the words out at all. Sentences become inflated with fancy words for academic validation and approval, their meaning unchanging but their understandability decreasing. I worry that my inability to compete in these fast-paced, complicated word exchanges will result in a label of incompetency, regardless of how accomplished I am. It is impossible for me to accept the fact that my and others’ disfluent speech has and can harm perceptions of our intelligence. In environments like ours, people worry intensely over presentations they have to give, citing the possibility of stuttering as their worst fear. If they do end up faltering, they sit down nervously, begging others to tell them that it wasn’t noticeable. (It almost never is. We focus too much on how we speak, and too little on the actual content of what we are saying and sharing with others. Because what good is intellectual thought if it cannot be understood by your audience? What good is debate if the primary thought on your opponent’s mind is not the topic itself, but how to sound smarter than you? Our commitment to critical thinking seems to decrease the more we realize that we can get our validation from simply sounding like we understand. What wrongs could come from using simpler words, besides missing the chance to momentarily inflate one’s ego? I’m not advocating for the eradication of all big words; I understand that their use in professional fields is inevitable and valuable at times. Public speaking skills are often very important, and people will always see value in the ability to eloquently explain confusing topics in ways that are complex yet necessary to their field. What I am saying, instead, is that how we speak says little about our intellect and much more about our past and identity. If we want to truly commit to making ourselves and this institution more inclusive, the expectation that we use fancy words must go. Sharing ideas should not scare people into silence as they worry over whether how they sound will meet our arbitrary standards of worthiness. These standards are hard to escape, though, even for people who realize they exist. I apologize for any excessively big words I’ve used in this piece — seldom can I elude the ceaseless desire to be perceived as intellectually competent. In better words, I too sometimes want to ‘sound smart,’ and being on this campus isn’t making my situation any better. April S. Keyes ‘26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Pennypacker Hall."

thetech_mit_2023_8,"Ten years ago, the city of Boston came under attack. Four lives were lost in the ensuing events: Martin Richard, Lingzi Lu, Krystle Campbell, and MIT police officer Sean Collier. We shall never forget the memory of these individuals, particularly that of Officer Collier for making the ultimate sacrifice to protect MIT and the greater community. The events of April 15, 2013, live on in all of us Bostonians. A few weeks ago in class, my health policy professor choked up when she highlighted how Boston hospitals were mobilized to save the victims of the bombings. At a service held at the Sean Collier Memorial on April 18, Officer Collier’s brother Andrew delivered a poignant statement honoring his brother. These tragedies occurred ten years ago, but proved our strength as a city to transcend raw emotions to unite. Boston is truly a city on the hill, an emblem of this nation and the values that we represent. We sowed the seeds for the independence of this country. We laid down the tenets of American democracy. These bombings were meant to strike fear into us Bostonians. But they did not shake who we are. Through this tragedy, the city revealed its true character that has manifested itself time and time again: a place of adaptability, resilience, and heart. Since then, the city has faced numerous other challenges: the pandemic, racial injustice, political polarization, and some Nor’easters. Having lived in the Boston area for over eleven years, I am proud to call this city home.

state_press_2023_38,"ASU students who participate in or attend drag shows could have their creative outlet taken from them. Republican senators have introduced three bills aimed at limiting and regulating drag shows in Arizona. Drag performances have been heralded as a hallmark of queer culture for decades, bringing people together. Used as a vessel for social justice, advocacy or entertainment, the art form is diverse and ever-growing. As drag has acquired more mainstream attention, though, it has also acquired more critics. Recently proposed state legislation targets Arizona s drag community, which threatens the creative expression of ASU s LGBTQ+ students. These bills affect both drag performers and their audiences. By limiting this art form, the legislation is clearly aiming to limit the expression of LGBTQ+ identities. Drag refers to the art form in which a person dresses in clothing and makeup to exaggerate femininity, masculinity or other gender expressions. This session, Arizona lawmakers may vote on four bills, Senate bills 1026, 1028, 1030 and 1698. In all likelihood, these pieces of legislation will not make it past the desk of Gov. Katie Hobbs, who stated during a news conference on Feb. 2 she would veto them. However, Hobbs should not have to spend her time in office vetoing bigoted regulations. Legislators should draft bills that could truly make a positive impact in Arizona. From the homelessness crisis toimproving our public education system, there are several more important issues to address in Arizona than policing queer expression. Senate Bill 1026, introduced by Sen. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, aims to eliminate the ability of state moneys to be used to fund drag shows performed for people under 18. Senate Bill 1028, introduced by Sen. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale, wishes to go even further to abolish drag shows that target minors by banning people from engaging in adult cabaret performances on public property or in the presence of a minor. Senate Bill 1030, also introduced by Kern, limits the times at which drag shows are allowed to be performed and requires permits for drag shows and performers. It also aims to categorize establishments where drag shows are performed as adult-oriented businesses. Senate Bill 1698, introduced by Sen. Justine Wadsack, R-Tucson, and Reps. Rachel Jones, R-Tucson, and Cory McGarr, R-Tucson, aims to completely criminalize the act of performing drag in front of a minor. In response, members of the LGBTQ+ community held a protest at the Arizona State Capitol on Jan. 22 to show disapproval of how the Legislature has treated them. If these bills are enacted, ASU students could be directly affected. ASU s Downtown Phoenix campus LGBTQ+ group, Confetti, has plans to host a drag show on campus during Arizona Pride Week in April. Under SB 1026, anyone under 18 would not be able to attend drag events, Confetti s show included, and performances could not be held on public property. This event and others like it may be negatively impacted by the bills targeting drag. Censoring students who do drag and other drag performers is blatantly homophobic, said Sophie Warnock, a freshman member of Confetti majoring in fashion. Queer students should not have their identities stifled by our government. Throughout all four bills, eliminating the ability of minors to attend drag shows is a pervasive theme. At face value, this could be seen as an attempt to steer children away from humor used in drag that could be considered crude and vulgar. However, one must look at the ulterior motives shared by legislators when they proposed these bills. Proposing legislation to protect children from being exposed to age-inappropriate content is one thing. Using children as a scapegoat to incur homophobic regulations onto constituents is another. I find it upsetting that they are using children to try and criminalize drag, Warnock said. Most drag shows are not even marketed to children in the first place. SB 1030 says a drag show shall cannot occur between the hours of 1 and 8 a.m. on Monday through Saturday and between the hours of 1 a.m. and noon on Sunday. Out of all the contents in the three proposed bills, this is the most blatant attempt to cut down on LGBTQ+ expression. My main issue is with the Sunday hours, which could very well harm the drag scene in Arizona. Homophobia has no place in legislation.

crimson_2023_14,"As we write this op-ed,more than 150 Israelis— including men, women, and children — are reportedly being held hostage in tunnels deep beneath the Gaza Strip, and at leastanother 1,200are reported dead. On Saturday morning, during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, we woke up to a nightmare in Israel. In addition to firing thousands of missiles reaching as far as Tel Aviv, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad had launched a grisly surprise attack on Israeli civilian communities near Gaza. For many Jews like us who observe the Sabbath and could not use electronics, the sparse bits of news that reached us shook us to our core. We finally opened our phones after the holiday to scenes of a murderous rampage.At least 260 revelershad been shot dead at a music festival.A bomb was droppedfrom a Hamas drone onto an Israeli ambulance. First responders and Israel Defense Forces soldiers found children and babies who were burned beyond recognition. Parents witnessed their children being grabbed from their homes and carted into Gaza. One child was filmed beingbeaten with sticksand called a “filthy Jew” as he cried for his mother. Hamas fighters brutally murdered an Israeli grandmother and then used her private Facebook account topost the gruesome footageon her feed. A Holocaust survivor in a wheelchairwas kidnapped. Young Israeli women were raped andparaded naked through Gaza City. All of this happened in the country founded as the safe haven for the Jewish people. Harvard’s Jewish community and the entire Jewish world are in shock. For us, this issue isn’t just political — it’s personal. During services at Harvard Chabad on Saturday morning, an Israeli student left the room, only to reappear later holding a suitcase. He had been called back to Israel for emergency reserve service. Other members of our Jewish communities have family and friends who were killed or are missing. For many Jews, things are scary back home, too. At an anti-Israel rally on Sunday in New York, a swastika was spotted as demonstrators chanted “700,” a gruesome reference to the reported Israeli death toll (which has since risen . Protesters outside the Sydney Opera House reportedlyshouted “gas the Jews.”Security is being stepped up at synagogues and Jewish institutions around the world, including on our own campus. So, when dozens of Harvard student organizations signed a statement released by the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee saying they “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence,” we found ourselves at a loss for words. This invasion is the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust, but our peers seem to be justifying these heinous murders by arguing that the Israeli government is “the only one to blame.” Now, more than ever, is the time to stand by the Jewish community. We recognize the incredible suffering that this war will inflict upon all Middle Easterners, including both Israelis and Palestinians. The indescribable pain of losing a family member does not discriminate based on nationality. But mourning the loss of Palestinian life must not preclude naming Israel as the target of this attack and calling Hamas what it is: a terror organization whose leadership has explicitly called for Palestinians to “cut off the heads of the Jews with knives.” These attacks have also come at a great cost to Palestinians and Arabs across Gaza and Israel. For example, one of our Arabic teachers has a cousin whose home in Israel was hit by a rocket. European countries are reviewing or suspending aid to the Palestinians. Dozens of Bedouins have beenwounded, killed, or kidnapped. Finally, let us be clear: Hamas and the State of Israel must not be judged as morally equivalent. Israel is a country with respect for democracy and the rule of law. It regularly warns Palestinian civilians to evacuate before launching airstrikes. It prosecutes its citizens and soldiers when they commit crimes against Palestinians. Hamas, on the other hand, is designated by most of the West as a terrorist organization. It murders Israelis and Jews not as a response to any specific Israeli policies, but because it believes Israel has no right to exist — that there are no Israeli “civilians.” We thank University President Claudine Gay for hercondemnation of Hamas’attack. We call on the entire Harvard community to condemn the PSC’s statement for what it is: a justification of horrific terror attacks on the Jewish people and Israel. Please join us as we pray for an end to terrorism, the safe return of hostages to their families, and peace in Israel and the entire Middle East. In the meantime, check on your Jewish and Israeli friends. It’s not political to ask someone if their family is safe.

stanforddaily_2023_63,"I, along with hundreds of other Jewish students at Stanford, woke up last weekend to the earth-shattering news that over a thousand of our brothers and sisters in Israel were senselessly slaughtered by Hamas terrorists. Like many of my fellow students, I immediately looked to the news to find relevant information about the terror that took place. TheNew York Times,Wall Street JournalandWashington Postall provided the horrible details of the attacks and on-the-ground testimonies of infants slaughtered, women raped and dead bodies paraded in the streets of Gaza. When I looked to The Daily, however, I saw a front page op-ed titled “From the Community | Stanford Students for Justice in Palestine” written by SJP leadership rationalizing the attacks. The op-ed stated the importance of putting the “attack” in “context” “as the world witnesses the atrocities committed in Palestine.” Authoring this article in the aftermath of the recent terrorism is not only emotionally tone deaf but also morally reprehensible for failing to acknowledge the loss of life and instead attributing blame to the victims. Those who author such articles should be held responsible for their actions. Accountability is key to preventing the wanton disregard of norms of decency that should guide university discourse. Those who seek to influence our classmates should be held to a higher standard and be forced to reckon with the impact of their influence on our community. As a law student, I celebrate open discourse. I enjoy discussions about hotbed issues and seek out opinions different from mine. But writing this article before the blood of innocent children dries is appalling. It displays no humane mutual respect and should not be endorsed by The Daily or any other organization. I am sure that the leader of SJP does not speak for all SJP members. In fact, his support and his rationalizing of Hamas’ actions this weekend likely indicate that he is not the right person to be leading an organization that is supposed to value human rights. He should salvage any remaining shreds of his dignity by stepping down from SJP and issuing an apology for his offensive article. His lack of empathy is not only directed toward a people who, just two generations ago, fought for their existence, but also toward his fellow classmates who aspire to foster an environment of respect for human life and the destruction of evil. Palestinians do not deserve to carry the same fate as Hamas terrorists. Misguided statements insinuating that Hamas acts as a “resistance” for the Palestinian people weakens the Palestinian cause. It risks creating association between helpless Palestinians and Hamas, which is an authoritarianterroristorganizationbeholden to Iran. SJP does not have to stand alongside baby murderers and rapists to support the Palestinian cause, and even if they choose to, they certainly should have enough self-awareness and common decency to still acknowledge the terrible loss of life that took place last weekend. The time has come for leaders who serve their constituents and not their own egos. I call on SJP leadership to resign immediately, apologize for last week’s op-ed and acknowledge that they were not speaking for all of the organization’s members when they issued their statement.

crimson_2023_150,"Harvard as we know it has come to an end. As each class is admitted without affirmative action in place, the Harvard that I applied to will slowly wither away, dying the day that the Class of 2027 graduates. After all, they will likely be remembered as the last diverse class to attend Harvard. As a result of the Supreme Court’s decision striking down affirmative action, race can now only be considered in college admissions indirectly, such as when an applicant details specific experiences of racial discrimination in their admissions essays. As colleges nationwide struggle to make sense of their now-shattered admissions systems, one question looms over them: What can they do to pick up the pieces? Both Students for Fair Admissions — which prevailed in the case — and a concurring member of the decision’s majority suggested that universities like Harvard could maintain diversity by adjusting their admissions policies to consider an applicant’s socioeconomic status. Such an approach, which islong overdue, may well be universities’ best option in a post-affirmative action world — it could allow colleges to account for the United States’ educational inequality, stratified by race and socioeconomic status. Even still, it is clear that educational disparities cannot and should not be reduced to a purely socioeconomic issue. As of 2019, the average primarily white school district — that is, in which over 75 percent of students are white — received $2,226 more in overall funding than the average school primarily attended by students of color, according to public education nonprofit EdBuild. Worse yet, even only including districts with poverty rates over 20 percent, primarily white school districts still received an average of $1,487 more per student than their primarily non-white counterparts. Though the Supreme Court may try, there’s no denying not only the prevalence ofracism in the classroombut also its pronounced effects on students’ mental health, ability to engage in the classroom, and social isolation. Similarly, students of color are farmore likely to be suspendedfor the same behavior as their white peers, starting as early as early as preschool. Unsurprisingly, the end result is an education system where equally intelligent students of color routinely perform worse on standardized tests and receive worse grades. Without affirmative action, these classroom inequalities will reign over admissions, unable to be accounted for unless a student treats their personal statement and supplemental essays as a laundry list of their experiences with racism. The painful truth is, the short-lived era of diversity on the college campus is about to draw to a close. Given the omnipresence of racism in the American education system, colleges simply can’t put a student’s accomplishments in proper context without considering race in admissions. As a result, race-blind admissions will inherently favor white students. We’ve already seen this disaster play out before. When California outlawed affirmative action policies in its public universities in 1996, its flagship colleges saw an immediate dropoff in on-campus diversity. After well over twenty years of University of California-led efforts to pursue diversity with affirmative action outlawed, students of color remain drastically underrepresented. While the UC schools reached a peak of 37 percent of students belonging to underrepresented backgrounds in 2016, this was still woefully inadequate given that 56 percent of graduating high school students in California came from these backgrounds. And it’s not as if students of color weren’t pursuing higher education: While they are underrepresented at the more prestigious UC schools, Black and Latine students are overrepresented at the less prestigious California State University schools, which offer less financial aid, fewer job opportunities, and lower graduation rates. Without affirmative action, we can expect the exact same outcome nationwide. Unable to consider a student’s race, admissions offices will be forced to compare students’ resumes without the full context of the privilege and inequality that informed them. With today’s decision, the Supreme Court’s conservative justices have crafted a college admissions landscape effectively stacked against students of color. While there will still be students of color who manage to win the upward battle that is Harvard admissions, it’s clear that the days of a diverse Harvard are coming to a close. SFFA’s lawyers themselves have conceded that the number of Black students attending Harvard would decrease if affirmative action was overturned, though Harvard could gain socioeconomic diversity by scrapping legacy preferences and favoring low-income applicants. But this excuse rings hollow, as we easily could have had both racial and socioeconomic diversity. So today, I grieve the loss of the deeply flawed college that I had come to know and love; this death of diversity is not the change Harvard needed. Today, I grieve the loss of the Harvard that accepted low-income students of color like me; I was the first student from my high school to attend Harvard, and today, I fear I may be the last. Most of all, today I grieve the loss of the Harvard that tore me down, telling me that I did not belong time and time again, only for its communities of color to build me back up, reminding me that low-income brown kids deserve college, too. Today, the Supreme Court has sent an abundantly clear message: College is for the privileged. Joseph W. Hernandez ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Government concentrator in Adams House."
crimson_2023_43,"In a post-affirmative action world, I often find myself questioning my worth as a Harvard student. Did I get in solely because of my race? Am I academically qualified to be here? Did I steal a spot away from another applicant? These questions have often trapped me in a self-perpetuating cycle of self-deprecation, hindering my academic potential. For a while, I believed in the pervasive lie that impostor syndrome imposes on its victims. I often felt not good enough, like Harvard made a mistake in accepting me. But after a few months on campus, I have come to embrace myself in the beautiful mosaic of Harvard freshmen. I, and every other Black freshman, belong here. Individuals who spew anti-affirmative action rhetoric claim that affirmative action is “reverse discrimination,” giving minority students an advantage in the college admissions process. Within this line of thought is the belief that such a non-meritocratic advantage means these students may not be prepared for the rigor of an Ivy League institution. These arguments seek to hinder Black students in predominantly white spaces. By hiding behind the assumption that Black students have lower test scores, on average, than their white counterparts, opponents dream of a merit-based application process — a process that allows only the applicants with the highest scores to be accepted. But merit is inseparable from life experience. Though grades and test scores are a critical part of the admissions process, ignoring the historic and personal difficulties a Black student has had to face effectively disregards parts of their identity — an identity that many feel their application is incomplete without. Systemic oppression means that less privileged individuals often haven’t had access to private tutors and multiple chances to take expensive admissions exams such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. In its 2022 SAT annual report, the College Board reported that students from families earning less than $67,083 annually made up only 22 percent of test takers who reported their family income. The percentage of students taking the SAT from self-reported high-income families — families who make more than $83,766 — was 46 percent. Further, although Black homeowners tend to pay more on average in property taxes than white families, their public schools still receive less funding. Predominantly white districts are typically smaller than minority ones, and, overall, they receive $23 billion more in funding. This disparity in public school funding results from the tendency to draw district lines around affluent communities within larger poorer areas. Thus, the sacrifices some Black students have to make when grappling with marginalization can effectively take a toll on their academic performance. Some Black students have had to put their families’ needs before their own, leading to attendance issues. Others have experienced prejudice within their own communities. And these experiences often have a great impact on Black students’ identities. To emphasize these experiences on their college applications is not harmful. In fact, it is beneficial for the college considering them for admission. Diverse classes allow for different perspectives and ideas to be shared, which leads to students learning from one another. This, in turn, can help to develop critical thinking skills by forcing us to encounter information that challenges our own beliefs. In other words: Black Harvard freshmen, our ideas matter. But we don’t just bring fresh perspectives to this University — we are more than capable of succeeding here. Oneanalysis of graduation ratesat Ivy League institutions reveals that at Harvard, 99 percent of Black undergraduates graduate within a six-year period, compared to 98 percent for undergraduates overall. While this might seem like a minute difference, it is significant in relation to an already high graduation rate. Black students have the experiences, intellect, and determination to succeed at prestigious universities. It is time for us, Black Harvard freshmen, to believe in our prosperity. In the wake of the upcoming 2024 admissions cycle, sans affirmative action, it may be tempting for current Black freshmen to compare ourselves to the incoming freshman class. Because the incoming class could not click a checkbox indicating their race, we may believe that they are more qualified than we are, that their acceptances are more valid than ours. But we have unique experiences and talents to bring to this institution — ideas and abilities that Harvard wants us to continue to explore and flourish. Black Harvard freshmen, you belong here. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Dalevyon L.J. Knight ’27, a Crimson Editorial comper, lives in Canaday Hall."
stanforddaily_2023_34,"Like most students at Stanford, I hadn’t heard of environmental justice before arriving here. I was passionate about ecology and conservation, areas I thought lay clearly separated from social change. But as I learned from frontline communities, professors, classes and clubs, I saw how wrong I was and how inseparable issues of justice were from environmental protection. Justice, and therefore environmental stewardship, spins through everything. But as I have engaged deeper with environmental spaces at Stanford through theEnvironmental Justice Working Group, I have begun to recognize a critical gap in the center of our efforts in sustainability. I’m a scientist, and I’m also a writer and artist. And as I’ve worked with the Doerr School and seen its potential as a space to foster transformative futures, I’ve also seen how much it could benefit from engaging deeper with environmental justice artists and incorporating more of the humanities into its processes and structures. The Doerr Schoolcitesenvironmental justice as one of its key foundations, and art has never been separable from environmental justice. Environmental justice (EJ is a movement that calls attention to disproportionate environmental impacts based on race. Formalized in a set of 17 principles at the1991 First National People of Color Summit, environmental justice has since grown into a movement and respected field of scholarship that spans all levels of power, knowledge and access. At its heart, EJ uplifts the voices and leadership of people of color and marginalized communities. It connects freedom from oppression with healing our relationship with Mother Earth. EJ believes a just future is one where historical injustice against communities of color is healed, and that no sustainability exists apart from that healing. It asserts that all things — whether ecological, human or animal — are fundamentally interconnected. As such, harms enacted on one part, ultimately, ripple outwards to impact everyone. Creating a better world in EJ means paying reparations for violence. It does not allow the segmentation of one issue from another; it recognizes everything touches everything else. For every question, EJ asks who is involved. It recognizes every political as personal. NearlyeverymajorEJmovementhasincludedartandartistsatitsheart. By its nature, art encourages breaking disciplinary rules. It allows us to imagine beyond a constrained set of tools for pre-defined exploration and knowledge generation. It lets usthinkbeyondour current realities.Researchershave recognized art as “the missing anchor” in environmental action. As such, for the scale of our current crises, which requires solutions that envision worlds out of our reach, creating opportunities to engage for art is critical to letting us imagine beyond, past and through. Science scaffolded on centuries of ivory tower knowledge struggles with seeing past that ivory tower. But art can imagine what it would look like to see the tower topple, and can show us what the world could look like, even if we can’t conceptualize it yet ourselves. The Doerr School’s formal engagement with the humanities is still nascent. Classes like Environmental Humanities have begun to offer options to students to explore how sustainability and the humanities interact, but structurally the institution has committed only to the departmentalization of behavior studies and environmental policy. But its opportunity for a radically impactful sustainability effort could be broadened even more if it also institutionalized homes for artists and thinkers to grapple in non-scientific arenas with the biggest problems of our time. EJ offered me the idea that the personal imbues everything with value by illuminating the connections that bind us all. And it pushes me to imagine beyond current realities, past current frameworks, beyond current institutions, towards possibilities where structures of violence and harm do not exist. But I’m realizing that the tools I’ve been given so far through my education in institutionalized science do not lend themselves, by their nature, to that kind of disruption. And I’ve begun to recognize the value of environmental art — not just as a way of translating science for more popular consumption, or of raising awareness about issues already solidified in academic circles, but rather as a way of pushing us forward towards futures and possibilities we can’t see yet. At the Environmental Justice Working Group and places beyond, my teachers, friends, partners and I envision a Doerr School that uplifts the environmental justice humanities to create the revolutionary change necessary for a sustainable planet. The work is already happening. Stanford has incredible environmental justice artists and art spaces that have been flourishing here for years: the annual Earthtones festival, happening again this May, unites radical and beautiful forms of creation from around the Bay Area and beyond. And this year, more and more artists, storytellers and musicians with environmental justice at the heart of their oeuvre have been visiting campus, from the trailblazing Ghanaian musicianOkaidja Afrosoto the Oakland-basedMovement Generation. But these invitations shouldn’t only come because individual departments, labs or students took initiative, or in a once-yearly festival — what if we had concerted residencies in the Doerr School? What if partnerships and fellowships with spaces like Stanford’s Institute for Diversity in the Arts allowed students to devote focused time to exploring the intersections of sustainability and art? What if the Doerr School’s definitions of innovation included technological and scientific advances alongside artistic and ideological boundary-breaking? What would a sustained institutional commitment to that look like? The Doerr School has an extraordinary opportunity to describe all the possibilities a just future offers us. And just like there is no one kind of justice, there is no one kind of imagined future environmental art can offer us. They are as varied and complex and brilliantly radical as the people creating them. Tanvi Dutta Gupta is a senior studying biology on the ecology and evolution track.

crimson_2023_107,"I lost my phone on a solo trip to New York City. It was early January in the Northeast, when frigid temperatures are accompanied by sharp wind and snowflakes that creep up the back of your coat, clinging to your skin. Despite my red nose, chapped-dry lips, and extra pounds of clothing to protect myself from the weather, I was eager to get the full New York experience: the captivating Manhattan skyscrapers, endless traffic jams, and energy-filled crowds speed-walking through the streets. For me, entering a large, modern city is psychologically stimulating. The astonishingly complex, human-built structures and the never-ending hustle culture is to me the epitome of human ambition, of the constant desire to improve our surroundings and ourselves through progressive advancement. Interacting with thousands of people in such quick succession inspires me, and instills confidence within me to chase my dreams. Yet those same concrete streets quickly became engulfing and intimidating the second I checked my pocket and realized that my recently bought iPhone was no longer there. I was quickly overwhelmed by a flood of thoughts: pending emails, unanswered texts, and the sensitive information within my phone. But then I panicked: I realized that not only was I missing the necessary tools to manage my day-to-day life, but also whoever found my device would potentially have access to sensitive data that, if compromised, could devastate my finances. In addition to worrying about my ability to carry out my normal life, I also had to find my way back home. The train system which I was previously able to navigate with ease became a puzzle of colorful, intersecting lines on a physical map, as I attempted to decipher a path to my home without Google Maps. At this moment, I realized that my entire generation has this problem: Growing up with technology, many of us have never had to comprehend the immense size of our cities and their intricate street systems, and have hardly ever experienced the difficulty of navigating without our phones and computers telling us where to go. But even though I had lost my phone, I still had to find a way home, complete my assignments, and submit internship applications. After my initial panic — and a lengthy remorseful contemplation on my failure to purchase phone insurance — I started to develop a deeper connection to my surroundings. As I attempted to find my way back home, I found myself sparking conversations with random New Yorkers, primarily asking for directions, but also learning about their lives. In a world saturated with technology, we often forget the fun of interaction, and the intellectual development that comes from learning about each other. I lacked the comfort of technology, yet I found myself enjoying the challenge of problem-solving and reflecting throughout the journey that accompanied it. The train rides that I once spent staring at my phone screen became adventurous and exciting. Not only did I discover new aspects of the city, such as the captivating world of underground graffiti as I looked out the train window, but I also felt relaxed and at peace. Many of us know that it would be beneficial for us to get off our phones a little bit more. But despite our awareness of the cell phone’s omnipresent role in our lives, we fail to recognize our dependence on them — how incompetent we’d be without them. Oftentimes, Harvard’s academic rigor, as well as our ambitious nature and constant desire to feel productive, makes it easy to spend most of our time connected to technology. We are so focused on attempting to set ourselves up for the future through our academic endeavors that we forget to enjoy the pleasures of our surroundings and the people we spend time with. We fail to explore and appreciate the history embedded within every corner of our campus, and to take advantage of everything we can learn from the incredible range of experiences contained in Harvard’s student body. At Harvard, it often feels like we are supposed to grow up as fast as possible. We spend too much of our time looking forward, never pausing for a moment to learn about the spaces we inhabit, or the people that we share those spaces with. Losing my phone allowed me to forget my ambition and, for a few hours, forced me to immerse myself in the people and the history of a city I love. Although I am still financially recovering from losing my phone, I urge everyone reading this piece to follow two pieces of advice. First, ensure your new devices, and second, lose them once in a while. Steven Giraldo ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Grays Hall."
crimson_2023_170,"What state of being is necessary to get through a semester at Harvard University? Maybe the way to be is self-indulgent career builders with our eyes on the prize. Or perhaps the means to survival till winter break is keeping our nose to the grindstone without drawing too much attention to ourselves. Ultimately, all of us want to know how to cross the finish line with our health and grades intact. I think I found the answer to this question under a bed of dish soap. And it isn’t any of the above. A considerable amount of my vacation time from school is spent in front of the window at home, washing dishes. I feel greatly present when filling one side of the sink with bubbles while queuing up some extraordinary music. Dishwashing reminds me of the myth of Sisyphus. As punishment from the gods, Sisyphus is forced to roll a boulder up a hill just for it to come tumbling back down when it reaches the top. Albert Camus, in his essay “The Myth of Sisyphus,” uses Sisyphus’s tedious existence as a metaphor for our own lives. Sisyphus has no conception of a better day or afterlife. He understands his task — in our case, striving in life — is always unfinished, and this grants him a kind of freedom despite his constraining fate. Camus ends the essay by propositioning us to “imagine Sisyphus happy.” Sisyphus’s boulder rolling is quite similar to how most folks seem to view washing dishes: as a punishment. It’s work, which implies that it’s something you have to do but would not do otherwise. But it would be a mistake to conflate work and punishment. Students too frequently fall into the trap of maligning all work as burdensome and dreary, and it affects our attitude at Harvard. Perceiving every semester as work, something to overcome or accomplish, makes school a drag. Outside of work, we set aside time to play. Unlike work, playing is a free state of being, akin to Miles Davis’s exhilarating jazz trumpet. While people might associate Davis’s virtuosity with the hard work required to master an instrument, his improvisations would be lifeless and incoherent without the mental freedom of a state of play. Our academic lives are similar: To thrive in our educational pursuits is to adopt a state of play. And this requires rejecting the needless distinction between work and play. The best thing we can do is respond to what we are given and make jazz. I realized I wanted to embody this state of being this semester by washing the dishes. If I could turn this burden of adolescence into a tire swing, then I could most certainly make a grueling term at Harvard feel like a symphony. These greasy forks and cereal bowls with cinnamon residue were just metaphors for club meetings and long-winded readings. One of the biggest difficulties in executing this state of being is that it’s pretty contradictory to much of our educational experience. Institutional schooling, like much of modern culture, propagates a rigid separation of work and play. At school, we are to work, and work with rapidity, in order to advance and accomplish. It’s hard to catch us doing things for the sake of doing them — understanding that the point of the dance is the dance. While difficult, it’s possible to do this, given that work and play are such blurred concepts in our lives. Concepts we associate with play can warp into work. Even Rocket League could become as redundant and burdensome as our least favorite chore. But this is a two-way street — the same goes for things we initially perceive as work. On some days, raking the leaves or shoveling the snow might even replace the fun of a swing set by showing us the same natural rhythm the swing possesses. This is the secret to getting through a semester at Harvard. To be present, in the words of Alan W. Watts in his lecture onwork and play, is to “be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now—and instead of calling it work, realize that this is play. Or, in the language of jazz, “It don’t mean a thing, if it ain’t got that swing.” To live a contented semester as a dishwasher is to remind yourself existence is a biological game ready to be played. This is how I imagine Sisyphus happy — by granting that he must perceive rolling the boulder uphill as cosmic gamesmanship. Our biggest mistake is taking our own play too seriously. Prince A.

stanforddaily_2023_43,"During anatomy office hours, a fellow medical school classmate lamented to me, “I know literallynothing.” This was understandable, given the hundreds of body parts we were expected to learn that week. He then proceeded to identify every muscle, tendon, nerve, artery and vein of the cadaver in front of us. Friends warned me of the “Stanford Duck Syndrome” before I arrived at Stanford. For those not familiar with the term, Stanford Student Affairs defines it as “the idea that students are struggling to survive the pressures of a competitive environment while presenting the image of a relaxed student, like a calm duck gliding across a fountain.” Yet on campus, I’ve encountered the opposite. I get the impression that some Stanford students haveeverything together all of the time, while presenting the image of a stressed student. My fellow medical school classmates speak a dialect of self-deprecation that I’m only starting to comprehend. Thus far, I have not heard a single classmate who has said something along the lines of, “I have a solid grasp of the course material.” Am I really to believe one of the best cohorts of medical students in the world doesn’t have a single student who knows the ins and outs of Human Genetics? This cohort includes medical students who earned PhDs in genetics. Throughout my white coat ceremony — medical students’ formal induction into the profession — well-meaning faculty would say things to the effect of, “Everyone will have impostor syndrome at some point. Don’t let it get to you. You deserve to be here.” In some sense, those words sparked inspiration. Here I was, walking amongst future Surgeons General and Nobel Prize winners. Yet at the same time, those words carried equal capacity to trigger feelings of inferiority. If the Rhodes scholar, ex-special forces officer, Science first-author classmate feels impostor syndrome, who am I in comparison? I believe this to be one principal component of impostor syndrome: ourhuman tendency to compare ourselves to others. And when someone you admire says they “literally know nothing,” your own inferiority complex cuts deeper. Although my experiences are grounded in Stanford’s medical school, I believe that this phenomenon permeates the Stanford student experience. I encountered similar attitudes in a lab rotation. In fact, I heard these attitudes way back during my high school days. During a college admissions information session, an audience member asked a Stanford undergraduate, “What makes you special? How did you get in?” The Stanford student replied, “I don’t know. I got lucky.” It didn’t take long before this “lucky” Stanford undergraduate talked about how he co-founded a startup in high school. On the one hand, I am constantly in awe of my colleagues’ and classmates’ humility. Working for the World Health Organization is “just some public health stuff.” But I beg to differ! It is admirable and noble and inspirational. I want to praise my colleagues and classmates, if only they would allow me. When we constantly devalue ourselves in the name of humility, we can’t help but internalize these self-deprecating thoughts (see:illusory truth effect . Anything said with enough repetition may turn into our internal truth. And I would hope for my classmates’ truth to be something other than, “I know literally nothing.” Importantly, when we devalue ourselves, we are not only mentally but physically vulnerable. I don’t endorsetoxic positivityor insufferable confidence—yet surely, the converse is equallyunhealthy. No singular conversation will fix such deeply rooted problems. But we can build each others’ and our own self-worth in seemingly insignificant, genuine interactions. During anatomy office hours, instead of professing, “I know literally nothing,” we can instead choose to say, “I can identify the muscles. However, I don’t quite know where the anatomical landmarks are. What about you?” The former can easily alienate a classmate who truly does not know the course material, whereas the latter encourages a helpful and genuine discourse. Honesty may not always be the best policy, but it sure helps. These interactions invite dialogue on our talents—and our true weaknesses. They make us better teammates. They humanize us. Stanford has long fought against the practice of unhealthy “Stanford Duck Syndrome.” I ask that we have an open conversation about this cultural counter-phenomenon, where students are no longer displaying humility but humiliating themselves. Psychological phenomena like the illusory truth effect can harm us; they can also improve our mental well-being if used correctly. In lieu of reinforcing the idea of “I know literally nothing,” instead show confidence in what you do know. Physiological benefits aside,higher self-esteem can lead to better social relationships! So let’s aim high. Use that energy where it matters most, such as in times we should practicecultural humility, not in times we feel the need to crack a self-humiliating joke. We should be humble and confident. We can strive to be remarkable and human. Steven Truong is an MD-PhD student in Stanford’s Medical Scientist Training Program. He is from Minneapolis, Minnesota.

crimson_2023_34,"We need to start talking more about our periods. I can still vividly remember my trip to the drugstore to buy my first box of tampons. Barely understanding what I was doing because my mother had told me tampons shouldn’t be used until marriage (I wish I were kidding , I hurriedly walked to the checkout line, concealing the small, colorful box under my coat. A flash of panic overcame me as I realized that the cashier was a middle-aged man who would soon know the horribly embarrassing fact that I was on my period. Face down, avoiding eye contact, I quickly made my purchase and practically ran out of the store. Perhaps not everyone has felt the same way I did, though I doubt my experience is unique. The stigma and social taboos associated with menstruation have long been ingrained into many of us. Subliminal messaging through popular media and societal norms has contributed significantly to this, creating a culture in which nearly half of the population is made to feel embarrassed simply because they have or will bleed. Consider the common comedic trope of menstrual humor used in movies. In the 2005 film “Dirty Love,” Jenny McCarthy’s character starts bleeding heavily in a drugstore, in a scene apparently intended to invoke disgust. The cult classic “Mean Girls,” too, delivers a punchline involving “super-jumbo tampons” and “heavy flow.” While some might interpret these only as harmless jokes, the clear implication is that our periods are something so awkward they need to be laughed at. For years, pad commercials have featured blue dye to represent menstrual blood, seemingly to mitigate the risk of offending the general public with more realistic red dye. This, too, implies that this normal physiologic process requires censorship and discretion. A large part of what drove me to become a gynecologist was my determination to normalize the dialogue around reproductive and menstrual health. Our society’s problem with talking about periods isn’t just an affront to social justice — it’s also potentially dangerous. Our periods are often a reflection of our overall state of health. From my experiences with both patients and peers, I have come to see that poor health literacy surrounding menstruation is a common issue spanning different cultures and age groups. Without engaging in discourse with others about our bodies, it can often be difficult to parse out what is considered ‘normal.’ There are some who experience debilitatingly painful periods, needing to take days off of work or school each month. Meanwhile, some stop having periods altogether before the expected age of menopause, unaware that they need to seek medical help. And then there are some who bleed so heavily each month that they become anemic, not realizing the severity of their condition until they present with a critically low blood count. By normalizing conversations around periods, we can help reduce the number of those who suffer in silence. When it comes to menstrual justice, students at Harvard are among the lucky ones. Free tampons and menstrual pads are provided in restrooms all across campus, and Harvard University Health Services provides widespread coverage for gynecologic and reproductive health services. In considering the importance of this issue, we should acknowledge our positions of privilege compared to many others. The time has come to lift the curtain on menstruation. We just need to talk about it. Period. Angela Li is a graduate of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health."
state_press_2023_18,"College is already expensive as is, so when the program adds additional expenses for equipment needed to be in the major, students are less inclined to study nursing. Nursing students at ASU have to pay large amounts of money on out-of-pocket expenses for equipment and travel required for the major. This limits access to the program and hinders students’ ability to go into a field that is in high demand. Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovationassociate dean Katherine Kenny and senior director for recruitment and student success Nancy Kiernan said in an email that ASU nursing students are required to pay for scrubs, stethoscopes and specialized shoes. An officially licensed location to purchase this equipment is Apparel Pro. Nursing students said they are required to use ASU-branded nursing gear, and Apparel Pro is one of the more common locations students use to purchase this equipment. According to theApparel Pro website, the ASU dress code reads, “Students are required to purchase all uniform items with the ASU CONHI insignia through the approved vendor. These items include: wine scrub jacket, wine scrub shirt, white polo shirt.” Alison Berg, a sophomore nursing student at ASU, said the added expenses create a “stressful environment.” “I feel like it should be provided, in a way, because we’re trying to do our clinicals and work and everything like that just to get our education,” Berg said. There are also other expenses, such asCastlebranchregistration ($163 , NCLEX test registration fee ($200 , ATI testing (ranging from $400-600 , textbooks, a drug and alcohol screening ($80 , a criminal background clearance ($74 ,My Clinical Exchangefees ($40 and other ASU fees. ATI testing, a nursing learning tool, costs an estimated $400 per semester for traditional nursing students but can cost upwards of $600. Stethoscopes, uniforms, shoes and skills bags cost an estimated $600 to $800. On top of those necessities, nursing students also have to find a way to go to and from the hospitals they are assigned to for clinicals which are hands-on hospital work required for graduation. READ MORE:Nursing students face challenges to find transportation to required clinical experiences “A lot of people do struggle with transportation, because it’s all just on your own,” said Kyle Beer, a sophomore studying nursing. Nursing students fill out a form before clinicals start to name location preferences, but Beer said students can still be placed far from their preferences. All of these obstacles create boundaries to accessibility for before and during the program. College is already expensive as is, so when the program adds additional expenses for equipment needed to be in the major, students are less inclined to study nursing. “Nursing education is highly sought after, which leads to a very competitive application process,” said Hadaad Dine, a sophomore nursing student in the accelerated program. “So, if somebody is worried about financial aid… they might just completely decide not to go into that field.” There are things that nursing students said ASU could do to make the nursing program more accessible. Outside of having the various expenses paid for, they suggested implementing a program where nursing students could donate equipment that could then be rented out to other students at a cheaper price. “I feel like they could have a hand-me-down program,” Berg said. Theaccelerated programalso provides a reimbursement for transportation and required equipment for students, but the regular nursing program does not. “We need to pay now, to purchase the items ahead of time, but once they verify financial aid, they’ll give us a reimbursement of those scrubs, textbooks and all the stuff,” Dine said. Given that there’s ashortageof nurses in the U.S. following COVID-19 burnout, it’s wrong that so many obstacles are placed in the way of becoming a nurse. “In a time where everybody’s saying there’s a nursing shortage and we need more nurses, and even the nursing program itself wants to get as many people as they can, you’re making it a little tough for a lot of people to do that,” Beer said. The statement provided by Kenny and Kiernan said, Students are encouraged to file aFAFSAand work withASU Financial Aid and Scholarship Servicesregarding financial aid. ASU should cover the added expenses that nursing students need to pay, and it should introduce measures to make the nursing school more affordable until all expenses can be covered.

crimson_2023_127,"I graduated cum laude from Harvard College in 2022, and right now, I’m working as a paralegal in Manhattan, getting ready to apply to law schools this fall. But there’s a catch. I’m “stateless,” which means no country will offer me citizenship. Right now, there’s abill in Congress— the Stateless Protection Act — that could fix my legal situation and offer people like me a path to adjust our status. But until then, I’m ineligible for federal student loans, and there’s a real chance I won’t be able to afford to become a lawyer. I’m a patriot. Yet my situation strikes me as decidedly un-American. I know America can do better to uphold our stated values. Currently, it’s failing stateless people like me. Statelessness is a crucial human rights issue. At Harvard, I read lots of constitutional law, and my lack of citizenship seems exactly the kind of cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. It also contravenes Article 15 of the 1948Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which declares the right to a nationality. Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren once referred to denationalization as “the total destruction of the individual’s status in organized society” and “a form of punishment more primitive than torture.” Why? Because it crushes an individual’s “political existence that was centuries in the development.” Warren was right; statelessness has indeed destroyed many people’s lives. It can make us feel unable to control our own futures and instead bound to a system we cannot change. It takes our voice away from politics. It affects our autonomy and sense of belonging. It separates families, tears individuals from their childhood homes, and forbids them from growing roots in this country. About 200,000 Americans are affected by statelessness, all with our own stories and histories. In my case, it means I can’t leave the country because I don’t have a passport. I was born in Greece, but the country does not have birthright citizenship. My family ended up moving to the United States, settling in Waterbury, Conn. As a high schooler, I drew inspiration from American democracy, always knocking on my neighbors’ doors around election time. Even though I couldn’t vote for the candidates myself, I’ve always loved public service. But there aren’t many people with my background in elected office in America. In Alaska, Senators Lisa A. Murkowski (R-Alaska and Dan S. Sullivan ’87 (R-Alaska recentlysecured the passage of a private billto naturalize one stateless woman, Rebecca Trimble. I applaud their efforts. But it’s an inefficient use of government resources to pass federal legislation one person at a time, when we could implement a universal solution quickly. All we’d have to do is act. Two members of Congress, Senator Ben L. Cardin (D-Md. and Representative Jamie B. Raskin ’83 (D-Md. , have introduced a promising bill in Congress. TheStateless Protection Act of 2022would create a new protected status and pathway to citizenship for people like me. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has also made some promises. In December of 2021, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would “adopt a definition of statelessness for immigration purposes and enhance protections for stateless individuals living in the United States.” Four months later, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas reiterated this promise during atelevision interview, claiming that the department would realize its commitment by the end of the fiscal year. Sadly, that fiscal year has since concluded with the administration’s promise having yet to materialize. Stateless people continue to live in utter legal confusion. Statelessness is impossible to fully grasp if you don’t know somebody, in person, experiencing statelessness. This makes it crucial for stateless people to raise awareness of our status. I joined a new organization called United Stateless, led by people similarly in my legal situation. We’re speaking out to call attention and convince people that this issue is urgent. It takes courage for us to speak up. When I was growing up, my family discouraged me from talking about my statelessness. I worried about how my peers might perceive me. Then, when I finally broke the ice in high school, it became something I wanted to talk about more often. Statelessness has gone on in the quiet for too long, and its stigma has led to the exploitation of countless stateless people. But when I tell my story, people in similar circumstances often approach me and tell me how encouraged they were by hearing it. The more we connect with each other, the more we realize there is power in talking. And I don’t just talk about my own story. I try to tell people about the challenges faced by other stateless people here in America. One of my colleagues at United Stateless, Ekaterina, has been trying to get her very ill mother into the country for years. My friend Henry is a Holocaust survivor in his eighties who hasspent his life anxiousbecause of his statelessness. Customs agents took my friend Danahto a detention facility and strip-searched her at age 15. My friend Kevin married a stateless woman and, a decade later,she remains unable to obtain citizenship. Statelessness tries as hard as it can to keep us from living productive lives. Please raise the issue of statelessness with a colleague or friend. The more of us know and understand the issue, the quicker we can resolve things for everyone. It’s past time to help people in my situation out. Daiana Lilo ’22 is a graduate of Cabot House and a member of United Stateless."

stanforddaily_2023_14,"In January, trauma researcher and Stanford alum Dr. Jennifer Freyd, a co-author on this article, gave an invited presentation to a meeting of the Kiwanis Club of Palo Alto. The presentation focused on the ways institutions respond to sexual violence and how these responses often do more harm than good — particularly when victims experience betrayal from their institutions. At the end of the presentation, an older man and Kiwanis Club member approached Dr. Freyd with a question: “Why does Stanford keep messing up?” Dr. Freyd hadn’t mentioned Stanford’s response to sexual violence in her presentation. She had provided some examples of times when other universities failed to adequately address sexual harassment and assault, but Stanford was not among them. Still, the audience member wanted to know why Stanford seemed to have trouble dealing with sexual assault on its campus. In this man’s view, why couldn’t this powerful university — presumably equipped with a rich supply of resources — get it right? The audience member’s question reflects long-held concerns about the way Stanford has handled campus sexual assault. For years, students, advocates and faculty have called attention to the University’s lack of meaningfultransparencyandactionsurrounding sexual assault cases. Individuals reporting unwanted sexual contact to Stanford have experienced afrustratingly opaque and confusinginvestigation process with outcomes that can fall short of meeting victims’ needs. Faced with potentiallyretraumatizinginvestigative proceedings, many students choose not to report to the university at all. Findings from the2015 Stanford Campus Climate Surveyrevealed only 2.7% of students who had experienced nonconsensual sexual contact reported the assault to the University. Amore recent surveyconducted by Stanford in 2019 found that fewer than 5% of all students who experienced any kind of gender-based victimization — including intimate partner violence, stalking, and sexual contact — made a report to the Stanford Title IX office. But Stanford has more than just a reporting problem. Actions (and lack thereof by the university’s administration have left some questioning Stanford’s priorities. Citing low numbers of students expelled for committing sexual violence, protesters haveurgedStanford to remove student perpetrators from campus to better protect victims and prevent further violence. Stanford has been similarlycriticizedfor failing to take disciplinary action against faculty who have committed sexual misconduct. It’s cases like these that have led some members of the Stanford community to believe that the University intentionally shields perpetrators. Sofia Scarlat, a student who was sexually assaulted during her freshman year in 2021,declaredin that “Stanford would rather protect the University’s image, the reputation of rapists at the expense of the well-being and survival of victims of sexual assault.” Adding to a list of “self-inflicted wounds,” Stanfordunceremoniously dismissedone of its Title IX lawyers — the sole lawyer who exclusively represented victims — in 2017 after she spoke to The New York Times about Stanford’s “complex” and time-consuming process for investigating sexual assaults. Stanford claimed the lawyer was dropped because she demonstrated a “lack of faith” in the University’s Title IX reporting process, creating the appearance of intolerance of criticism on this issue. Stanford’s series of damaging missteps surrounding sexual assault constitute what is known by researchers asinstitutional betrayal. Institutional betrayal happens when institutions engage in wrongdoing — intentionally or not — that puts the safety and wellbeing of their community members at risk. This can look like implementing harmful or unjust policies, failing to protect people from harm within the institution, or responding insufficiently when harm does occur. Research suggests that institutional betrayal adds an additional layer of harm to campus sexual victimization. Students who experience institutional betrayal from their university following unwanted sexual contactreportelevated levels of anxiety, dissociation, and other trauma symptoms compared to their peers who do not experience institutional betrayal. In other words, being subjected to institutional betrayal is associated with even worse psychological outcomes for victims — a painful twist of the knife in the wound left by sexual violence. At Stanford, some victims appear to be all-too familiar with this betrayal. In hermemoirdetailing her rape by a Stanford student in 2015, Chanel Miller referenced institutional betrayal and its harms during a discussion of Stanford’s unapologetic response to her victim statement. This case garnered tremendous media attention, giving Stanford theopportunity to reflect upon and ameliorateits way of responding to campus sexual assault — has Stanford improved how it responds since then? In 2022, Sofia Scarlat’s op-ed called out Stanford for engaging ininstitutional betrayaland shared her “outrage for how this institution has betrayed survivors.” Even many non-victims on the Stanford campus anticipate betrayal from the university in recent years. The2019 campus climate surveydiscovered that fewer than 30% of undergraduate women believed campus officials would “conduct a fair investigation” if someone were to report sexual misconduct. But institutional betrayal can be remedied by engaging ininstitutional courage. When institutions make a commitment to “accountability, transparency, actively seeking justice, and making reparations where needed,” they reduce the likelihood of harming the people who depend on them. There are a number ofspecific actionsinstitutions can take to practice institutional courage, including responding sensitively to victim disclosures, apologizing for harms experienced within the institution, and committing resources to preventative and restorative measures. Institutional courage is not necessarily an easy task — it asks institutions to assume some level of potentially unpleasant exposure, risk, and costs. But the price of not practicing institutional courage is often much higher. Arecent studyfrom our team investigating institutional courage in the workplace suggests it plays a beneficial role, with results indicating that institutional courage was related to higher job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Institutional courage was also found to buffer against negative outcomes associated with institutional betrayal. The conclusion? Institutional courage seemed to be beneficial for both institutions and their members. Preliminary research from our team using a similar methodology with undergraduate students found similar results — that institutional courage can help protect victims and boost institutional trust and engagement in the context of campus sexual violence. Institutional courage offers Stanford a clear path forward to stop “messing up” its handling of sexual assault cases. It would not be the easiest task for the university to take on — justice typically does not comport with ease and comfort, after all — and this is why the word “courage” is used here — but it is certainly needed at a time when members of the Stanford community experience harm and betrayal. Stanford can do right by victims. It just needs some courage. “Without courage, you cannot practice any other virtue consistently. You can be kind for a while; you can be generous for a while; you can be just for a while, or merciful for a while, even loving for a while. But it is only with courage that you can be persistently and insistently kind and generous and fair.”– Maya Angelou"
newuniversity_california_irvine_2023_0,"Editor’s Note: This article contains content and information surrounding suicide and mental health. ASTRO memberMoonbinpassed away unexpectedly at the young age of 25 on April 19, 2023. Shortly after, his company, Fantagio Entertainment,tweeted“Moonbin suddenly left us and has now become a star in the sky.” According to initial policereports, Moonbin appeared to have taken his life. Unfortunately, the suicides of K-pop superstars are a common and unsurprising occurrence. Moonbin’s death encourages the public to more closely examine how the K-pop industry treats its idols and the extent to which the industry’s work environment encourages poor mental health. The extreme stress that idols deal with throughout their careers isheavily documented, but often not addressed in earnest or scrutinized enough for its potential consequences on their health. You don’t have to look deep to see the environmental factors that contribute to mental health issues in the K-pop industry. Moonbin is only one of many idols who have passed on too soon. Fans were shocked by the death of SHINee idolKim JonghyuninDecember of 2017. At the time, SHINee was one of the most successful boy groups, withchart-topping songslike “Ring Ding Dong,” “Lucifer” and “Sherlock.” However, the fear ofliving up to rising expectationsafter the success of his first solo album took a major toll on his mental health. After his passing, Jonghyun’s heart-wrenchingsuicide letterrevealed that he never felt good enough for his company or fans. In the end, he simply asked that fans “just tell him he did well.” Jonghyun’s passing also highlighted a lack of support from his agency. Short hiatuses did nothing to improve his mental health. He and many other idols, such asSulli,Goo Hara,Ahn So Jinand unfortunately many more, needed mental health help and support that their companies failed to provide. The attacks on idols’ appearances are the strongest. Many idolsdebut young, facing constant criticism for their appearances and performances before they even step on stage. To maintain thin appearances, idols haveused extreme methodsto lose weight and are subjected to regular, sometimes daily,weigh-ins. Former idol Kyla Massie of the now-disbanded girl group Pristin debuted at a weight that fans deemed “unacceptable.” Most companiesencouragefemale idols to achieve specific beauty standards, especially maintaining a weight of around90 pounds. Kyla’s profile, however, displayed132 pounds, a perfectlyhealthy weightfor a 5’5” girl. Yet, Korean fansrefused to acknowledgeKyla or cheer for her when she was at the center of performances. Duringfanmeets, attendees refused to photograph or even look at Kyla. She was just 16 at the time of her debut and soon went on ahiatusthat never ended. The expectation of sheer perfection is impossible for idols to live up to, yet that doesn’t stop companies from demanding it. In addition to handling public scrutiny, idols are expected to perform and produce content at an unhealthy rate without rest. Agencies setvigorous schedulesfor their idols, who constantly pump out new content in hopes of debuting as the next megastars. Throughout the year, successful idols release multiple albums and singles to maintain the attention of fans and hopefully gain more. Even during the pandemic year of 2020,BTSreleased multiple albums, held virtual concerts, spoke at the UN and constantly filmed content like “BTS Memories of 2020,” which included722 hoursof behind-the-scenes content for their fans. In their documentaries, BTS has included scenes where they have performed while injured or sick. Clips show the men using IV drips andrespiratorsin order to overcome physical exhaustion during their concerts. The extreme lengths to which idols resort tocontinue performingwhile injured should be concerning. Idols deal with high levels of mental and physical stress as well as constant criticism from their management. Yet they receive little to no support from their companies. With this kind of work environment, it shouldn’t be a shock that the work of our beloved idols takes such a large toll on their minds and bodies. In light of Moonbin’s passing, Korean entertainment companies need to be held accountable for the well-being of their talent. It should be mandatory for entertainment companies to monitor the health of their talent, provide proper and extensive mental health resources and allow for proper rest. Until then, fans can still take action. Boycott companies that mistreat their idols until the tides change. By purchasing albums and merchandise, we are funding the exploitation of idols. Furthermore, fans need to stop praising idols for only their appearance because this response produces an expectation for idols to maintain unrealistic beauty standards. Let’s stop turning a blind eye to the not-so-secret suffering behind the scenes of our favorite K-pop artists. Asia Boyd is a Campus News Staff Writer. She can be reached atasiajb@uci.edu."
crimson_2023_63,"This op-ed is part of a special opinion package, “Antisemitism at Harvard, According to Seven Jewish Affiliates.”View the full package here. When I, Eric, got home for winter break, my grandfather embraced me with teary eyes and shaky arms. “I’m happy you made it back alright given all of the antisemitism over there,” he said. I was shocked by his words. When my grandfather was growing up in Iran, he was beaten in the street for being Jewish. I assumed the physical antisemitism he experienced during his youth would have served to reduce his fears around news of antisemitism at Harvard. Instead, his fears reached the point of tears. I hugged him tight and assured him that he did not need to worry about physical threats against me as a Jewish student at Harvard. I was telling my grandfather the truth. I — and Isaac — believe physical harassment has not been the primary manifestation of contemporary antisemitism on college campuses: This is not to say that physical attacks on Jewish students never happen, nor is it meant to diminish the rising physical manifestations of broader extremism. At Harvard, a Jewish first-year student told us he was aggressively questioned for wearing a kippah and asked if he did so out of support for Israel. Similarly, a graduate student wasfollowed and harassedfor wearing a keffiyeh. Even though we feel largely physically safe, we have noticed a disturbing, reductionist narrative at Harvard and beyond, which unilaterally invalidates the Jewish experience. We have witnessed the denial of genuine instances of antisemitism, paired with the subsequent invalidation of Jewish reactions and even emotions. This silencing is something that no group, least of all a historically marginalized group, should have to face. From the moment the world learned of the carnage of Oct. 7 attacks, there has been a deluge of disinformation downplaying the horror of the day. False coverage of the day has fueled skepticism and emboldened voices downplaying the horror of Hamas’ brutality. Rape denial has been especially rampant, despitemultiplenewsoutletsreporting evidence that sexual assault indeed occurred that day. We have watched the erasure of the violence of Oct. 7 and tacit suppression of Jewish grief unfold firsthand. One of our peers shared anInstagram postthat claims Israel lied about the killing of “Israeli settler babies” and asserts that witnesses’ claims of rape were “unsubstantiated.” While we understand that we can’t force everyone to feel sympathy, blatant attempts to deny the experiences of those suffering should have no place on this campus. Diminishing the unquestionable evil of Oct. 7 gives way to tacit defense of Hamas’ actions and, in turn, serves no one but Hamas and nothing but terror. It was deeply disappointing to see that several students felt compelled to do exactly this on social media and in dialogue. Such dehumanization often affects Palestinians as well. In the national discourse, we have witnessed many decry the entire population of Gaza as Hamas terrorists, fail to express empathy for suffering civilians, and argue that Palestinians somehow “had it coming” for electing Hamas more than 15 years ago. Just as such rhetoric constitutes anti-Palestinian racism, the dehumanization of Israelis is antisemitic. Additionally, the very format of the package of op-eds to which this article belongs begs our examination. I, Isaac, am a proud member of the Editorial Board. When it comes to the Board’s track record of tackling bigotry, their first reaction tends to be exactly that – tackling said bigotry. Regarding antisemitism, their response has deviated significantly from the norm. They have decided to gather a wide range of perspectives from various corners of the Jewish community, taking a far more skeptical approach than we believe the issue merits. We cannot find a similar treatment — with multiple authors dissecting exactly what constitutes hate — for any other form of hate in The Crimson in recent history, indicating that the conversation surrounding antisemitism has become much more equivocal than it ought to be. Moreover, there has been a broader, equally disturbing dialogue attempting to dictate the bounds of Jewish feelings. Whenever University President Claudine Gay takes a step to reckon with antisemitism on campus, students turn to social media to deny the presence of said antisemitism. Similarly, when President Gaycondemned the chant“from the river to the sea” — a phrase many Jewish students find hurtful due to its historical connotations — students were quick to push back without taking seriously that a large contingent of the student body is hurt by that specific choice of language. Additionally, consider those who defended her congressional testimony that repeatedly failed to categorize calls for genocide against Jews as a violation of Harvard’s code of conduct on bullying and harrassment. Social media posts dismissing Jewish students’ concerns with controversial chants have left Jewish students who are made uncomfortable by the phrase feeling hysterical. Regardless of the intention behind the chants, Jewish students have the right to feel uncomfortable, but our peers deny this right when they attempt to redefine what we are allowed to feel. The consistent and strident pushback against action that could help Jewish students coupled with the defense of actions that could hurt us carries the implicit accusation that our concerns are illegitimate and our fears are unfounded. Efforts to restrict the grief of Jewish students have, again, reached the pages of this very publication. In aCrimson op-ed titled “In Defense of the Truth,”the author writes “when I hear statements like ‘these are the hardest days in the history of the Jewish people,’ I am obliged to respond that they are not.” Such a claim is absolutely unacceptable, as it implies that it is wrong for Jews to express our emotions in the wake of the largest massacre of our people in recent history. On Oct. 7, over 1,000 Jews were murdered in a land meant to be a safe haven for them, shattering the collective sense of Israeli and Jewish security in just a day. We are not blind to the fact that charges of antisemitism have been politicized and weaponized to silence criticism of Israel — including silencing calls for a ceasefire. However, it has been truly disheartening to see that amidst the heightened tensions on our own campus, some of our peers have neglected to extend to Jewish and Israeli students the compassion, understanding, and humanity that we all deserve.

rice_thresher_2023_3,"ByRiley Barker1/17/23 11:45pm Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. Last week, I quit my role as Student Association director of elections because I need to take more time for music and academia this semester, but there are two additional reasons I left the position relevant to campus politics that I want to share. First: the Thresher Editorial Board is the most vocal critic of the Student Association, and I did not want to battle tabloidism through March. The Board has published11 editorialssince 2017 criticizing or complaining about the SA. Last year, the Board opted for a curt, holier-than-thou message to the entire Rice undergraduate population: “Vote. It’s not that hard.” The Board will hide behind positive SA coverage, press privilege and good intentions, but by publishing backhanded, sardonic jabs which dramatize Student Association news without seriously considering what publicly undermining their peer Blanket Tax organization will accomplish, the Board ends up further pushing Rice students away from the ballot each year, delegitimizing the very institution it claims to support. The Thresher is a fantastic student-run newspaper, but the Board’s implicit claim that they keep the flame of campus democracy alive is hypocritical. Second: I left because I felt that, though there have been many successful, virtuous projectscompletedby past student Senates, the current approach of the legislative body lends itself generously to stagnation. Between executive board dawdling, Thresher election sensationalism, the naturally narrow scope of SA committees and the rarity of ballot initiatives (which would otherwise enable all Rice undergraduates to vote on important campus matters , SA has acquired a reputation as generally apathetic. Additionally, strict proceduralism keeps Senate structure as rigid and slow-moving as national government. In their current form, the SA’s rules of decorum and various regulations have become, as Kafka wrote of in “Before the Law,” gatekeepers of swift or sweeping action. The Rice undergraduate community is neither properly self-governing nor fully engaged because SA proceedings lack experimentation and flexibility. Leadership has expressed no public interest in reimagining SA’s perception problem or fixing internal structure. Despite my own criticisms, I believe the Student Association is vital to Rice campus. Rice students pay an$85“union due” each year to SA and other student-run organizations, which means undergraduates have a real financial incentive to vote in SA elections. However, most Rice students are unaware of the tax and view elections as largely inconsequential. Low-participation will not suddenly shift because of a few condescending Thresher editorials or anextended campaign period. However, as I wrote last March, there is a solution: SA should implementuniversal votingand prioritize frequent referenda/initiative elections on driving issues instead of shifting the responsibility of action onto an SA legislative process, which takes anywhere from months to years to carry out. I tried to move this idea forward as director of elections, then independently through a ballot initiative, but was stonewalled at every turn. Ultimately, we can generate interest in SA, expand non-elected engagement and make our only self-governing, student-run institution far more democratic and egalitarian, but we must be one, united student body in this effort. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

ubyssey_2023_3,"Nov. 24, 2023 Written byChaimae Chouiekh Chaimae Chouiekh (she/her is a Moroccan first-year Master of Journalism student with a background in finance, mathematics and communication. She aspires to pursue a career as an international reporter, focusing on topics related to community, politics, race and social justice. Her work reflects a dedication to amplifying underrepresented voices. Navigating life as an international student can be quite a challenge. One moment, you are cocooned in the warmth of familiar faces in a place you call “home,” and the next, you find yourself propelled into a foreign country. You spend your time figuring out currency conversions or struggling to find the right words in your second or third language. But most importantly, you continuously try to build a bridge between your new life and the one you left behind. Many like myself, who hail from Morocco, keep juggling our schedules around precious calls with loved ones stay up to date with news. It’s comforting to believe that everything remains peaceful in our absence. However, the tranquillity I have experienced since coming to Canada was unexpectedly shattered one late night with a single Al Jazeera English push notification: “Breaking News: over 2,000 dead as powerful earthquake hits Morocco near Marrakesh.” It left me in a state of turmoil and hopelessness as I checked-in with my relatives and lived through their distress and fear while being unable to provide any tangible assistance. On September 8, the Kingdom of Morocco was violently hit by an unprecedented6.8-magnitude earthquake. This disaster was the most devastating in Morocco’s recent history,killing more than 2,900 people, injuring 5,500 people and plunging the country into chaos. As this heartbreaking news dominated international headlines, it was quite surprising and disheartening to see no mention of this international catastrophe in UBC’s official statements or communication channels the next morning. Life at UBC seemed to follow its course while mine was flipped upside down. Here I was supposed to pretend that everything was fine when, on the other side of the planet, my community was in mourning. The absence of a formal acknowledgment from the university highlighted just how essential such official statements are, especially during times of crisis. Official statements function as a beacon of reassurance, providing assistance and a collective voice of empathy for those directly affected. Moreover, these statements serve not only to offer support but also to acknowledge the pain and challenges faced by affected communities, validating their experiences. By reliably issuing these statements, the university ensures that all members, especially those in crisis, feel seen, heard and cared for. The latter is only true if these statements are released uniformly and consistently across the various crises unfolding around the globe. In times of crisis, the absence of an official statement expressing sympathy and solidarity will undeniably evoke a profound sense of isolation and a feeling of being “overlooked.” UBC’s vocalness on certain crises and its silence over others show signs of selective solidarity, making me question the motives behind such statements. Is it the gravity of the situation? The space it takes in the mediatic sphere? Or maybe the density of the UBC community affected by these tragedies? Drawing upon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assertion that “there is power in numbers,” one might observe that UBC’s silence on this matter indicates a perception that if a demographic isn’t sizable, its concerns may not be granted recognition. To illustrate, following the recent case of the Indian-Canadian geopolitical conflicts,UBC promptly acknowledged and addressed the potential anxiety and stress affecting the community. While such an initiative is very needed and helpful to the affected community, one might speculate that UBC’s prompt response could have been influenced by the substantial Indian student population. This responsiveness can be seen as a testament to the university’s commitment to its diverse population when the numbers are indeed substantial. It may also reflect an understanding that the well-being of a large demographic has a profound impact on the broader university community, reinforcing the notion that there is indeed strength — and therefore attention afforded — in numbers. Observing other Canadian universities acknowledging the earthquake and expressing solidarity with Morocco created a stark contrast in my mind. For instance, on September 12, the University of Toronto released a “Message to the University Community on the Earthquake in Morocco and Flooding in Libya” assuring that“The University will continue to monitor both situations and provide updates as needed.” The University of Dalhousie was also “reaching out directly to their students from Morocco and Libya.” The issue extends beyond the mere content of these statements; it’s about the acknowledgment and unity demonstrated by peer academic institutions that UBC failed to embody during a critical situation. Almost one week after the “Al Haouz” Moroccan earthquake, Islamic Relief UBC emerged as a beacon of compassion on campus. They took the proactive initiative to organize a Krispy Kreme fundraiser featuring donuts with proceeds earmarked for the Moroccan cause. This heartfelt effort was swiftly followed by another fundraiser, which took place during the Muslim Student Association’s welcome-back social event on September 15. The funds raised during this event were destined for the International Development and Relief Foundation (IDRF , a trusted organization with strong ties to both international relief efforts and the Moroccan community. These events marked the first occasion since the onset of the earthquake where a moment of silence and direct prayers were held on campus for all the Moroccan families who had lost everything in the disaster. It was the first time I felt not only heard and represented but also deeply touched by the empathy of those around me at UBC. Despite being the only Moroccan in the room, I found solace in that shared compassion. This particular initiative underscores two observations. First, it is often those who share similar backgrounds, experiences or beliefs who are more inclined to empathize with one’s suffering. In this case, it seemed that the Muslim community, perhaps drawing from shared cultural or religious ties, was more attuned to the urgency and significance of the Moroccan cause. Second, it’s worth noting that the university itself appeared to abdicate its responsibility in responding to this humanitarian crisis. Instead, students came together to fill the gaps left by the institution, demonstrating the powerful need for fundraising and solidarity events on campus. This serves as a powerful reminder of the impact that collective student action can have on addressing pressing issues when the official channels fall short. The latter should be unacceptable to an institution branding itself as an “inclusive intercultural space” with international students at the centre of its DNA. When the university neglects to extend condolences to any community, it leaves individuals grappling with a sense of being alone in their concerns. It’s more than just a matter of words on paper; it’s about the reassurance that, even in a foreign land, there is recognition and support for the emotional weight carried by those connected to the affected area. One cannot claim to be a global institution while being selective about its solidarity and choosing which tragedies are worth public acknowledgment. On the contrary, the UBC community should stand united against any tragedy. The act of acknowledging the pain and uncertainty that community members may be experiencing is not just a formality; it’s a crucial step in fostering a sense of belonging and solidarity during challenging times. UBC’s ongoing silence on international matters risks perpetuating feelings of exclusion and unmet expectations, leaving students and staff to navigate their distress without the support of the institution they so desperately want to call home. But what is home if it shuts the door on you when you need it the most? Unfortunately, this pattern of selective solidarity extends beyond the Moroccan earthquake. UBC has also refrained from making official remarks about other significant global events, such as the Afghanistan earthquake, Libyan floods or pro-Palestine protests happening on campus. The fact that these communities are not considerable in terms of number on campus again suggests a correlation between the university’s response and the size of the respective international communities within the campus body. This is a call not just for acknowledging specific incidents but for a more comprehensive and empathetic approach toward the global events that touch the lives of the UBC community. Recognizing the interconnectedness of our world and standing in solidarity during moments of crisis is not just a fancy word to put on a university website; it is a crucial element of fostering an inclusive and supportive campus environment. Inclusive representation is not only about cultural diversity on campus but also about acknowledging and empathizing with the trials that affect different communities. UBC, with all its resources, must do better at refining its communication approach to handling international crises. It stands to reason that the only path forward is for UBC to shoulder the responsibility for all its students and staff, embracing an empathetic stance as an educational pillar. If such a powerful entity fails to recognize and address the pain within its community, one must wonder — who else will? This is an opinion letter.

ubyssey_2023_31,"March 22, 2023 Written byShanai Tanwar Since you’re reading this, I’m going to assume that you, at least to some degree, identify as a romantic. Be it watchingThe Notebookas a guilty pleasure or secretly wishing for someone to serenade you on Main Mall, there’s something in you that just loves the idea of love. The problem for romantics like us is that we are often labelled cliché. Rightfully so, too — when you’re in love, everything feels like it’s out of a fairytale, every moment is a tableau and every word is poetry. But I’ve come to think that maybe the pointisthe cliché. I mean, who the hell wouldn’t want a love letter written for them? Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets, so in comparison I’m not asking for a lot. I’ve always held a special place for love letters because they tread the very fine line between poetry and prose. As an art form, they’re fascinating and as a gift, they’re precious! Given that they’ve been written since time immemorial, clearly I’m not the first person to think that love letters are as cool as they are. To learn more about this tradition that prints love into pulpy paper, I spoke to English literature professor Dr. Gregory Mackie — one of my favourite profs and famously-known as an Oscar Wilde buff. Mackie specializes in Victorian and Modernist literature and curated “A Queer Century, 1869-1969,”an exhibit for the UBC Rare Books and Special Collection in 2019 which included tributes between lovers amongst other artifacts of queer history. It was an event held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in Canada. “One of the most interesting objects in the entire exhibition was a letter. It was a postcard sent between two women in France in the 19th century,” said Mackie. “When the affection between the two women couldn’t be openly expressed, they resorted to a code. A graduate student at the time decoded it.” “The interesting thing about love letters as objects is that they cross between the public and the private. If it’s a physical letter, then it has to circulate in a semi-public manner — in an envelope through the mail.” When I asked him if the persistence of the tradition has changed since our entry into the digital age, he shared how intimacy can be tangled up with tangibility. “We have hung onto the idea that a handwritten letter has more meaning, or more intimacy than something that’s mediated by a screen,” he said. “You can do other things to a physical letter that you can’t do to an electronic one. People used to traditionally put perfume, or press flowers in letters to express certain things.” Mackie asked me if I knew what “SWAK” means, a term which is apparently a generational test since those of a certain age and younger don’t know what this means. To my great dismay, I did, in fact, fail. “It means ‘sealed with a kiss.’ It reflects that a letter is sealed … a wax seal hundreds of years ago or the sticker-y stuff we have today,” said Mackie. “It is an old term that indicates that the physical body of the sender is imprinted on the object.” Once again, I must remind you that I’m a romantic, and felt super mushy hearing about this stuff! It also gave me ideas of how to make my own love letters more intimate, since I enjoy writing them too. My last question to Mackie was about whether we can put an exact or approximate date to the beginning of writing love letters as a tradition. Hint: we can’t. “It’s old as human beings have been writing,” he said. “As long as the personal letter as a form has existed, it would’ve been an expression of romantic, sentimental and erotic love.” Love NestisThe Ubyssey s dating column — both satire and serious.

crimson_2023_131,"Thecontroversy around experimentsinvolving infant monkeys and their mothers in professor Margaret S. Livingstone’s lab at Harvard Medical School highlights the importance of education at the intersection of science and ethics. It also calls our attention to a very specific set of injustices happening within our own community. As a student in the Master of Bioethics program at Harvard Medical School, I am deeply invested in the ethics underpinning the research on which we base our medical advancements. It’s clear that other people are, too. Recently, tens of thousands of individuals, including members of the Harvard community, havesigned petitionsandletters that get it right: Despite herstatements to the contrary, Livingstone’s research is cruel, unnecessary, and morally indefensible. The backlash against invasive research on primate infants and their mothers is no surprise. Such research conflicts with some of our strongest beliefs. Our sense of how we ought to behave — the normative component of ethics — is informed by deeply ingrained values stemming from culture, religion, our families, and more. The belief that we should not harm others is a value that’s widely accepted and reflected in law. But our actions and laws sometimes exclude animals from this sphere of moral consideration, even though they should not. It turns out that Americans are concerned with how animals are treated in all settings, including scientific research.According to Gallup, 67 percent of Americans surveyed indicated they’re “Very/Somewhat Concerned” with the treatment of animals used in research. Only three percent of respondents said they believed animals need minimal protections from harm “since they are just animals.” That we love and care about animals is no surprise. They’re members of our families. We’ve formed core childhood memories with them during visits to parks, on camping trips, and in classrooms. Why, then, do we accept a status quo that says it is acceptable to harm animals in scientific research so long as there’s a small chance it might benefit humans? Many gifts given to us by scientific research have come at the expense of the subjects involved in that research, some of whom have been human, the majority of whom have been nonhuman, and nearly all of whom can suffer and feel pain. Still, according to the National Institutes of Health, an estimated95 percent of drugsproven safe and effective in animal models fail during human clinical trials. Both humans and animals are harmed by such failures. The claim that Livingstone’s current research is scientifically justifiable has been criticized by individuals with far more expertise in primatology, neurobiology, and bioethics than myself, and I will only point you totheir well-documenteddissenting views. It should be clear: It is a mistake to question the credibility of their views by classifying them as emotional appeals. We cannot and should not disconnect one of the defining features of humanity — our capacity for empathy — from our moral sensibilities. As bioethicists-in-training at HMS, we’re taught to interrogate our emotional biases and carefully consider them in decision-making — not to silence or dismiss them. Where would we be if we stuffed our emotions into our pockets when witnessing suffering and injustice? Bearing witness to suffering has inspired critical social change in response to atrocities like slavery, apartheid, and the Holocaust. And,as I’ve argued before, excluding emotion from research does not make for good science. Moreover, it’s been demonstrated that people who care for animals in research labs suffersevere mental anguish. There is harm in ignoring emotion and violating one’s own moral values. But the harder question we need to answer is: Even if this research is beneficial to humanity, should we be doing it? Livingstone’s research is legal, but legality is not morality. We can all easily recall many instances in which what was legal was shockingly immoral. Is human exceptionalism in scientific research different from the other forms of legalized exceptionalism that have hurt vulnerable groups? Neither the awards and large sums of funding that Dr. Livingstone’s research on monkeys has received, nor its approval by Harvard’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, indicates it is ethical or even necessary. IACUCs are self-regulating bodies whose standards vary by institution and based on the individual composition of each IACUC. This does not make those involved in this research immoral people. Instead, it evidences a broken system that devalues the moral worth of nonhuman animals. Alternative technologies to replace animals in research are in development, but they aren’t yet fully sufficient. This shouldn’t hold us back. It is intellectually dishonest to use moral arguments to justify technological and scientific insufficiencies. Our present (and seemingly temporary inability to completely replace monkeys with non-sentient technologies does not make their exploitation ethically justifiable — not even when it might help humans. In the meantime, we can commit to urgently advancing thosereplacement technologies. We can also commit to research frameworks thatemphasize non-maleficenceto better protect animals. Harvard prides itself on being a leader, and this is a place where it can lead. Being critical of institutional practices is not a rejection of the institution or its constituents. As a proud Harvard Medical School student, I aim to elevate both myself and our school. Just as I push myself to question my long-held beliefs, so too should the place where I learn. We’re fortunate to be surrounded by abundant intellect and innovation. Here in the Harvard ecosystem,viable alternativesto animal research are being developed. Sometimes, we neglect to question the status quo. At a leading institution like ours, that’s just not good enough.

Stuck in the midweek slump? Need a pick-me-up? Grab your friends and check out the free weekly Comedy Corner shows every Wednesday night at 8:30 p.m. in the Modern Languages building Room 350. Reem Farhat is a sophomore studying film and television and a member of the club. “It’s like a perfect midweek reset; a midweek laugh,” Farhat said. “Comedy Corner is especially special because nothing we do is for one type of person. We come from all sorts of majors and the comedy appeals to everyone.” Last week I had the opportunity to attend one of Comedy Corner’s many practice sessions. I was expecting to sit back and observe, but I was immediately beckoned on stage and made a temporary member of the group. They then created an entire skit about the happenings of my day right before my eyes. The members were extremely friendly and welcoming — it was evident how much they enjoy what they do. I was warmed by how supportive they were of one another for stepping out of their comfort zones. Nothing at the weekly shows is planned or staged, instead featuring improv comedy. J Grigory, a senior studying molecular and cellular biology and co-director of Comedy Corner, gave a rundown of what improv is. “The short synopsis that we give people is that it’s acting without a script,” Grigory said. “We are going to put on a play for an audience, but we don’t know what the play is yet. And neither does the audience. And we’re going to figure it out with their help.” One of the key features of the weekly shows is interactivity. During the skits, such as Quick Edit, New Choice and Talk Show Advice, the audience members have a chance to participate by yelling out suggestions. All of the members employ a variety of comedy techniques, including fake accents, strong emotions and even physical stunts. I cannot agree more with the president and other co-director of the group Doug Adam Hauck, a senior studying industrial engineering when he said that Comedy Corner is a “break from the real world.” I was surprised by how clever, interactive and relatable the mini-show that they put on for me was. I left wanting more! To keep things fresh, the weekly shows incorporate a different theme, such as holidays, “The Bachelor” and silly wigs. Some of these themes are appropriately tradition-based, considering Comedy Corner is the nation’s longest-running collegiate comedy show operating since 1979. If you are interested in becoming a new member of Comedy Corner, auditions are held at the beginning of every semester. Those who audition do not need to have anything prepared beforehand. “Don’t worry if you’ve never done improv before. We guide you through it. It’s not as scary as it looks. It’s just being yourself. You are entering a really fun group of people. And to me, it added a whole other element to my college career,” Hauck said. Gabe Berkey, a sophomore studying business and a new member of the club, captures it best, “It’s a free thing to do on Wednesday nights, and we are funny.” Comedy Corner is bare-boned comedy at its very best — simply a group of funny people and a stage that does not require anything else to let the humor shine. The weekly shows are a hidden escape found right on campus. Follow Comedy Corner onInstagram@comedycornerua andTwitter@comedycorner for show updates and other news. Follow theDaily WildcatonTwitter"
crimson_2023_75,"Intellectual diversity and academic freedom have long been crucial tenets of education. But these ideals are under attack in Florida — a development that should worry us all. On the first day of Black History Month, the College Boardannounced it was alteringthe curriculum for its Advanced Placement course in African American Studies after Florida’s Department of Educationrejected the coursedays earlier, arguing it violated Florida law and “lacked educational value.”Seemingly succumbingto the department’s demands to come “into compliance,” the College Board stripped away and minimized many scholars and subjects central to Blackness in the United States, from Black feminism to Black Lives Matter. This dispute is the latest ideological swing against education in Florida. As the stateplans to overhaulits higher education system by eliminating diversity and equity programs, Florida teachers arehiding their classroom booksto avoid felony charges for controversial material. What constitutes “compliance” with these increasingly draconian laws in Florida is unclear. One thing is clear, though: Many conservatives are loving it. At the helm of this effort is the culture warrior Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who appears to be throwing the Republican base red meat before a rumored 2024 presidential bid. Indeed, the subjects cut from the AP African American Studies curriculum read like a laundry list of Republican complaints about “wokeness” in education. Riding a dominant re-election win, DeSantisdeclared in his victory speech, “Florida is where woke goes to die.” In some ways, this is nothing new. Conservatism in the United States has long had a strain of anti-intellectualism. In the 1970s, conservative leaders like Paul Weyrichsteered the Republican Party to the right, targeting movements prevalent in academic circles, like civil rights. The resulting New Right movement would carry Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump to the White House. Today, driven by conspiratorial fears and adenigration of the pursuit of knowledge, many conservativesreject what they perceive as“out-of-touch” social elites and the academic institutions they occupy. I am the first to admit that elitism exerts itself in tangible ways here at Harvard and, undoubtedly, at many prestigious institutions of higher learning. But the recent push from DeSantis — a graduate of Harvard Law School himself — distorts and places undue blame on academic institutions for infecting young people with “woke” ideologies. And now, anti-intellectualism is the letter of the law in the state of Florida. This should set off alarm bells for anyone who cares about academic freedom. Schools and universities have a longstanding tradition of fostering curiosity by promoting intellectual diversity. This tradition is a cornerstone of academic freedom and an essential component of a well-rounded education. Courses like African American Studies bring new insights to our understanding of the world, allowing students to explore its complexities, challenge conventional wisdom, and form their own opinions. Politically motivated efforts to threaten this vital tradition should disturb all Americans, regardless of viewpoint. When DeSantisappoints a blatantly partisanboard of trustees at the New College of Florida andcalls on teachersto clear books from classroom shelves, everyone should pay attention. This rogue movement is not only a blatant attempt to impose a singularly conservative agenda on education but also a threat to the very essence of what makes education meaningful. At Harvard, we have a long history of trying to foster intellectual diversity and promote academic freedom. And however uneasy the development, I genuinely believe in upholding these principles. So let’s be clear. It’s one thing to support robust academic free speech. It’s another to reject legitimate history because you disagree with it. Consider DeSantis’tirade against a proposedAP African American Studies section on Queer Theory. “Who would say that an important part of Black history is Queer Theory?” DeSantis asked. Students who have learned the likes ofbell hooks,Marsha P. Johnson, andJames A. Baldwinshould scoff at his statement. Ironically, DeSantis is applying the exact kind of pressure he claims he wants to eliminate — a sort of intimidation aimed at coercing educational institutions to conform to particular ideologies. Instead of allowing students the choice to take the course as initially designed, the state hides behind upholding the values of “Western civilization” — at the expense of Black literature. Black history is American history, even the parts that conservatives find unpalatable. Purging Black scholars and salient racial topics like Black Lives Matter is a direct assault on academic free speech and intellectual freedom throughout the United States. Unfortunately, the College Board seems to have allowed DeSantis to do so. While this crusade belongs to Governor DeSantis and his allies, we would all be wise to renew our commitment to academic freedom. Even at Harvard, it’s simply too easy to avoid and even eschew uncomfortable views. But there is immense value in exposing students to varied perspectives, including those on the right. I grew up in the South. While joining people for school and church, I was frequently exposed to conservative ideas with which I disagreed. I still vehemently oppose the tenets of conservatism; nonetheless, because of that exposure, I saw my peers as people first, not their ideas. Only by committing ourselves to the principles of intellectual freedom can we promote a more informed, diverse, and inclusive understanding of the world and its complexities. It is our responsibility to protect the legacy of intellectual diversity at Harvard and in higher education as a whole. So when it comes to what’s happening in Florida, we must stop the purge. But we shouldn’t stop there. Let’s cultivate a rich, intellectual environment anywhere we can. Clyve Lawrence ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Government concentrator in Adams House."
crimson_2023_166,"If everyone lived according to the rules of my mother, there wouldn’t be a messy bedroom in sight and we would each play an equal role in dinner preparation. Cars would be abandoned for bikes and public transportation, and global production of single-use plastics would halt immediately. And we would all have worked in a restaurant sometime before the age of 30. I only truly understood my mom’s enduring insistence on the value of restaurant work this summer, when I found myself back in my childhood home with no plans for the foreseeable future. June had snuck up and rendered me purposeless and green with envy, separated from my peers who had the foresight to apply to resume-worthy internship opportunities or metamorphic study abroad programs. After a wildly unsuccessful last minute application scramble and a slew of cold emails met with no response, I took to the streets of Los Angeles with 20 copies of my resume in hand, fueled by a sense of desperate hope. By some miracle, within a few days, I had landed a part-time, minimum wage job at a local restaurant. My role at the restaurant was expansive: taking orders, serving food, bussing tables, making drinks, cleaning and restocking — you get the idea. While my position was rather ambiguous, what I learned from my time there was clear. Two months in the food service industry gave me a rudimentary understanding of the Spanish language, an indelible urge to shout “behind!” when passing behind someone, and an irrational fear of getting trapped in a walk-in cooler — but most importantly, this experience gave me invaluable perspective. From my interactions across the counter, I learned patience. I met many a Karen whose food was just a little too cold or service a little too slow (I would say we saw an average of three a day . My faith in human decency was tested each time an American Express Platinum cardholder didn’t leave a tip. The receiving end of a service job presented social challenges unlike anything I had ever experienced at Harvard. From my interactions behind the counter, I learned gratitude. The 0.9 mile walk to the Quad now feels like nothing compared to the two-hour commute one of my coworkers made everyday. No paper nor problem set will ever compare to the sheer chaos that is the Monday lunch shift. What I do — what we all do — at this school is not as hard as it once seemed. One could make the argument that, as Harvard students, our annual academic hiatuses are best spent doing even more learning or working in a lucrative industry, hunched over an office desk or sitting at a lab bench. To that, I say: Ifwe truly hope to leave this school“to better serve thy country and thy kind,” we must first possess a baseline understanding of this so-called country and kind. This isn’t the kind of understanding that can be gleaned from taking notes in a lecture hall, reading assigned texts, or even volunteering at a charitable organization. This kind of understanding can only be found via work that doesn’t necessarily boost a LinkedIn profile, isn’t always glorious, and may feel disconnected from the intellectual aspects of our lives. For many Americans, working in a restaurant is not a novelty or a choice but a necessary source of income and stability. However, the Harvard student body is hardly reflective of this vast majority. Harvard Economics professor Raj Chetty ’00 found that a whopping67 percent of Harvard undergraduatescome from the top 20 percent of the national income distribution, while a mere 4.5 percent come from the bottom 20 percent. Many students here have never and will never work a restaurant job. If this sort of work is a choice for you — perhaps even one you could avoid entirely — I implore you to give some serious thought to this choice. Then if, God forbid, you ever find yourself sans summer internship or fresh out of college and unemployed, take a walk around your neighborhood and see if any restaurants are hiring. I think you just may find yourself to be a better person for it. And even if you don’t, my mom certainly will. Violet T. M. Barron ’26, a Crimson Editorial Editor, lives in Adams House."
stanforddaily_2023_55,"As I walk around campus reading chalked messages and posters, and as I read The Stanford Daily, the Stanford Report and the Stanford Review, I am saddened. This is not the Stanford that once made me so proud to be its provost. There were many occasions for pride during my years as provost:Nobel Prizeannouncements,winsat the Rose Bowl, student performances in MemAud. But for me, my proudest day at Stanford was Jan. 29, 2010. That was the day we werevisitedby the Westboro Baptist Church, a strange cult that traveled the country to spread their message of hate toward gays, members of the Armed Forces and, particularly, Jews. This stop on their tour was targeted at Stanford Hillel, where they planned to spew their deranged antisemitism toward members of the Stanford Community. When word of their coming spread through campus, the president and I received many demands that we prevent them from demonstrating. We could have. We are a private university on private property, and we can prevent access to outsiders if we so choose. But we did not. We are a university, and a university stands for nothing if not the free expression of viewpoints — true or false, supported or unsupported, agreeable or repugnant. Word spread that the university would not prevent the demonstration, that the Westboro “Church” would be allowed to chant their hate at Hillel’s front door. The University would of course physically protect the members of Hillel, but equally protect the unwelcome Westboro visitors. Then the day arrived. No plans were made, no call went out, but the Stanford community responded on its own. Hundreds and hundreds of Stanford students, faculty and staff spontaneously arrived to surround Hillel in a community embrace. At the front of the Stanford crowd was the Muslim Student Awareness Network and the Islamic Society of Stanford, proudly showing their support for their Jewish counterparts. Talisman showed up and led the crowd with songs of love and grace. Then from the edge of the throng a bagpiper played “Amazing Grace,” and we all joined in. Eventually, our Westboro guests packed up their signs of hate and quietly left campus. They never made Stanford a stop on their odious tours again. As I said at the time, I have never been prouder of our university. Others agreed. But something has been lost, at our university and in our society at large, something we desperately need to get back: the ability to disagree, to dispute, to debate, without questioning our opponents’ fundamental dignity and humanity. In 2010, we did not have a DEI program to mandate diversity and inclusion. This was not because there was no strife or hatred in the world. The Intifada was a recent memory, and the U.S. was still responding to the events of 9/11. But we saw ourselves as a community of scholars, who approached even the most agonizing events with compassion and understanding — and a determination to find a solution. Our current president and provost have received a great deal of criticism from students and alumni who want them to take a stand, to come down clearly and unequivocally in favor of their own preferred stance. But President Richard Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez have done exactly what a president and provost should do. It is their responsibility, above all, to maintain the potential for rational, respectful debate, even about the most tragic and divisive circumstances facing the world. It is our responsibility as an academic community to engage in this debate with compassion and respect for those with whom we disagree, not to look to the university to assure us that our side is right. John Etchemendy served as the 12th provost of Stanford University from 2000 to 2017. The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.

crimson_2023_22,"Israel is a beautiful nation whose government has committedunspeakable crimes. For many, only half of that sentence will register. On our campus, viewpoints have grown highly polarized at a time when we most need solidarity. Chants of “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” clash with “Am Yisrael Chai” until the discordance becomes deafening. Indistinguishable noise is as productive as silence. The fights for Palestinian and Israeli self-determination need not be mutually exclusive. As a Jew, I’ve found myself returning to this truth time and time again amidst the constant stream of news, volatile campus discourse, and my own internal debate over the past week and a half. It is possible to grieve for the Israeli people while acknowledging their government’s past and likely present violations of international humanitarian law. I do not betray my people by demanding more of our leadership. Likewise, it is possible to grieve for the Palestinian people while acknowledging the role Hamas has played in this bloodshed. Asmanyhaveaptlynoted, the statement released Saturday by the Harvard Undergraduate Palestinian Solidarity Committee calling the government of Israel “entirely responsible” for ongoing violence in the region was dangerously reductionist. While Israel has committed countless atrocities, it is not the sole perpetrator in this recent conflict. The PSC’s original statement shamefully fails to identify Hamas,designated a terrorist organizationby many nations, as complicit. Hamas does not simply act out of solidarity with Palestine, but necessarily out of hate for Israel. It seeks the complete and total elimination of the Jewish state, as it has since its inception in the 1980s. The PSC’s failure to place blame on Hamas is striking and saddening, and in fact weakens the legitimate call to end a cycle of violence which has trapped Palestinians for decades. Yet two wrongs don’t make a right. While the PSC’s statement has this glaring flaw, the response has been unacceptable. This week, I watched in horror as the safety of pro-Palestinian activists — many of them students of color, and many of them my friends — was compromised, their identitiesblasted across the internetand displayed on a “doxxing truck” in Harvard Square. To add insult to injury, in its statements, Harvard administration has remained cowardly vague. The University has provided four statements so far: the first,too late and too weak; the second, denouncing Hamas butdistancing the University from the student groupswho signed with the PSC; the third, redirecting students with safety concerns to other resources; and the fourth, a broadrejection of hate and harassmentand affirmation of free expression, with no direct reference to the groups targeted. None of the statementsare enoughto address the urgent threat to student security. I understand why my peers on the PSC and their allies are irate, because I am too. They have been attacked, largely on the basis of one sentence, and the very institution designed to protect such intellectual discourse has failed to do so. Still, I urge them not to let their fight for the human rights of the Palestinian people and effort to contextualize this violence become tacit acceptance of terrorism. I understand whymy Jewish peers mourn, because I do too. Israel is the land in which I had my bat mitzvah six and a half years ago at the Western Wall. It is the birthplace of significant technological advancements like drip irrigation, and home to a people whose every greeting and parting, “shalom,” translates to “peace.” It has been unimaginably hard — the kind of hard that can only be put into tears, never words — to observe helplessly asmore than 1,400Israelis have beenkilled, raped, and tortured. Hyperfixation on what the PSC’s statement lacks, rather than what it aims to reveal, is equally unproductive. I, along with my fellow Jewish students, cannot let grief distort the cruelty of Israel’s crimes. We must turn this devastation into a call to action and demand that the Netanyahu administration immediately lay down their arms;restore basic necessities, like fuel and electricity, to the roughly 2.2 million residents of Gaza; and lift the callous 16-year blockade it has imposed on a population that was majority below the poverty line as of 2017 and is nearly half children today. Israeli occupation must end on all fronts: The government should seize this momentum and promptly remove its settlements from the West Bank, too. The current conflict in Israel and Palestine has unmasked deep injustices in the region and brought them to the forefront of public consciousness. I do not know when the fighting will end, but when it does, I know that the region cannot return to a status quo marked by unthinkable Palestinian suffering. To my fellow Jews: Now, more than ever, we need not look any further than our faith for guidance. A fundamental principle of Reform Judaism, the tradition I grew up in, is that of “tikkun olam,” which translates to “repairing the world.” Tikkun olam is rooted in the fact that persecution is intrinsically intertwined with the collective Jewish identity. Our tragic history engenders us with a particular obligation to recognize injustice, even if its perpetrators are the very leaders we have elected to office. We must fight to ensure that the oppression which has plagued us — from biblical enslavement in Egypt to systematic extermination in Auschwitz — does not extend to others. We cannot allow the violence unfolding abroad to drive us away from each other — or from the capacity for empathy — at home. In the face of devastating loss, the path forward is for each of us to make concessions, take time to understand opposing perspectives, and seek out the commonalities and the ways in which our perspectives might not be so different after all. To say this path will be easy would be a lie. But to say we have any other option would be a lie, too. Violet T. M. Barron ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Adams House.

crimson_2023_59,"Every winter, thousands of high schoolers descend on the halls of the Sheraton Boston Hotel to participate in a series of esteemed high school speech and debate conferences hosted by Harvard student groups: Harvard Model United Nations and Harvard Model Congress. These conferences are widely regarded as some of the most prestigious and competitive of their kind. As a high school debater myself, I eagerly awaited the HMUN conference, which my school’s team attended each January. Although competition was tough, nothing could ever beat the satisfaction of coming home from Boston with a gavel — the prize given to each winner — in hand. While my experience with high school debate provided me with invaluable knowledge of public speaking and leadership, not everyone has the opportunity to participate in speech and debate equitably. Across the circuit, race and gender-based discrimination often takes place between competitors. At a conference my freshman year, I watched as several white male competitors excluded an East Asian female from collaboration because she “had coronavirus.” My junior year, I watched as my teammates exchanged racially insensitive messages over Snapchat. Though these incidents did not occur at Harvard conferences, they are reflective of larger patterns of discrimination faced by minority debaters, which can bias success in an activity with high stakes for college admissions and beyond. Female high school students are around 30 percentmore likely to quitspeech and debate than their male competitors — a disparity likely exacerbated by the increased discrimination they face on circuits. Speech and debate also has a long history of excluding participants of color. Owing to their preeminence, HMUN and HMC are uniquely poised to pioneer efforts to equalize inequities within high school speech and debate. Already, Harvard speech and debate conferences have made efforts at diversity, equity, and inclusion. HMUN and HMC have, admirably, established annual scholarship initiatives for competitors, and HMC runs a free mentorship program for local Boston high schools. Still, they can go further. HMUN and HMC both have anti-discrimination policies, but more needs to be done to improve their enforcement. To ensure students feel respected in these spaces, organizations should reevaluate the mechanisms they have for intervening in cases of discrimination. As a competitor, I often felt uncomfortable speaking out against incidents of bias or discrimination due to pressure from my team and fear of judgment from other delegates on my committee. Conferences should adapt their policies to account for these realities faced by minority participants. Given the importance of these competitions, this path towards improvement must be followed with urgency. Not only would this foster a more inclusive environment for competitors of marginalized identities, but it may also serve to benefit college applicants of color in a post-affirmative action world. Success on competitive speech and debate circuits isa proven pipelinetoward admission to elite institutions of higher education. Before arriving here, many Harvard students participate in some form of high school speech and debate. The Crimson’sannual survey for incoming freshmenfound that more than 27 percent of respondents from the Class of 2027 participated in debate in high school, while approximately 19 percent participated in model United Nations. Creating a more welcoming environment for talented students of color at speech and debate conferences would improve this important tool for building the resumes of competitors of color and familiarizing them with college students and campuses. At the end of the day, I am still grateful for the skills I gained from my time in competitive high school speech and debate and for the guidance I received from Harvard students through HMUN. I only ask that these organizations ensure that future competitors of color have the same access to the opportunities for growth and development that I had. I hope that the paths of competitors of color who come after me are as smooth as possible. I hope that they do not have to worry about more than the next gavel. Jasmine N.

stanforddaily_2023_79,"President Marc Tessier-Lavigne expressed unusual fervor about the Hoover Institution when several members of the Faculty Senate proposed aresolutionearlier this month to remove Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Mercer’s positions on Stanford’s Hoover Board of Overseers. The move would be purely symbolic, since the Faculty Senate does not have the power to remove Hoover Board members. Tessier-Lavignesaidthat, “For the senate to adopt this resolution would be to set itself up as a thought police.” Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of State and Director of the Hoover Institution,citedacademic freedom as a reason to keep Murdoch and Mercer on the Board: “The senate’s foundational statement of academic freedom holds that expression of the widest range of viewpoints should be encouraged free from institutional orthodoxy and from internal and or external coercion,” Rice said. However, the resolution was not a frivolous measure to be dismissed with a wave of the hand. Over 90 faculty members wrote anopen letterto University leadership in March, urging it to denounce Murdoch’s membership on Hoover’s Board. By implying that these faculty members are acting as “thought police,” MTL has made a very strong accusation against his colleagues. It is therefore worth revisiting Stanford’s own official statement on academic freedom, and evaluating whether Murdoch and Mercer’s tenures on Hoover’s Board of Overseers are protected by that statement. The Statement on Academic Freedomfrom the Stanford Faculty Handbook states: “Decisions concerning:(1 the search for, and appointment and promotion of faculty;(2 the assignment of teaching and other primarily academic responsibilities;(3 the support and sponsorship of scholarly research; and(4 any other granting or withholding of benefits or imposition of burdensshall be made without regard to a person’s political, social, or other views not directly related to academic values or to the assumption of academic responsibilities; without regard to the conduct of a person holding an appointment at Stanford unless such conduct is directly related to academic values or to the assumption of academic responsibilities… and without regard to an individual’s race, ethnic origin, sex or religion.” According to the Hoover Institution’s website, theBoard of Overseersis responsible for “overseeing the strategic direction and financial health of the Hoover Institution and the preservation of its institutional independence within the framework of Stanford University.” It is an advisory board whose members are not considered Stanford faculty; according to their self-description, these members do not have teaching or academic responsibilities assigned by Stanford University. They do not conduct research. The only section of the University’s pledge to Academic Freedom that may apply to the Board of Overseers is the granting of “benefits:” in this case, the prestige of being a member of the Board. Still, let’s consider that Murdoch’s membership of the Board comes under this commitment to academic freedom. The Statement on Academic Freedom clearly says that decisions should be made “without regard to a person’s political, social, or other views…unless such conduct is directly related to academic values”(emphasis added . In his Op-Ed on the Faculty Senate motion, Professor Jonathan Berkframesthe calls for Murdoch’s removal as solely about his news outlets’ publication of racist and sexist views. He argues that “taking the position that there are subjects and views that are not acceptable under academic freedom” is antithetical to academic freedom, and we agree. But this is a mischaracterization of what Murdoch is truly responsible for: not just racism and sexism, butknowingly allowingthe publication of falsehoods about the 2020 election. This is not only our opinion, but alsothe opinion of Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis, who stated that we can infer Rupert Murdoch “either knew Dominion had not manipulated the election or at least recklessly disregarded the truth when they allegedly caused Fox News to propagate its claims about Dominion.” Murdoch had reportedly told Trump that he had lost the election a few days after the fact, in direct contradiction to the claims being made by Fox News at the time. Needless to say, actual malice — the knowing or reckless publication of false information — would violate the core purpose of Academic Freedom: the pursuit and dissemination of truth. If the lawsuit had not been settled, a jury would have determined whether Murdoch had committed actual malice, which experts believe to have beenlikely. Regardless of the trial outcome, we are concerned that, given the body of evidence revealed by Dominion, Marc Tessier-Lavigne and Condoleezza Rice among others did not engage with faculty members’ very real concerns about platforming and elevating Murdoch’s position through his appointment on the Hoover Board of Overseers. Murdoch’s position on the Board is not a question of freedom of speech. Murdoch is allowed to speak freely — his ownership of multiple mass media has in fact elevated his ability to speak. Rather, it is a question of who should represent Stanford. MTL said that a resolution that simply disapproves of Murdoch’s appointment would impose “institutional orthodoxy” and a “chilling effect.” We agree that there is no such thing as an untrue opinion, and that University policies should not restrict the expression of opinions. But even constitutional law does not protect the willful propagation of untrue facts. Why should Stanford choose to give prestige to someone who is all but proven to have done so? The concepts of academic freedom and freedom of speech, which we all prize at Stanford, should not be mishandled in this way. The protection of academic freedom, if it even protects Murdoch, is certainly in question after the revelations of the Dominion lawsuit. At the very least, we believe that University leadership should have engaged in a good faith dialogue with faculty members, rather than Condoleezza Rice telling a professor, “You have been a problem this whole time,” and throwing around weightyaccusationsto invalidate dissent. If the leaders of the University, who claim to have such a strong commitment to the free interchange of ideas, cannot even demonstrate a willingness to respond to the concerns of their colleagues, what example does that set for the student body? What does that say about Stanford? We strongly believe that University leadership — namely President Marc Tessier-Lavigne, Provost Persis Drell, Jerry Yang (Chair of the Stanford Board of Trustees and Condoleezza Rice (Director of the Hoover Institution — should have responded to theoriginal letterfrom faculty members. Those leaders should now defend their position in harboring Murdoch and Mercerspecifically, rather than making illusory claims about academic freedom and free speech. If they refuse to do so, they demonstrate disdain not only towards our faculty, but the very values that they claim to protect.

rice_thresher_2023_56,"ByNicholas Ma2/28/23 10:46pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Rice is not serious enough about its climate pledges. On February 11, when Rice’s campus was enmeshed by theRice Marriage Pact, Rice’s2030 Carbon Neutralpledge celebrated its one year anniversary. Rice hasn’t yet published any progress towards emissions reduction or other sustainability metrics. Missing data is not just an administrative inaction, but reveals how the pledges are actually built on flawed “net zero” frameworks and problematic“carbon offsets.” What counts as carbon emissions? Do historical emissions count? How about the increasingsocial cost of carbon? Rice must make a public commitment to publishing measurable sustainability goals and data and supporting student-led sustainability initiatives. Rice was already behind many of its institutional peers towards sustainability. The most problematic of all is the lack of accountability in its vague, faraway carbon neutral plan. There is no commitment to report their progress in the email sent from President Leebron, as many other leading institutions do;Harvard,Yale,Penn,Duke,Vanderbilt, just to name a few, release their sustainability report annually. Additionally, Rice’s students are left out of the loop in its goal-setting and implementation process, which further weakens the credibility of the promise.HarvardandUniversity of Pennsylvania, for example, established task forces and committees that involve their students to actively participate in the planning process. In 2015, prior to the signing of the Paris Climate Accords,more than 200 universitiesshowed their support for global climate action by signing the American Campus Act on Climate Pledge. All Ivy Leagues and most of the so-called T30 schools signed it, except for Rice. It is also interesting to note that the timing of the 2030 pledge happened around the same time when student climate activists from Yale, Stanford, Princeton, MIT and Vanderbilt were attracting national attention calling fordivestment in fossil fuels. The above trends, to me, show how Rice is struggling to position itself in the ongoing climate movement: First, located in the energy capital, Rice’s tremendous growth is historically based on revenues from traditional energy, which, in turn, provides access to exceptional and unconventional educational resources to one of the most diverse student body by all metrics. Anyone who studies or works at Rice faces a moral ambivalence surrounded by path-dependent conflict of interests when exercising their agency to promote positive change. Second, the national movements from other schools should serve as a source of inspiration and empowerment for Rice students, recognizing that change, albeit gradual, can be made. There is already an incremental force across the globe pushing each and every one of us to the center stage for the imminent and substantial danger along the gulf coast and beyond. So we, as students, should demand Rice for more accountability. Transparency is the first ingredient for accountability and continual improvement. The school should publish their goals and progress in a cyclical manner. It not only allows our community to track progress toward meeting the commitments, but also helps uncover new insights and make smarter decisions. We should demand for more student engagement. The Student Association has the obligation to aggregate student voices and communicate them to the school. At the same time, departments and student organizations should also host programs to promote civic engagement and spread energy usage awareness. We Owls are proud to be part of an institution which deeply embeds the value of innovation, “unconventional wisdom,” to its core, and we are celebrating and expressing our spirit of creativity in all shapes and forms. (For example:Rice Student and Professor built reactors that will decarbonize the chemical industry Hence, the greatest contribution of Rice towards fighting climate change is itsstudent initiatives. Rice should embrace its historical mission and pioneer in ambitious and robust emission reductions, not because it is easy, but because it is hard. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2023_96,"I was somewhat disappointed when the Undergraduate Senate (UGS declined to adopt theC-12’s well-considered Honor Code revisions, which would have allowed exam proctoring under the auspices of a study. As a five-time TA across three departments, I personally see no value to the Honor Code’s prohibition on proctoring. But my disappointment with the UGS was dwarfed by my dismay at the Faculty Senate’s unilateral action invoking the“nuclear option,”seizing full control over the Honor Code for itself and enacting an outright reversal of the proctoring prohibition rather than the C-12’s recommended study on proctoring. Prior to the Faculty Senate’s extraordinary action, judicial amendments required approval from the UGS, the Graduate Student Council, the Faculty Senate and the University President to enter into effect. This collaborative and co-decisional process between faculty and students is rare and precious among institutions of higher education. It reflects a commitment to act as collaborators in the broader academic project that we as teachers and learners partake in. Students should be able to trust when the University says student approval, through the UGS, is necessary for judicial amendments. Truly extraordinary circumstances that genuinely foreclose student input should be required as justification for the unilateral nuclear option — and surely, those circumstances do not include the mere continuation of policy that was originally approved by the faculty and has been in place for many decades. TheHonor Codebegins by noting that: “The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students, individually and collectively.” It is the students’ individual and collective undertaking that gives the Honor Code more moral authority, and imposes on students more moral responsibility, than corresponding policies at other universities. The Faculty Senate’s action abandons this principle and transforms the Honor Code into an imposition of the faculty. Stanford can do better, and has done better, than this. When I was part of asix-student teamtasked by the Provost to research and recommend improvements to Stanford’s internal grievance processes, I had the honor of working with Stanford administrators and faculty who grappled thoughtfully and deliberately with difficult institutional design questions, even though it would have been easier to simply impose changes through administrative fiat. The Faculty Senate should consider taking the same thoughtful and deliberative approach, rather than rashly jettisoning decades of shared governance. And if, as supporters of the Faculty Senate’s actionacknowledge, “much cheating happens in settings other than in-class exams,” which are unaffected by proctoring, it becomes even more important for the faculty to maintain a trusting and collaborative working relationship with students to address cheating in those settings as well. Proctoring alone is not a panacea for the most significant Honor Code issues, and mutual trust will be necessary for sustained progress. If the Faculty Senate believes (as I do after dialogue and consideration that the UGS’s refusal to adopt the C-12’s recommendations was incorrect, it should have asked that the UGS submit the issue to a referendum or otherwise sought review from the student body. The exercise of the Faculty Senate’s extraordinary powers to strip the UGS of co-decisional authority over the Honor Code was a grossly coercive and illegitimate response to the UGS’s vote, and leaves a bitter taste in my mouth in the last quarter of my five years at Stanford. In the spirit of collaboration and shared governance, I urge the Faculty Senate to rescind its unilateral decision and reaffirm the precious co-governance principles that foster faculty-student collaboration. And if the Faculty Senate does its part, the UGS should too: voting to allow a study on proctoring will show the UGS’s sincere commitment to responsibly exercise its own shared governance functions.

state_press_2023_22,"SCETL s proponents have labeled the school as an addition to diverse thought that exists on campus, but its critics have had issues with its secretive establishment and Koch-backed institutions. The Arizona State Legislature and ASU leadership should prioritize resources for the progressive institutions that exist at the University, not the Koch and conservative state Legislature-backedSchool of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership. This is especially important because of escalating attacks on public education and the attached bigoted fervor spearheaded by calls to ban books and remove school curricula that don t reflect conservative views of how society should be. SCETLdebuted at ASU in Spring 2017, and it absorbed two Koch-brother-funded institutions previously under the School of Historical, Philosophical and Religious Studies. SCETL s proponents have labeled the school as an addition to diverse thought that exists on campus, but itscriticshave had issues with its secretive establishment and Koch-backed institutions. READ MORE:School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership fights national criticism It is also funded by the conservative Arizona State Legislature, although whether it continues to receive that funding is up in the air, as Gov. Katie Hobbs may attempt to remove its funding from being earmarked specifically for the school. If the earmarked funding is removed, the University will still receive that money, but will be allowed to allocate it wherever it chooses, which could still be toward SCETL. In fiscal year 2023, SCETL received a budget allocation of $5,804,100 and will have just over $9 million available in total. With all that money, the school only served 735 of the 142,616 students enrolled at ASU in Fall 2022. What a shame it would be if SCETL s funds weren t directed toward itsimportant societal contributions. If it didn t receive its funding, then it wouldn t be able to pay for a $200,000 copy of Adam Smith s Wealth of Nations or trips to Sedona and India! One can imagine the positive experience a student or professor who can barely afford housing must have when they flip open the dusty pages of Smith s writings. Yeah – it s shameful. More importantly, around the country, public education and marginalized people are under attack. Not only arebooks being banned in K-12 schools, but state legislatures are restricting colleges and K-12 schools from providing studies about gender and race. As a Black man, most of the books that I ve seen or heard of being banned always have to do with the Civil Rights Movement or something to do with slavery, and it s like, to me, I don t understand, why are you restricting knowledge? said Kendrick Adams, a junior studying criminology. The same legislatures and governors leading these attacks are also attacking the LGBTQ+ community, particularly transgender people. The Arizona State Legislature and the Koch brothers are no exception. The Legislature has repeatedly promoted anti-LGBTQ+ bills, and the Koch brothers have funded anti-LGBTQ+ institutions and politicians. So, how can one say that SCETL, a Koch-backed, Arizona State Legislature-funded institution deserves any legitimization from ASU? It doesn t, and to continue its existence at a University that claims to be defined by who it includes and not who it excludes, isn t just a contradiction; it s the not-so-tacit promotion of American conservatism and the hate it advances. Yet, there are institutions at ASU that promote diversity and progressive thought. TheSchool of Social Transformationand theSchool of International Letters and Culturesare each great examples. SCETL funding would be put toward the well-being of the ASU community if it was taken from SCETL and invested in the progressive and inclusive institutions that do exist at ASU. It s not an unimaginable thought, with Hobbs potentially creating an opportunity for the freedom school budgets to be spent elsewhere. ASU students and faculty should demand SCETL funding is moved to other institutions that actually promote the stated University values, and the University s leadership should support initiatives to remove earmarks for SCETL funding.

rice_thresher_2023_40,"ByKatie Kirkpatrick4/18/23 10:05pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. When prospective students apply to Rice, they undoubtedly value the academic rigor and research opportunities the university provides. However, many students ultimately choose Rice based on the assurance of a vibrant community and campus culture, where they can also pursue hobbies and interests outside of their university curriculum. As someone with a lifelong passion for dance, Rice Dance Theatre has filled this niche for me, allowing me to continue my dance education and nurture my artistic creativity as a member, leader, and now as outgoing president. This is true not only for me: RDT receives emails and direct messages from prospective students saying their college decision rests on available options to continue performing and learning dance. Unfortunately, growing constraints in space and resources have led RDT and other student performance groups to grapple among themselves for what Rice has available. Rice must increase the accessibility of practice and performance space and funding opportunities for all student performance groups that draw enthusiastic student interest on campus. RDT is one of the many student organizations that provide students with learning and performing opportunities not offered by official Rice programming. Through research for our 50th Anniversary this semester, we learned that Rice used to have a sponsored, funded dance program that offered dance classes and performance opportunities with designated dance faculty. Since this program’s termination in 2016, dance classes have decreased dramatically, and the dance performance scene has become entirely student-run and student-funded. Now, as a club sport, RDT continues to provide students with opportunities to take classes from local instructors, perform for their peers, and choreograph dances of assorted styles and difficulty levels. Outside of RDT, other dance club sports and student groups provide different types of dance experiences varying in style, commitment, and competition level. This year has been very successful for RDT. We had 36 members, doubling our numbers since we returned in person in Fall 2021. Our fall performance with BASYK received the largest attendance in recent RDT history. We expanded our style offerings beyond primarily contemporary and modern — including hip-hop, musical theater, and tap — and hired more professional instructors. Equally as important, we are incredibly proud of the sense of community and shared dedication that RDT has developed this year — the strongest since I joined in 2018 — undoubtedly partly because of our collective confidence in the quality of our performances. Going into next year, RDT is beginning to doubt the sustainability of this success and potentially that of other dance groups as well. The Recreation Center only has three multipurpose rooms large enough to hold practices, with only one having proper floor accommodations for certain types of dance. Scheduling performance events faces a similar issue, where finding a space large enough to safely hold performers and audience members has become increasingly challenging. Due to Rice’s lack of accommodating facilities, dance club sports and student performing groups inevitably fight for time in the same few spaces. If groups cannot reserve one of these spaces in time, they may resort to using other spaces that are less safe or less suitable for their needs, such as racquetball courts or PCF tents. Some facilities, such as Hamman Hall, even require rental payments, which many groups cannot afford. Due to the strain of finding available practice and performance spaces, groups may limit their operations and engagement with the campus community altogether. Thus, success for one group may come at the cost of success for others. Many students and Rice administrators alike have discussed the impacts of the pandemic and fully returning to campus after a two-year hiatus. Fortunately for Rice, there is no shortage of enthusiasm among the student body. Student groups are all working to bounce back from pandemic obstacles, attempting to revive and recreate their niches in campus culture. The increase in attendance to performance events this year, such as the Lunar New Year Gala that practically overtook the RMC, as well as the increase in performance group membership is evidence of these groups’ importance among students. However, it is disappointing that the main obstacle that some groups are facing is a lack of proper support from Rice itself. We cannot rest assured that the $100 million Moody grant and new student center proposal will create this support. As Rice’s student population continues to grow, so too will the enthusiasm for student performance groups. Rice must keep up with this demand if they truly want to support students’ attempts to reestablish a flourishing and enriching campus culture. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.

stanforddaily_2023_80,"On May 11, 2023, we proposed a resolution in the Faculty Senate requesting that the association of Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Mercer in all positions of responsibility or honor at Stanford University be terminated due to promulgation of dangerous, racist and antisemitic disinformation on platforms they own or control. The motivation for our resolution was first and foremost ethical. Although the Faculty Senate has no control over non-academic appointments and honors, members of the Stanford faculty do have an obligation to ensure that our University abides by its own code of conduct and other stated policies. TheUniversity Code of Conductstates that “All members of the University Community are responsible for sustaining the high ethical standards of this institution, and of the broader community in which we function. The University values integrity, diversity, respect, freedom of inquiry and expression, trust, honesty and fairness and strives to integrate these values into its education, research, health care and business practices.” It specifies that this Code applies to faculty, staff, students, postdoctoral scholars and members of the Board of Trustees, in addition to other individuals, including those who perform services for the University as volunteers. We believe that President Tessier-Lavigne’s statement in theStanford Reporton April 3, 2023, was made in that spirit: “Out in the broader world, we see too often the impact of misinformation, oversimplification and, especially, demonization in public discussions. Social media, cable news, and political discourse can be home to taunts, personal invective, and even the rule of the mob. We must collectively reject such corrosive conduct at Stanford.” Our primary concern is that the disinformation and hate speech promoted on platforms controlled by Murdoch and Mercer have violated the Code of Conduct and the clearly demarcated lines beyond which Stanford University’s president has promised action. Platforms owned and controlled by Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Mercer have been repeated purveyors of disinformation — false information deliberately spread with the intent to deceive people. This unethical practice is antithetical to the very purpose of our University. Murdoch’s Fox News spreaddisinformationabout the 2020 U.S. presidential election that stoked the fires that led to the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, then knowingly spreadliesabout that horrendous event. Mercer’s Parler platform spread similardisinformationand was also used toplanandexecutethe insurrection. Mercer’s Cambridge Analytica firm improperly obtained the private data of up to 87 million Facebook users and then according to awhistleblowerused these data toalterdemocratic elections in the United States and the United Kingdom via targeted disinformation. A major goal of this effort was tosuppressthe votes of Black Americans. In 2018, Cambridge Analytica declaredbankruptcy, leaving Facebook/Meta on the hook for a $725 millionlegal settlementfor user privacy violations involving Cambridge Analytica. Some have claimed that Murdoch and Mercer had no control over the content of their platforms. However, Murdochadmittedunder oath in theDominion lawsuitthat election claims made by Fox News hosts were false, and that he could have given orders not to allow certain kinds of content, or guests, on Fox News programs. “I could have. But I didn’t,” he said. Foxsettledthat lawsuit out of court for $787.5 million, reportedly to avoid further public disclosure of yet more damaging evidence against it. Following the January 6 insurrection, co-founder John Matze tried to stop domestic terrorists from using Mercer’s Parler platform; at this point, according toreporting, Mercer fired him. Platforms owned and controlled by Murdoch and Mercer have also promoted racial hatred and antisemitism. The “Great Replacement” theory repeatedly promoted byTucker Carlsonand others onFox Newswas directly cited by perpetrators of targeted mass murders of innocentBlacks,Jews,HispanicsandMuslimsin the US and New Zealand. Only a few years after the Tree of Life Synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh, PA, in which the perpetrator cited a centuries-oldtropethat powerful Jews act as puppeteers to control the world, Murdoch’sNY Postand Fox News social media displayed acartoonthat illustrated this antisemitic calumny. Very similar images were used by the Nazis inGermanyand incountries they occupiedto stoke the virulent antisemitism that fueled the Holocaust. Mercer’sBreitbarthas used the same antisemitic puppeteer conspiracy rhetoric. Furthermore, Mercer’s now defunct Parler platform was an internetrepositoryfor the spread of hateful racism and antisemitism. These practices stand in direct contradiction to astatementPresident Tessier-Lavigne made at Stanford Hillel on April 7, 2023, in response to yet another antisemitic incident on campus a few days earlier: “I want to make it very clear that we will not tolerate antisemitism and the symbols of antisemitism here on campus. It is something we need to eradicate.” His energetic response to this and other incidents of antisemitism on campus is laudable — our institution should have no tolerance for antisemitism and racism. When we introduced the resolution in the Senate, we emphasized our concern with the consistency of ethical positions upheld by the University. Referring to the motion about the Stanford University Honor Code that the Senate approved only two weeks earlier, we pointed out that we expect our students to be truthful and not to cheat on exams or misrepresent others’ work as their own. We expect the members of our faculty to be truthful and not knowingly publish false information. Therefore, we should expect persons in positions of responsibility and honor at Stanford to meet the same standards. However, the evidence cited above shows that having Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Mercer occupy such positions contradicts the Code of Conduct and President Tessier-Lavigne’s statements cited above. Murdoch and Mercer are currently members of the Board of Overseers of Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. Therefore, they should be subject to the same expectations of conduct as the faculty, staff, students, postdoctoral scholars, and members of the Board of Trustees. In our view, which issharedby many faculty members at Stanford, these individuals have repeatedly violated these expectations of conduct as detailed above. Therefore, we believe that their association with Stanford University in all positions of responsibility or honor should be terminated. Our resolution was not specifically directed at the Hoover Institution, as some have claimed. We would have the very same objections were these individuals to occupy positions on the Board of Trustees of Stanford University. Critics of our resolution on the Senate floor attempted to dislodge it from its proper context of ethics and present it as a question of academic freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of speech, and even freedom of the press. Regardingacademic freedom, Murdoch and Mercer are neither faculty members nor students. Rather, they currently occupy high non-academic positions within the University. As for freedom of speech, we would of course welcome them to speak at the University if invited. Our critics have characterized Murdoch’s and Mercer’s actions as “views” and “viewpoints,” and, against considerable evidence, claim they are not responsible for what is published in the media they control. We are not questioning their opinions; we are questioning their undermining of our University’s values by the disinformation in the media they own or support. Murdoch is free to publish in his news and broadcast media anything he wishes, and he does. We don’t object to that. We object to the University holding in a position of honor a person who had admitted, under oath, to have disseminated harmful disinformation for financial gain. How can we, as the University, implement the honor code in our undergraduate education while honoring someone who admitted to not doing anything to prevent dissemination of dangerous lies in the media he controls? Are we saying that a person’s ability to make donations or pay a steep legal settlement fee elevates them above all ethical standards? If so, what kind of message does that send to our students? How is it possible to simultaneously enforce and relativize basic ethical principles of conduct? Ethics is not a matter of opinions but of values. One builds one’s moral identity through membership and participation in a community. We need ethical consistency in pursuit of our two-pronged mission of research and teaching. Holding Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Mercer in positions of honor at the University disrupts that much-needed ethical agreement that forms the foundation of an institution. If the University is serious about its ambition to educate new generations of responsible citizens, it needs a clear ethical vision, to which all of us, faculty, students, administrators and, yes, board members, can subscribe. We introduced our resolution as “New Business” towards the end of the Senate meeting on May 11. Since it has not been voted on, the Senate rules stipulate that it must be brought back in one of its future meetings as “Unfinished Business.” We recognize that the Faculty Senate does not have the institutional authority to name or revoke members of advisory boards. It does, however, have moral authority to question these appointments. With this resolution, we invite each and every member of the Senate and the entire Stanford community to reflect on the ethical values they want to uphold at our University and to act on them.

state_press_2023_2,"Exterior of Brickyard Amuseum on Mill Avenue in Tempe on Sunday, Nov. 5, 2023. Rúla Búla will make itstriumphant returnto Tempe in the northern endzone of Mountain America Stadium for a week on Nov. 10. The week-long event will include memorabilia and the menu of the iconic Mill Avenue Irish pub, once a staple of Mill Avenue in downtown Tempe. This is a sign of the times that ASU s growing real estate influence, coupled with Tempe s changing infrastructure, is suffocating the once-bustling nightlife in the city. It is a deflating development as the University attempts to shift its perception from party school to theNo. 1Innovation Research Institution.Skyrocketing real estate costshave also pushed out classic college bars and hangouts across Tempe that once served a young and broke college population. The closings of Vine Tavern, College Bar and Grill and Rúla Búla have shown that the classic watering holes for students, alumni and other residents will soon be a thing of the past. For alumni like Jon Tarno, the scene has changed dramatically since he graduated from ASU in 2018. One word to describe it would be electric, as there would be lines and waits almost anywhere you went, Tarno said in a written statement. Comparing back then to now, the scene has completely changed and the overall environment doesn’t come close to what Mill Avenue used to be. The nightlife is different in Tempe now. Gone are the seedy college bars with cheap drinks and approachable vibes. In are the nightclubs like CASA and Varsity Tavern, the only two places mentioned in any plans on Mill Avenue on any given weekend night. With this change comes another loss, as the watering holes from the olden days were close to home football games, providing a space for students to bond. Joe Healey used to own College Bar and Grill located on the corner of College Avenue and Fifth Street, right across the street from Mountain America Stadium. Open from December 2017 to December 2019, he said it was a bar that wanted to attract a wide audience, including the obvious college-aged population. Proximity to things is huge, as far as you know a bar being there and a place that people want to go before and after games, Healey said. Obviously just the aesthetics of it are cool to people just hanging out. However, bars that depended on a college student population and the ability to pack the place were stripped of their entire clientele in 2020 withpandemic shutdowns. Combined with the rising costs of real estate in the area, it became difficult for the older, more established businesses to stay afloat, according to Healey. The loss of bars like Healey s isn t just a loss of physical space to drink and watch TV. The change deprives students of an important sense of community that remains years after they graduate and brings them to revisit their old haunts. I was at CASA last February on a Saturday afternoon while the Sun Devils were playing an important basketball game against UA in Tucson. The game was on the TVs, but no one was really watching. When Desmond Cambridge Jr. hit a full court buzzer beater to beat ASU s biggest rival and give the Sun Devils a boost into the NCAA tournament, the people at the bar – most pregaming for Innings Festival down the street – met the occasion with mild applause at best, a far cry from the electricity that used to characterize the area. Although it s a popular place, CASA lacks what College Bar and Grill was. Healey said he talks to people who do not know where to watch a road game in Tempe. I ve had people that I m involved in all these different ASU groups, and people are like, What s a good place to see a road game? I had somebody just ask me this past weekend. Like, I don t know, I literally don t know, Healey said. College Bar and Grillclosedin December 2019, after almost two years of operation. Healey said the bar was not retained in the building on College Avenue and Veterans Way because ownership changed hands, and they did not want a bar there. The building is now calledStudios 5cand was sold to University Realty in 2019. According to its website, University Realty receives, cultivates, advances and monetizes commercial and residential real estate to support the mission of Arizona State University. University Realty also owns Brickyard on Mill, a building on Mill Avenue with classrooms, offices and other establishments completed in 2002, and Mirabella, a senior housing facility that sued Shady Park, a bar and music venue on University Drive across the street, in 2021 over unnecessary and excessive noise at late-night hours. READ MORE:Judge sides with Mirabella and restricts Shady Park s concert noise, hours However, there are still exciting new places moving onto Mill s vibrant strip. Bang Bang Tempe will be an Asian fusion restaurant until late at night when it will become a nightclub. Hopefully, the new place brings a badly needed breath of fresh air to downtown Tempe. The city is changing, and with that the culture. I am of the firm belief that every college town is enhanced by the existence of a seedy bar with an insane deal on a weeknight, like the Vine Wednesdays of old. I think the campus community lost something special when Vine Wednesday went away. Edited by Mia Osmonbekov, Sadie Buggle and Angelina Steel.

state_press_2023_34,"A recently passed Senate Concurrent Resolution could prevent initiatives from showing up on Arizona ballots, even if there is support from a majority of the state. Senate Concurrent Resolution 1015 justpassed the Arizona Senateby a vote of 16-13-1 on Tuesday. If officially adopted by the House of Representatives and Governor Hobbs, the resolution would dramatically alter the existing ballot initiative landscape. SCR 1015 allegedly solves this embattled reality bydemanding 10% approval from each legislative district on initiatives, essentially making it impossible for Arizona citizens to put anything that could cause slight controversy on the ballot. It’s a muzzle meant to keep the legislature running the way it is without inviting or being informed by direct input from the people it serves. On paper, it’s a good faith effort to promote statewide buy-in on ballot measures. In reality, SCR 1015 is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, claiming to enhance democracy while stabbing it in the back. Currently,an initiativeneeds a number of signatures to equal 10% of the people who voted in the last governmental election in order to make it on the ballot. Under SCR 1015, introduced by Sen. J.D. Mesnard, R-Chandler, an initiative would need signatures from 10% of each legislative district rather than from the state as a whole. This means that if an initiative is unfavorably received in even one district, it won’t make it on the ballot. Although this arguably dilutes the power of larger districts, the origins of SCR 1015 are more political than practical. “Republicans and the people who support the Republican Party, the business groups, just don’t like what the voters are doing with the initiative,” said David Berman, a senior research fellow at theMorrison Institute for Public Policyat ASU. “You (now have to go through all the districts which greatly increases the workload.” Francesca Martin, a freshman studying political science, attests to this increased difficulty, having verified and gathered ballot measure signatures for over two years. “It discourages people from even trying to collect signatures,” Martin said. “Putting something on the ballot is (already a really difficult process, so I think my initial reaction is that (SCR 1015 really does thwart the democratic process.” Ballot initiatives also tend to conflict with business interests, such as proposing laws that increase minimum wage and taxes, progressive policies that students often vote for. “They (businesses don’t like having the state be anti-business, Berman said. “The idea is to slowly make it more difficult so that you wind up making the use of the initiative process one that can only be done by financed and organized organizations and makes it more difficult for a small group that wants to put something on the ballot.” This potential death of grassroots signature gathering is only one of the ramifications of SCR 1015. Martin also fears the bill’s geographic redistribution of power. “It is allowing one legislative district to dictate the rest of the state’s opinion,” Martin said. More cynically, SCR 1015 is a byproduct of politicians’ condescension toward direct input from voters. “The party that has the majority in the legislature doesn’t see any reason why anyone else should make laws,” Berman said. “They seem to think that it’s all right that the voters choose them and they make good judgments there, but (the voters can’t make good judgments on legislation.” This philosophical conflict about who should propose laws suddenly turns the humble initiative into a high-stakes power struggle between the elected body and its electors, especially when it comes tocontentious issues like school vouchers, which use taxpayer dollars to fund families private school tuition. “The legislature just doesn’t like to have voters vote on vouchers because they turn them down,” Berman said. “The teachers organize and reject anything the legislature does. (The legislature doesn’t really want to put it on the ballot because they’re going to lose.” Worse, SCR 1015 pays lip service to statewide buy-in while actually fracturing and undermining it. Arizona is a whole state, not warring factions. Being an Arizonan is what every Arizona resident has in common, transcending the arbitrary district lines that the legislature uses to divide us. 10% from a general election counts us all, while 10% from each district radically reduces our power to decide what our laws look like. Decreasing our agency is the first step in undermining our democracy, so make no mistake about SCR 1015’s real intentions. Edited by Kate Duffy, Jasmine Kabiri and Anusha Natarajan.

thetech_mit_2023_4,"The idea of smartphones being the cigarettes of this generation wasn’t a foreign concept to me. A few years ago, I read a passage in Cal Newport’s (PhD ’09 Digital Minimalismcomparing the goals of big tech companies to those of big tobacco companies. Despite seeing parallels between the two industries, I found the claim to be a bit of a stretch, even as someone very interested in the principles of digital minimalism. I was well aware of technology’s negative effects on society, but using a smartphone appeared much more innocuous than smoking. I realize now that I let the allure of my phone’s colorful and bright display deceive me. It wasn’t until a few months ago that I started noticing similarities between my smartphone behavior and smoking, at which point I no longer considered Newport’s comparison to be an exaggeration. This summer, I found myself bored in the lab quite often. Even though I had experiments and other lab procedures to complete, there was a lot of unscheduled time. As a result, I decided to check my phone once every hour or two at work. I prevented myself from breaking this rule by shutting down my phone after I checked each time so I would feel less inclined to pick up the phone. Each time I checked my phone, I made sure not to spend too much time because I was supposed to be focused on lab work and research. What I described above regarding my phone usage doesn’t sound too concerning. A few weeks into being in the lab, however, I started thinking about how my phone breaks were like the smoke breaks people took every hour. The thought of equating the two felt so perverted and disgusting to me. Yet gradually, the thought made more and more sense. The two behaviors seemed different on the surface, yet were similar psychologically. According to theAmerican Cancer Society, what makes smoking enjoyable is that nicotine affects brain chemistry by releasing a rush of dopamine as well as adrenaline. These effects last for a few minutes, and the temporary nature of this effect causes people to crave it again. My frequent urget to check my phone was a way of taking a break, it made me relax, and the behavior was rewarding because it distracted me from the unpleasant feelings of boredom, just as smokers enjoy having smoke breaks. Why couldn’t I just resist the urge and only check my phone when Ineededto instead of when Iwantedto during the workday? I thought that the growing awareness I had of phone breaks feeling like smoke breaks would force me to end this habit as soon as possible, but it wasn’t until a month ago that I finally took action to stop my smartphone habit from becoming more addictive and obsessive. I was annoyed that I had developed a habit of checking my phone much more than I wanted, especially email and messaging apps such as iMessage and Messenger. To add insult to the injury, my recent average screen time was around 30-50% higher than my average in the prior school year. Logically speaking, I knew that there wasn’t much point in checking my phone multiple times for a single new email or text when I could wait a few hours later. Despite this, I felt like my mind was under the control of my smartphone, a technology constantly hijacking my brain’s chemical machinery to make it release dopamine whenever I got a new message or email, just like smokers have higher levels of dopamine from inhaling smoke that has nicotine. Over time, the repetitive behaviors of checking my phone contributed to an obsession, which made it feel like a behavioral addiction. I detested how distracted I was: I couldn’t control myself from doing something that was mentally harming me. Instead, I let myself repeat the same actions day after day. My smartphone habit seemed just as addictive and hard to quit as smoking. What motivated me to end this habit was that I became so sick and tired of my obsession with checking my messages and email many times in a single day that I decided one day to limit the daily number of pickups to 10. While I could have used my daily screen time as a metric, I noticed that the average number of pickups would help the most because doing so would also help limit how much time I spent on my phone. My rationale for choosing 10 as the upper limit was that I am typically awake for 16 to 18 hours of the day, so picking up my phone at this frequency for purposes like looking up directions or checking text messages when necessary sounded like a reasonable number. After adhering to these limits for a few weeks, my screen time and pickups decreased substantially, which made me much happier because I felt like I finally had some agency over my mind. Nowadays, I can focus and concentrate better instead of fragmenting my attention by checking my phone. Of course, more progress must be made, but it is a good start. I must admit that it is uncomfortable to not look at the phone when waiting in line or sitting in the car, but I believe that choosing the harder path is ultimately more satisfying and rewarding than the easier one. Using smartphones is very different from smoking as one consists of using a handheld device while the other directly causes lung cancer and air pollution, but they are fundamentally not that distinct from a behavioral point of view. As stated previously, both habits drive addiction by affecting the brain’s release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that gives us pleasure. This addictive aspect is why website-blocking apps such as Freedom exist to limit our time on our phones. Ironically, it is by forcing ourselves to have less freedom to do what we want on our devices that we gain more freedom in the end. Not only that, both habits help us relax by letting us occupy ourselves with other activities. While it is obvious that smoking harms one’s physical health, the fact that smartphones have a detrimental impact on our brain’s ability to think can’t be ignored. Using a phone often is ordinary, but it ishurtingus in so many indirect ways: attention span, productivity, etc. In the long run, our cognitive abilities and mental health decline. Nowadays, we don’t even know how to embrace boredom. Boredom is an uncomfortable state to be in, so we turn to our phone as if it is a digital pacifier. Although it is comforting to turn to your phone whenever you’re bored, at the end of the day this tendency prevents us from performing deep work. A less apparent point is that smartphone usage, exactly like smoking, has harmful secondhand effects. One involves polluting the surroundings with harmful chemicals and carcinogens, while the other one is a more subtle form of pollution. The moment someone takes out their phone in a group setting, such as eating a meal with friends, something about the group dynamic and atmosphere changes. When one person looks at their phone, this indirectly influences others to follow suit either out of social awkwardness or boredom, causing the conversation to falter and social interactions to come to a pause. In other words, even the mere presence of a smartphone is distracting. Smartphones are the cigarettes of this era. By coming to terms with the fact that the underlying mechanisms of smartphone addiction are related to that of smoking addiction, we can take further steps to end this mental misery that has afflicted us for too long. Enough is enough. Vivian Hir is a junior majoring in Computer Science and Molecular Biology. Previously, she wrote an opinion article on The Tech about thenegative effects of social media."
crimson_2023_18,"Just three days ago, I published an articlerecognizing the vicious cycle of conflictin Israel and Palestine, and the bloodshed that it has wrought over the past 75 years. In light of the heart-wrenching and reprehensible killings ofover 1,300 Israeli civilians, I agreed with my classmates who firmly stated that “there is no justification” for such terrorism. I stood in solidarity with them, as I do now, as we mourned both Jewish and Palestinian lives lost. Yet in light of the recentsurge in Palestinian civilian killingsand thedestruction of Gaza, I cannot help but notice that the world has not yet come to believe that there is no justification for the slaughtering and forced removal of Palestinians, either. Late Thursday night, Israel Defense Forces liaison officers informed the United Nations of their order for an estimated 1.1 million Palestinians toevacuate northern Gazawithin 24 hours; warning leaflets were airdropped on the north Gaza strip on Friday. This decision to displace civilians from northern Gaza — a region already rendered inhospitable by a history of military blockades — to an overcrowded and overwhelmed southern Gaza will only exacerbate decades worth of displacement. The U.N. called upon Israel torevoke their order, emphasizing that such an evacuation would be “impossible” without “devastating humanitarian consequences.” I refuse to believe that a displacement of this magnitude is simply an ‘evacuation order’ when I hear an Israeli army veteran urge Israeli civiliansto kill their Arab neighbors, to “erase the memory of them,” to “erase them, their families, mothers and children.” When I see fleeing Gazans, who were complying with Israel’s order, getobliterated by an Israeli airstrikeanyways. When I hear Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declare, “Gaza won’t return to what it was before.We will eliminate everything.” The real victims of Israel’s retaliation are not Hamas militants. They are the more than 724 Palestinianchildren who havebeen killedin Gaza since last Saturday. They are the medical workersoperating on bleeding babiesas their hospitals are being missile-struck by the IDF. They are the fleeing Gazans — sons, daughters, mothers, and fathers — who are beingdecimated by Israeli rockets, both while trying to evacuate and evenafter reaching the ‘safe’ south. They are thejournalists who are being slainas they seek to make the world see, hear, and stop yet another Palestinian massacre. These actions evoke a long, tragic history of Palestinian displacement and destruction. I am reminded of the Nakba of 1948, when the Arab-Israeli War led to theexpulsion of approximately 750,000 Palestiniansfrom their homes. I am reminded of 1967, when more than 250,000 Palestinians fled the West Bank and Gaza during the Six-Day War. And I am reminded of the countless displacements since. These events come to my mind because, somewhere along the way, my great-grandfather’s family was among the millions displaced. And now, 75 years later, it is my aunt’s family who is evacuating northern Gaza, fleeing their homes and running for their lives. So, please, do not be fooled into thinking that this is just an Israeli incursion against Hamas. None of the2,215 Palestinian civiliansmassacred thus far are responsible for theterrorism we witnessedlast week. Their only crime was that they were born in a land that they could not fully claim, raised in a world that normalized their suffering. Their only mistake was that they lived in a region wheredecades of foreign interventionand disregard for human rights bred a minority extremism for which they all would be blamed. And because of these choices that they did not make, it will be them — innocent Palestinians — that suffer from Israel’s attacks on Gaza. In no way, shape, or form are Palestinians the only ones that have been killed this week, nor are they the only ones with a history of bloodshed. Yet today, thesignificant power imbalancefavoring the United States-backed Israeli government means that Israeli citizens inherently possess more protective measures, that their suffering will have a more defined end point. Even some impacted in Israel recognize that power disparity. Abrave Israeli survivorfrom the attack on Kibbutz Be’eri, Israel, explained that, “For me, it was over after 12 hours,” while “in Gaza, there are people for whom this event has not ended.” Historically, Palestinian death counts aredisproportionately higher, and their unlawful killings, forced evictions, and arbitrary detentionswill persistonce global headlines move on. I do not intend to sow division within our community during this fraught, heartbreaking time. The past week on campus has already been characterized by heightened anxiety, as evidenced by thedoxxing of pro-Palestinian activistsand students affiliated with such groups, who now face credible safety concerns. I myself feared writing this piece, and was advised not to by many people I trust. Butthe world is now looking at Harvardas a new generation grapples with an age-old conflict. Over the past week, I have mourned alongside my Jewish and Israeli peers, and I have heard, read, and respected their many perspectives. In writing today, my intent is nothing more than to share my own perspective of the bloodshed that Palestinians are now facing, and to place this destruction in the context of a long history of subjugation. If we truly seek to end this endless violence, we must affirm the humanity and experiences of Israelis and Palestinians alike. As countless more innocent Palestinians are slaughtered in the coming days, as their homes are obliterated yet again, their screams will reverberate among those of hundreds of thousands slain before them. I hope that the world will finally hear the harrowing echoes of their cries and realize that there is no justification.

In fact, the individual is an Israeli veteran. Correction: October 18, 2023 A previous version of this article stated that 70 Gazan civilians following Israel’s evacuation order were killed by an Israeli airstrike.

stanforddaily_2023_38,"When asked how life is going, or how Week insert a number is treating me, my standard response is, “oh, the usual, so busy.” To which the standard reply is: “I know right, same!” While the specific language might vary in each interaction, the overall theme stays the same: how freaking busy everyone is. But as those words escaped my mouth a few weeks ago, they startled me. Why had I said that? I wasn’t reallythatbusy. In fact, I was ashamed to admit it, but lately, I had hadfree time.The thought was so despicable that I tried to push it away immediately. I would never tell anyone that humiliating secret. Sitting in the back of CS106A during my freshman year, I couldn’t help but notice how few people were paying attention during class; rather, the sea of open laptops revealed that many people were actually doing something entirely unrelated to the lesson. Editing their resume. Updating their LinkedIn. Applying for an internship. Coding their own app (don’t ask me why these people are in CS106A to begin with . In other words, they were spending their time in class doing something far more productive than paying attention in class. And yes, I am guilty of being one of those people. At Stanford, there is a social pressure to be chronically busy; to constantly maximize the productivity of every second of every day. We are made to believe that if something doesn’t have a real-time benefit for our career, it is a waste of time. (We rationalize social interaction by the fact that many relationships with peers at Stanford will be “useful networking connections” one day. This article itself is the result of this: I was deliberating between settling down with a book and writing this article, and decided that this article would be a better use of time because it has a tangible outcome. This phenomenon can be characterized by a simple pattern: as Stanford students, we feel an overwhelming urge to constantly create things, or put things out into the world, rather than take in the knowledge the world has to offer. I should pause here and admit that this is an overgeneralization of the average Stanford student; there are also plenty of us who are passionate about learning simply for the sake of it. Yet when you scroll through Instagram and see someone posting about the start-up they founded, or the award they just received, or the talk they just gave, or them posing with the president because they just passed a bill through Congress, it’s hard to feel okay with just sitting back, relaxing, and doing something that doesn’t have an immediate outcome. Maybe that’s why, even though writing music is something I have done my entire life and is a form of therapy for me, I haven’t felt like I have had time to write a song in six months. But almost every work of genius or revolutionary idea emerged from hours, days, months, or even years of participating in an activity that is frankly the opposite of being busy:thinking. Isaac Newton got bored during quarantine in the time of the Great Plague and invented the theory of gravityandcalculus in one go. JK Rowling dreamt up the world of Harry Potter while she was bored on a 4-hour-long train, simply sitting and staring at the scenery outside the window. These people weren’t multitasking, but simply and truly just thinking. Many scientific studies have corroborated the notion that boredom leads to creativity: a2019 studypublished in the Academy of Management Discoveries asked some participants to complete a boring task, such as sorting a bowl of beans by color and asked others to complete a more engaging craft activity. Later, those who had been given the boring task outperformed the others on an intellectually challenging problem. Boredom puts us in a daydream-like state, and unlocks our creative potential by letting our imaginations roam freely without interruption or distraction. But in order to reach this state, you are probably not running 500 clubs, giving Ted Talks, or publishing a book at the age of 18. Frankly, you are doing nothing of note at all. Nothing worth posting about on Instagram, anyway. But life without constant stimulation became a foreign concept long ago. In fact, it’s difficult for me to recall the last time I felt completely bored — probably because when I have, I resolved that issue immediately by pulling out my phone. That’s what boredom has become — a problem to be solved. But I can faintly remember when boredom didn’t have such a negative connotation; being bored was exciting, a world full of endless possibilities. I remember being bored, pulling out a blank piece of paper and a pencil, and feeling a rush of exhilaration. What brand new thing was I about to create? As a student at Stanford, being bored feels shameful; a reason to apply for a few more internships or clubs. As we fill our calendars to the brim with activities that load up our LinkedIn profiles, I think that we should all learn to stop for a moment and embrace not being productive for a little bit. Learn from the world around us, instead of trying to convince the world to learn from us. While our LinkedIn might look blank for a while, maybe one day, it could say that we invented calculus. That would be pretty dope."
rice_thresher_2023_17,"ByThresher Editorial Board11/1/23 12:41am In the early hours of Oct. 29, the 50th Night of Decadence public at Wiess College was abruptly cut short. In an email to all students, the Wiess team in charge of organizing the public justified the shut down due to the complete overwhelming of Rice and Houston emergency services, which was promptly accelerated after an altercation between RUPD and several students. We thank the caregivers, Rice Emergency Medical Services, CJs and all others involved for doing everything they could to assist their fellow students and respond to this unexpected turn of events. But the escalation of the situation and the eventual need to shut down the public demonstrates an alarming shift in alcohol and party culture at Rice. While discussions including NOD talks, Critical Thinking in Sexuality and Orientation Week CJ talks are required across all residential colleges, other resources like alcohol counseling referrals are not offered equally. Though important, proactive talks are clearly not enough; resources must be offered to remedy behavior so that people drink safely at future parties. Restrictions on parties and hard alcohol, while a likely response to incidents like this year’s NOD, are not the solution either. We’ve seen time and time again that banning hard alcohol or alcohol-related gatherings will not stop people from drinking — but it could make them less likely to seek medical help. No student, especially one who needs assistance, should avoid REMS out of fear for their future at Rice. Part of rebuilding a culture of care at Rice means looking out for each other, whether that is dialing REMS when things get serious or keeping a friend who is too intoxicated from entering a public. But measures should be taken to keep this situation from happening in the first place. Count your drinks. Seek out support from peers or professionals to learn how to manage drinking habits. Learn your limits and stay within them when and if you choose to drink. NOD has demonstrated that our resources in the moment are finite, and we as responsible students need to change the way we approach alcohol to avoid overextending those resources again.

crimson_2023_9,"I’m not a pessimist. I don’t dwell on things that have gone wrong or might go wrong. I do my best not to be miserable in the face of, well, the state of the world. In fact, on occasion, I’ve been known to look forward to things with a sense of hope — wild, I know. But recently, as I have doomscrolled through my Twitter feed, watchingpoliticiansandcelebritiesalike sink to new lows and crying at the cancellation of a concert I was really looking forward to after theband broke up, my perspective has been colored somewhat differently. It seems,when something can go wrong, it most certainly will go wrong. If these past few pandemic years have taught me anything, it’s that maybe a healthy dose of pessimism is a good thing. In fact, being sensibly pessimistic is a wonderfully optimistic way to live your life. Hear me out. I come from the United Kingdom, a famously miserable place. You’d be hard pressed to find someone who doesn’t have a bone to pick with the government, their neighbor, or God himself for making the weather so consistently rubbish. Complaining and being generally grouchy is what we do. But one of our favorite national pastimes is making fun of the particular brand of west-coast, Hollywood-smiles, good-vibes-only optimism that has spawned a self-help revolution. Quite frankly, we were doing fine before we were told “You Are a Badass” or how to harness “The Power of Now” (yes, those are real books . While there is evidence that having a relentlessly optimistic outlook on life haspositive effectson happiness, it conjures a different image for me — namely, that of someone hanging a “Live, Laugh, Love” poster in their soft-walled cell as they laugh maniacally about how comfortable their straitjacket is. I just don’t get it. How grating must it be on one’s friends and family to hear nothing but glib platitudes while they go through incredibly tough times? Nothing is more infuriating than someone living in a fantasy land while those around them suffer; it’s like telling a depressed friend to just cheer up. Instead, perhaps counterintuitively, one of the healthiest things we can do is recognize that the world is absolutely falling apart right now. Ourdemocracy is in decline, civil rights are beingsystematically rolled back, and the climate disaster israging on— pick your favorite apocalypse. While thinking positively may be good for one’s health, it’s a matter of perspective: beaming as the world crumbles around you is borderline psychotic. Imagine, if you will, traveling back in time to meet your boomer relatives as children. They’d look at you like you had three heads if you so much as hinted at the state of the world you’d come from. It would be tough to convince them not to be pessimistic while you told them your wish for 2023 was for the world to finally shake the last vestiges of a deadly pandemic so you could stop carrying a spare mask around when trying to see a movie. That is, if the movie theater hadn’t been destroyed by aroutine freak weather event. And if thestaff all hadn’t quitbecause their boss refused to pay them a living wage. Oh, and if the production company hadn’tscrapped the entire moviefor cost reasons. Really takes the shine off the golden days, doesn’t it? Here’s where the optimistic part comes in, though. The pandemic changed how I make plans — contingency plans are a requirement on every holiday, last minute cancellations are no longer a surprise, and frankly, I’m surprised when any public transport or mail is on time anymore. I and many other optimistic pessimists set expectations very low, so as to be either prepared for the worst or pleasantly surprised by anything better. When you think about it, what could be a more optimistic outlook than that? Imagine every single thing in your life being either exactly what you expected, or a nice surprise. The most powerful good-vibes shaman in the world could only dream of a set of outcomes so favorable. This is not to say that I advocate for misery or detest hope. I firmly believe that we as a generation have the power to fix the problems we face, and to do so will require more than a little faith and belief in ourselves. It is also not to say one should not be resilient — one thing I’ve always admired about Americans is their ability to keep getting up with a smile, no matter how many times they’ve been knocked down. I just think it’s worth taking a look at the world before setting our expectations too high. Take the wins when they come, and don’t worry when it all goes wrong — because it will. Matt J.

In an email to fans selected to purchase tickets, Ticketmaster said, “In an effort to manage wait times for fans, all shows are assigned specific presale windows between the hours of 10 A.M. PT and 4 P.M. PT on Wednesday, April 5.” This system created more favorable experiences for fans, including myself, who wanted to purchase tickets. Similarly to a staggered system to purchase concert tickets, a staggered system could be an approach Stanford takes for class enrollment in the future. Notably, a staggered class enrollment system is a concept that has been introduced previously by many institutions. At the University of California, Los Angeles, students haveseparate enrollment times, where students with the most units receive priority. In this case, upperclassmen would have first access to enroll in classes. Similarly, Yale University recently introduced astaggeredclass enrollment process for the Spring of 2023 semester, where seniors have priority. However, even before this staggered enrollment process, an overwhelmed server was neveran issue, but rather other transparency issues. Although staggered enrollment appears to be a viable option, it is difficult to imagine that Stanford has the capacity for it as during Autumn quarter, frosh still had issues enrolling. However, it could be a step in the right direction in an attempt to ease the enrollment process. Though, a staggered enrollment might not be favorable for much of the student body. To offset this, enrollment caps can be enforced, so with every group of students that enroll, a portion of seats can be available for every period. Stanford could approach a new system in many ways, but some may be more promising than others. Whichever direction Stanford takes, it should be one that improves the effectiveness of SimpleEnroll, because the experience students have had in the past has been extremely disappointing. This past Autumn quarter was my first quarter at Stanford and, thus, my first time having to enroll in classes. As a part of the Frosh “Approaching Stanford” and “New Student Orientation” (NSO experience, none of the incoming students were able to enroll in classes until the end of these programs. What I took away from my first time enrolling in classes is that it is pretty ironic that Stanford, one of the leading institutions in computer science, has not been able to configure an adequate class enrollment system. On Sept. 22, 2022, Frosh had a mandatory “Designing Your First Quarter” Zoom event at 1 p.m. to help us choose our classes. However, we were also warned of the high probability that Axess would crash, and we should not freak out over not being able to enroll in classes immediately. Once this event concluded at 2 p.m., our enrollment hold was lifted, and we could finally enroll in classes. Except, an overwhelmed Axess barred us from enrolling. When the clock hit 2 p.m., Axess was not loading for me, my roommate or anyone in my all-frosh dorm. We kept getting error messages and had no luck enrolling. We only saw a blank page that failed to load for the next hour and a half. At 3:30 p.m., we had to attend a “President’s Reception and Class Photo Event.” Many frosh hesitantly participated because we could still not enroll in classes. At around 5 p.m., Axess was back up and running, and frosh could finally enroll in classes after about a three-hour delay. It is safe to say it was not the most pleasant “first time enrolling in classes” experience. With the introduction of SimpleEnroll for Winter quarter enrollment, I was hesitant to believe it would be a better enrollment experience. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the new site was only down for a few minutes when enrollment opened, and I could enroll within a few minutes. It was a much better experience than in the Autumn and a significant improvement. For Spring quarter enrollment, Stanford introduced the “Batch Enroll” feature. Following the improvement during Winter quarter, I expected this enrollment to go pretty smoothly, especially with how positively Stanford promoted the new feature. Batch Enroll was touted as a “two-minute” process during peak enrollment time and an easier way to enroll in classes with the “push of a button.” However, Spring enrollment demonstrated this seemingly smooth feature was not what it seemed. Adding this feature for Spring enrollment created aneven longer processthan Winter quarter. Many students received error messages on the site and had trouble loading SimpleEnroll. Although I could get into all of the classes I had planned, I couldn’t finish enrolling until 30 minutes after SimpleEnroll opened. The delay during Spring enrollment was disappointing as it was a setback from a more straightforward enrollment process students faced during the Winter. In response to Spring enrollment,Stanford statedthat it is pursuing alternate options for enrollment management. While I had heard from RAs, upperclassmen and University staff that enrollment was typically a complicated process, I never expected it to be as frustrating, especially compared to other institutions. Fixing SimpleEnroll will not change the number of students who can enroll in a class or reduce the chances of being waitlisted. Still, it would make it a simpler enrollment process that does not include hours of endless refreshing and annoyance. With a recent disappointing enrollment process and the University asking students forfeedback, it is unclear if Stanford will pursue a different enrollment process in Autumn quarter. Regardless of what the University decides to pursue, it should prioritize an effective enrollment process that involves collaborative decision-making with the student body. This is simply an idea that Stanford could consider to improve the enrollment process for students. However, the main takeaway is that Stanford needs to prioritize an adequate enrollment system that involves the student body’s opinions. There may never be a perfect system; however, if Stanford listens to student voices and implements this feedback into an efficient system, the institution could inch closer to a better student experience.

wildcat_arizona_2023_0,"Olivia Malone Old Main was the first building constructed on the University of Arizona campus in Tucson, Arizona. It served as the school itself, with classrooms, dorms and more until the campus expanded. Old Main remains today, now full of offices. Olivia MaloneApril 23, 2023 With my freshman year at the University of Arizona coming to an end, I think the best thing this campus could be compared to is a vivarium. A quickGoogle searchwill define a vivarium as “anenclosure, container, or structure adapted or prepared for keeping animals under semi-natural conditions for observation or study.” I would like to place an emphasis on the wordsemi-natural. From my experience, a college is a place of newfound independence for most. Many of us are living on our own or with someone new. We are in charge of our diets, expenses and basically every moment of our time. It is said to be our first bit of time in the “real world.” All of these things were to be expected, though it made them no less jarring. I watched myself and others struggle to learn how to pick a properly priced container of fruit, fix a broken light, deal with an intoxicated friend and learn our limits. Within my first month at the UA, I was perplexed by the politics of Greek Life, the frequency of parties and other aspects of a college town that make our time here so unique from living off of a college campus. We are in our vivarium, a place that is as close to the real world as possible, but because of its unique purpose, placement and population, is subject to a degree of uniqueness. Aside from settling into my newfound independence and struggling with the tribulations of grocery shopping, I learned that although the UA feels like an island at times, it is not exempt from what is going on in the rest of the world. One of the most difficult events in the UA community from this year was the killing of professor Thomas Meixner. The head of the Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences Department was shot on campus last semester, and a former graduate student is charged with the murder. According to theGun Violence Archive, 5,778 people have been killed in gun violence in 2023 as of April 27. The fact that it happened on our campus is shocking, but not necessarily unpredictable. I remember walking back from a lecture on gender and contemporary society and receiving the UAlert on my phone that a shooting had occurred. A cloud hung over campus for a few days, and then life moved on. This was something I did not expect to happen in my vivarium, but upon thinking about it just a little more, I suppose I should have. We were also faced with grotesque anti-abortion protests on the UA Mall, moving counter-protests and the repeated presence of an old man on the Mall banishing all queer people, Jewish people, etc. to hell because of who they are, sometimes just yards away from campus tours for potential new students. Essentially, my freshman year consisted of a repeated cycle of feeling settled into a sort of utopia where I had menial adult responsibilities and lots of school work, and then being thrown back into reality by events I am used to seeing in the news. As my freshman year progressed, I would find myself at times feeling more jaded. Throughout the year, I saw more and more of the things my adult parents told me I would experience in the real world, and each time I did, more of the cynicism I resent in adults began to come out in me. I knew this was not an isolated experience either. One thing the semi-natural environment of the college vivarium gave me was a sense of community. We are all around the same age, all in a new environment. Most of us are fresh on our own, and many of us are still figuring things out. These shared traits are something I have gained great gratitude for. As I see myself getting frustrated over an Urgent Care bill for my fifth cold or flu of the year, or feeling depressed when twisted events or people are present on my campus, I know I can turn to nearly whoever is right next to me and they will be able to empathize, whether we agree on certain things or not. I entered the UA prepared for either a utopian land of parties or a hard taste of the real world, and, in the end, I got both. The UA is not exempt from dealing with serious problems that plague our society, but in the same way, the student body is able to help each other and in that way, they can help the world. We are not as tired as our parents just yet, which I know because I have seen fiery counter-protests, passionate clubs and eager-to-learn minds in every corner of campus. The vivarium is a unique place for our minds to grow, and I am leaving this year thankful for the semi-natural nature of the UA’s vivarium because it is nurturing passionate students who are becoming tired of society’s faults.

crimson_2023_2,"“How come you never speak Spanish?” Usually, I only tell people half the story: My parents just never taught me. Usually, I hide the fact that I’ve been slowly learning Spanish on my own time, too embarrassed about my poor Spanish to actually practice it. But nobody wants to hear that — they’d rather tell me I’m agringado or a “no sabo kid” or “not a real Mexican.” As far as I could tell, I was “a real Mexican” when I had to explain that I didn’t “get in because of my last name” ten minutes after receiving my Harvard acceptance. As far as I could tell, I was “a real Mexican” when I was unable to shake theanxiety of Uvaldein the crowd at Carnaval in San Francisco last May. And as far as I could tell, I was “a real Mexican” when I felt relieved to learn that my dad had been too sick to go to the Gilroy Garlic Festival as he had planned. After all, theracist mass shooterwould have targeted someone who looked like him. The truth is, I’m not alone — many Latines find that their language skills place them in a liminal space where they are “not quite Latine enough” for their own community, yet just Latine enough to be on the receiving end of racial hostility. However, this categorization overlooks the fact that countlessLatines like medon’t speak Spanish for the most Latine reason possible: forced assimilation. The idea of conflating Latinidad with language is hardly a new one: The term Hispanic as understood today was coined by the United States Census Bureau; around the same time, the 1976Public Law 94-311defined this population for census data collection as those who “identify themselves as being of Spanish-speaking background and trace their origin or descent from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central and South America, and other Spanish-speaking countries.” No matter how prevalent it may become, “Hispanic” will always be a conceptually bankrupt term to me. Because “Hispanic” attempts to group people together solely based on the use of the Spanish language, it excludes people from Brazil, Haiti, and Belize, while including those from the country responsible for the colonization of most of Latin America: Spain. Clearly, this is a problem — it implies that there is no difference in the privileges of Spanish people and the people belonging to the countries Spain oppressed and stole from for centuries. This is hardly a necessary evil; other definitions of Latinidad find unity in a combination of cultural identity, national origin in South and Central America or the Caribbean, colonial legacies, and lived experience against the backdrop of American society. In doing so, we can avoid lazily grouping the colonizer and the colonized together on the basis of a language Spaniards forced on Native Americans. Even still, language is what connects us to our music, to our classmates, and even to our own families. It’s not hard to understand how Latines that were never taught to speak the language that defines their community (be it Spanish, Haitian Creole, or Quechua might develop a cultural disconnect within their own communities, or even a sense of inadequacy. However, this is no excuse for portraying “no sabo kids” as “not Latine” — the reality is, Latines aren’t choosing to leave their native language behind. No, Latine languages aren’t being lost because their speakers are “lazy” or “want to be white.” Rather, we lose our languages when our speakers are criminalized for speaking their native language in the fundamentally Latine experience of forced assimilation. While we might not want to define the Latine experience around the loss of language, the same could be said about our colonial history or labor exploitation — unfortunately, what it means to be Latine cannot so easily be disentangled from our community’s generational trauma. Much like our colonial history under European and North American forces, the United States government bears responsibility for much of this trauma: The erasure of the Spanish language can be traced back to a long history of forced assimilation, or “Americanization of Latines, exemplified by school segregation in Texas and California. By 1931, 80 percent of school districts in Texas and California officially segregated Mexican children, sending them to schools deliberatelydesigned to assimilate and exploittheir students, training them for industrial, agricultural, and housekeeping work while neglecting to teach them basic reading and writing. Students at one such school in Texas evenreported being beatenshould they dare speak Spanish. Despite this form of segregation being struck down in Mendez v. Westminster, the death of Mexican American schools left a loophole for future segregation: linguistic segregation. As a result, in Arizona today, the de facto segregation of Spanish-speaking students is enforced, all while students are only allowed to be taught in English. With 70 percent of the United States under the impression that it is very important to speak English to be “truly American,” it’s clear that this forced assimilation isn’t going to end anytime soon — suggesting continued massive impacts on Latines. When so much of the country sees speaking Spanish as “un-American” and random Latines areyelled atfor using their native language, it should come as no surprise that many parents decide not to teach their children to speak Spanish. The resulting “no sabo kids” certainly deserve Latinidad; we lost our language as a result of forced assimilation — a key part of the Latine experience. Even still, many “no sabo kids” find hope in language reclamation. Notably,SelenaandJulián Castrohave chosen this path themselves, effectively acknowledging that, while much is lost with our language, much can be regained by learning that same language, even decades into your life. While the harm of forced assimilation cannot be overlooked or forgotten, language reclamation represents a path forward. It offers us a place to call home and the opportunity to replace a missed connection with a new relationship. Joseph W.

stanforddaily_2023_33,"In a survey of the Stanford student body conducted in 2020 by Mila Camargo ’22 M.A. ’23, 92.1% of students** said they would modify their body (i.e. lose weight, gain muscle or change the size/shape of specific body parts if they could. In that same survey, 67.7% of participants indicated that Stanford culture exerts pressure to look a certain way. While most would not recognize these issues from the outside, as president ofStudents Against Eating Disorders (SAED , a club dedicated to promoting healthy relationships with food and our bodies, I have witnessed firsthand the prevalence of disordered eating and its toll on Stanford students. So many of us are suffering silently due to stigma and the misconception that we are alone in this challenge. Over 100 participants have signed up for our peer-led support groups since the program’s start at the beginning of last school year. More and more students come to us reporting negativity in their relationship with food, their bodies and themselves. Because I struggled with an eating disorder throughout high school and college, I thought I already understood the heavy burden eating disorders pose. But each week, when I facilitate the support group, I am consistently struck by how much students are impacted by these all-consuming disorders, often triggered by diet culture comments from their peers, stressful life events, academics and challenges with other mental health issues. The prevalence and impact of eating disorders at Stanford shouldn’t be a surprise. Some factors in college canincreasestudents’ susceptibility to eating disorders, from navigating dining halls with so many options to living in an unstructured environment away from parents and families for the first time. This challenge likely contributes to the fact that eating disorders typicallybeginbetween 18 and 21 years of age, and between 10 and 20% of women and 4 to 10% of men in collegesufferfrom one of these disorders. Rates are also on the rise in light of the pandemic, with researchdemonstratingsubstantial increases since the start of the pandemic for overall incidence (15% , hospital admissions (48% and emergency department visits (11% . At Stanford, community members often talk about the infamous “Duck Syndrome,” in which students hide their struggles. With that comes the pressure to seem happy and healthy, not just academically, but holistically. “Wellness” fads such asintermittent fastingandketogenic dietshavebecomemore popular among college students. At the same time, students I have talked to are feeling pressure to restrict calories or engage in other disordered behaviors, such as purging or compulsive exercise, in order to control their shape or weight. “The impact of disordered habits on campus is really hard to quantify,” Sarika Lansberg ’25 said. “One example is that gym culture can be toxic on campus, with people spending all of their time working out to an unhealthy extent.” The severity of this issue cannot be understated. Eating disorders have thehighestmortality rate of any psychiatric diagnosis. 20% of peoplesufferingfrom anorexia will prematurely die from complications related to their eating disorder, including suicide and heart problems, and another large portion will unfortunately never fully recover. This is also a challenge that impacts a multitude of intersectional identities. There’s a common misconception that these illnesses only impact middle-to-upper-class cisgender white adolescent girls, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Men also struggle with eating disorders, which often go unaddressed due to stereotypes and stigma. And clinicians may beless likelyto adequately recognize eating disorder symptoms, make a diagnosis and prescribe appropriate treatments for ethnic minority communities. A 2020 study also found that LGBT adults and adolescents experiencegreater incidencesof eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors than their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. Despite these significant challenges and their prevalence, Vaden Health Center at Stanford only has one licensed therapist at their counseling center,Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS , that specializes in eating disorders. Eating disorder care teams are usually multidisciplinary, consisting of a primary care physician, a therapist and a nutritionist. And while there are valuable resources available at Vaden Well-Being in the form of nutritionists and well-being coaches, there’s a current lack of awareness and conversations about these resources and how we can bolster and promote them. The barriers to accessing care are thus twofold: there are limited resources, and there is a lack of discourse around eating disorders and a stigma associated with seeking care, which may lead to reluctance to ask for help. That’s why strengthening support for students who may be struggling with eating concerns is paramount, from both a cultural lens and an administrative perspective. This is an issue that deserves — and quite frankly, needs — more attention from Stanford’s administration, student leaders and everyone on campus. Students Against Eating Disorders has trained ResEd staff, including resident assistants and fellows, on what eating disorders can look and feel like and how staff can appropriately respond to a student voicing or demonstrating concerns with eating and body image. We’ve also put on panels, conducted social media outreach and tabled to spread awareness. While doing this work is immensely rewarding, addressing this crisis requires far more resources than what one student group can provide. Stanford needs to increase resources for addressing eating and body image concerns, which should look like hiring additional counselors that specialize in eating disorders to meet the needs of all of its students and funding initiatives that aim to prevent and respond to eating disorders. And we as students need to spread awareness about the prevalence and dangers of these issues, support those who may be experiencing disordered behaviors and be conscious of the language that we use. Eating disorders are unfortunately competitive, in that sufferers are constantly trying to be the “sickest,” so talking about diets and calories or fat shaming others can have a longstanding and immense impact on someone who might be vulnerable. According to Elias Applebaum ’25, who has recovered from anorexia nervosa, one way that we can promote a culture of wellness is through “holding each other accountable and having constructive conversations.” “We need to be supportive without enabling people to hurt themselves,” Applebaum said. He especially stressed the importance of destigmatizing conversations around disordered eating for men. “We need to be able to look at the ways we endorse hypermasculinity for men, and the ways that this promotes disordered eating,” Applebaum added. If we take a stand together, perhaps we can work towards a Stanford where the number of students who want to change their bodies goes significantly down from 92%. Until then, many students will continue to struggle in silence. **Note: The results of this survey data are disaggregated and the survey has not been linked in order to preserve the privacy of individual participants.

crimson_2023_100,"I started acting when I was eight. It was, in many ways, the defining moment of my life. I discovered something that I was deeply passionate about, which I’d dedicate a good deal of my life to. Acting was a tool for dealing with strong, percussive emotions, and for understanding myself and the world around me. The prospect of being able to explore disciplines like Philosophy, Government, and History while still participating in the arts and growing as an artist attracted me to a liberal arts education. But when I arrived at Harvard, known for its exceptional opportunities in the liberal arts, I was shocked by the lack of attention paid to the ‘arts’ part of that curriculum. In the study of what it means to be human, we’ve forgotten perhaps its most defining characteristic: the propensity for creativity. To receive a degree signifying completion of a liberal arts education at Harvard, students are never required to write a story, perform on stage, or pick up an instrument. Students who do participate in the arts often confine their creative talents to extracurricular activities, which are largely viewed not as educational opportunities, but as outlets for those who are already proficient. Instead, all students should be required to take a creative arts class. I know. It’s a tall ask. But I think it’s foundationally important. Performance is highly personal, and affects your mind in a way meaningfully distinct from analysis. It’s a crucial tool to help understand both yourself and the art that you’re performing. When I was in high school, I spent three weeks hastily memorizing, rehearsing, and performing “Hamlet.” It was all-consuming; I was thinking about the prince almost every minute of every day. That forced interrogation gave me a much deeper understanding and appreciation of Shakespeare’s words in a way that nothing else could ever have. Nothing makes you understand Hamlet’s emotional turmoil in his“To be, or not to be” monologuemore than being dead tired running over the same tragic scenes over and over, forcing yourself to be visibly miserable, staining your clothes with sweat and tears. More than that, performing gave me a deeper understanding of myself. It helped me understand my own struggles with depression and hopelessness. It forced me to interrogate parts of myself I would rather forget about: the parts of myself that found catharsis in Hamlet’s screaming and mentally ill ramblings. It gave me a deeper, more nuanced view of the complex world that I live in. And that enveloping experience is not unique to me. It’s the same kind of experience my friend Veronica F. Leahy ’23 had while writing and performing her senior thesis, “American Tonic.” Her concert, in my view, was as much an anthropological project as a musical showcase, trying to document what it means to live with Type 1 diabetes. Seeped in the language of jazz, Leahy wrote music that was often harsh, uncomfortable, and angry, yet interlaced with joy and hope. Interspersed were interviews with figures such as activists, peers, and childhood friends. The performance seemed more than just an attempt to document, but an attempt to understand the disease that’s plagued her for most of her life. Writing and performing, for Leahy, helped her understand herself as much as it helped others understand the experience of living with chronic illness. But art is often extremely difficult, reliant on years and years of experience. That’s one frequent criticism of requiring participation in the arts. Many students may feel as though they’re not suited to performance, and that a lack of innate ‘talent’ and the many years of dedicated practice required to improve would cause any art classes they take to hurt their GPA, stopping them from getting anything meaningful out of the experience. These arguments are well taken. Art is difficult. But the goal of the liberal arts is to push you out of your comfort zone. This kind of education is supposed to be hard, and you should be exploring things you’ve never done and may never do again. It’s also supposed to force you to do things you may not intrinsically want to — that’s the whole point of the liberal arts. It’s what makes education special. Harvard prides itself on liberal arts, but has let a key aspect of that mission slip through their fingers. The College, as part of their divisional distribution requirements, should separate the Arts and Humanities, forcing students to take at least one of each. The new distributional Arts courses should be focused on creative writing, acting, musical composition, musical performance, physical art, and design, offering students a broad range of options given their areas of interest. This will allow students to be as invested as possible, and make it so every student is creating something in a field they find at least somewhat enjoyable. This gives them the autonomy to choose their own paths through the arts, while ensuring that they aren’t missing out on that foundational part of their education. Creativity is a fundamental part of being, and a crucial tool in understanding art, self, and environment. It’s ridiculous that Harvard almost entirely ignores it. As Shakespeare wrote, “All the world’s a stage.” It’s about time we treated it like one. Vander O. B. Ritchie ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Matthews Hall."
crimson_2023_44,"A forceful op-ed in defense of linking groups is likely to be met with apathy. It’s not obvious, I’ll admit, that we should care aboutHarvard’s quiet decisionto remove the option to link with another blocking group from the housing lottery process. After all, upperclassmen already have their linkmates. The next batch of sophomores will simply have a different — not necessarily worse — lottery experience. I want to offer two perspectives: the forceful defense of linking you might not have considered and the reason Harvard’s decision is worth talking about, even if you don’t care about linking groups. The reason I value linking groups so highly isn’t that they’re essential to every student’s experience — it’s that my linking group has been essential to mine. And no one should be deprived of that opportunity without a much better justification than Harvard has offered. Many students find living in the Quad isolating — I’ve heard some people even transfer to River Houses — but I haven’t. I’ve been surrounded by 13 of my closest friends the entire time, essentially guaranteeing a rich social web around the Quad that leaves little to be desired in my “home” life. My linking group is only roughly half of this web, but I can’t imagine how different my college years would have looked without it. I doubt most people assign the same personal importance to linking. It’s true that students will form close friendships in the absence of linking groups, and our social circles evolve as we meet new people throughout college. But especially for Quad residents, the opportunity to start off one’s upperclassman years alongside a large group of friends can be indispensable. Admittedly, lottery groups are only a best guess about our future social lives. But the ability to make this guess is one of the greatest features of Harvard’s housing system, one that’s allowed some of my closest friendships to form and flourish. Arbitrarily halving the ceiling on the size of that group may not be bad for most, but it doesn’t seem very good for anyone, either — linking has always been an option, not a mandate. I characterized Harvard’s decision as arbitrary, but the truth is that we are left to speculate about the soundness of its reasoning. Harvard has largely declined to articulate why it abolished linking, hiding instead behind generic references to a growing student population and creating a more “fair and equitable” housing system. I struggle to grasp how limiting student autonomy in an already randomized housing system advances fairness or equity. I could attempt to guess Harvard’s underlying worries — perhaps it’s concerned about increasing the flexibility of the housing system — but without further explanation, it requires a feat of mental gymnastics to understand why, after almost two decades, there’s any reason to change it now. The opaque rationale the administration has offered is simply a deficient justification for a meaningful change in student life. Whether or not linking has been important to our Harvard experience, we should demand a higher standard from the people who govern us at school. The administration should explain why a growing student population makes it infeasible to sort the same number of students across the Houses in larger units. And it should tell us clearly how limiting students to the guarantee of living near seven of their friends, instead of 15, advances fairness and equity. Harvard hasn’t endeavored to convince us of any of this — it’s taken our apathy and inattention for granted. But vacuous word salad can’t do the work of justification, on this or on any other issue. Letting students link is important — undoubtedly more for some than for others. But it’s also important to raise the low bar for transparency to which Harvard seems to hold itself. If linking must go, let’s let the notion that we’re apathetic go with it. Lucas T. Gazianis ’24, an Associate Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Currier House."
stanforddaily_2023_64,"Shabbat this past Saturday, Oct. 7, marked the holiday of Simchat Torah, a joyous day on which Jews complete our yearly reading of the Torah and begin the sacred cycle of reading our holy book anew. However, this year, Jews who were looking forward to celebrating in the holiday’s festivities awoke to the devastating news of a surprise attack and a declaration of war. Heartbreaking images and videos have streamed our Israel since Hamas began its attack. As of Wednesday, Oct. 11, Hamas, in pursuance of its explicitlygenocidal agendaagainst the Jewish people, haslaunchedover 5,000 rockets into Israel and sent its armed fighters across the border for the purpose of slaughtering civilians. Hamasrejectsany distinction between Israeli civilians and soldiers. They havemurderedover 1,300 innocents (including22 Americans and injured at least 3,300 more. At a holiday music festival turned bloodbath, where Hamascut down260 young people alone, a current Stanford student’s family member was amongst the many lost. In its wake, Hamasperpetratedthe mass rape of Jewish women beside the bodies of their slaughtered friends. They havetakenover one hundred and fifty hostages — including both theyoung and the elderly, as well as citizens of countries including theUnited States,Canada,Mexico,Thailandand more — whose loved ones fear they will never see them again. Theyreducedhomes in Tel Aviv to rubble. These terrorist attacks are unacceptable. Hamas’ violence hasunleashedthe bloodiest conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in nearly fifty years, and their blatant transgression of legal and moral norms shocks the conscience. The Jewish people have been persecuted for 3,000 years. Hamas’ actions this Saturdaymadeit the bloodiest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust. Never again is now. Like most Jews, I support Palestinians’ aspirations for justice and independence. However, that future will not come under the banner of Hamas — adesignated terrorist organizationwith a long history oftorturingand killing not only Jews but Palestineans (evenincludingone of their own top commanders for alleged homosexuality . While recognizing the legitimate grievances of the Palestinian people, terrorism and war crimes cannot be condoned under any flag or cause. International law offers no sanction for Hamas’ brutal actions — which, in fact, are flagrantly illegal violations. Hostage-taking, attacks intentionally targeting civilians and rape are clearly proscribed under all circumstances during armed conflicts underArticle III of the Fourth Geneva Convention(common article III of the 1949 Geneva Conventions ,customary international law on rapeandArticle VIII of the Rome Convention, to which Palestine is a signatory. There is nothing to celebrate in a mass slaughter of Jews. Hamas knows well that its action will bring Palestinians no closer toward achieving their legitimate claim to self-determination, but will instead tragically set that goal on a backward trajectory at the cost of innocent lives. Hamas’ pursuit of genocide against the Jewish people has come at the expense of the Palestinian people, who have been their primary victims. As Hamas makes clear in its own words inArticle 13of its Covenant, it will never, ever make peace. To free Palestine requires freeing Palestinians from Hamas. Its radical tyranny over Gaza must end. As distressing as it already is to process the trauma of a modern-day pogrom and grapple with fear for our loved ones in Israel that is keeping many of us awake at night, it is doubly devastating to do so while also processing the extent to which many around the world and in our own community are desensitized to Jewish bloodshed, with some evencelebratingit. Even as we worry about Jews in Israel, Jews around the world are now being forced to question their own safety where they live. The palpable threat of a former Hamas leader’scallfor a global ‘Day of Rage’ on Friday, Oct. 13, has led to synagogue and schoolclosuresand demanded an urgentincreasein security for Jewish institutions facing targeting. In Britain alone, reports of antisemitic incidents haveshot up300% since the war broke out. On the steps of the Sydney Opera House, protestorschanted“gas the Jews.” In Alexandria, Egypt, a police officer shot andkilledtwo Jewish tourists along with their Egyptian guide. FromUtahtoChicago, U.S. synagogues have faced a flood of bomb threats. American universities too have been the scene of mounting antisemitism since Hamas’ attack. For example, on Wednesday, an Israeli student at Columbia University wasbeatenwith a stick in front of the library while putting up posters with the names and photos of Hamas’ hostages. Unfortunately, Stanford has been no exception to the devastating trend. Too many students here have posted on social media sites such as Fizz and Instagram, justifying Hamas’ mass murder. As many students feared loved ones being burned alive while watching Israeli homes and towns set alight by Hamas rocket fire, a banner washungat Tresidder Union emblazoned with the words “The Illusion of Israel is Burning.” The word choice felt like a calculated attempt to exploit that fear and trauma — as it reminded many Jewish students of the image of the mass burning of Jews during the Holocaust, a scene which Hamas is now replicating. Students biking to class past White Plaza on Wednesday morning were subject to the cruel taunts of chalkings with messages lauding violence against Jews, including “Viva Intifada” (which refers to two historical episodes of terrorist violence that claimed thousands of Israeli lives and “Israel is Dead.” Jewish first-years eager to learn in their required “Civil, Liberal and Global Education” class were singled out andharassedby their instructor based on their identity in a disgraceful public shaming. The instructor, who has since been suspended, asked Jewish students to identify themselves and then separated them from their belongings, claiming that this was what Jews were doing to Palestinians. According to what students in touch with the targeted first-years told the San Francisco Chronicle, after asking them how many people died in the Holocaust and receiving the accurate answer of six million, the instructor responded “Yes.Onlysix million,” before adding, “colonizers killed more than six million. Israel is a colonizer.” Such incidents make many Jewish students at Stanford afraid to come to class. The Stanford Jewish community appreciates the courage and moral clarity of those who have stood up as allies to the Jewish people over past days. President Joe Biden has rightlycalled outHamas’ attack as “an act of sheer evil” and taken important steps to defend the lives of Israelis and Jewish Americans in these threatening times. His leadership in uniting the world behind Israel’s defense and Hamas’ destruction sends a clear message (seehis letter, co-signed by Stanford alumnus Rishi Sunak, prime minister of the United Kingdom, along with the leaders of Germany, France and Italy . President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has alsoexpressedstrong support for Israel in response to Hamas’ attack, connecting his own country’s struggle against Russia’s invasion to Israel’s defense against Hamas’ invasion (as well asaccusingRussia of supporting Hamas’ operations . Here on campus, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Ricebroughtcomfort to many by taking the stage at Tuesday night’s White Plaza community vigil to express her support for Israel and Stanford’s Jewish community. Like most Jews, I seek the peace and security of Israel as a Jewish state in the indigenous homeland of the Jewish people, a safe haven after millennia of persecution where Jews can finally claim control over their own destiny. Likewise, like most Jews, I also dream of a future of dignity and freedom for the Palestinian people, who, by the very same principles of self-determination, deserve a state of their own in a land that they too have called home for many centuries. However, Hamas’ ideology of hate and methods of terrorism are contrary to that vision. The wanton bloodshed and carnage that these past days of terror have brought are obviously not the path to liberation; they are instead the harbinger of continued large-scale, unnecessary suffering for innocent Israelis and Palestinians alike. I fervently hope for a day when all Israelis, Palestinians and others living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea can live together in peace as neighbors. As we yearn for that future, please join me in praying for the memory of 2,000 civilians, Israeli, Palestinian and others, who have lost their lives in the past five days of violence. For their sake, from the destruction of war, we must build a better future. “May the Maker of peace in high places make peace for all of us and for all of Israel.” Matthew Wigler ’19 J.D. ’25 Co-President of the Jewish Law Students Association The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.

crimson_2023_157,"In the winter of my freshman year, I may have inadvertently caused a fire in Weld Hall. It was a snowy afternoon when I keyed into my dorm and noticed that four children behind me had slipped in. They sprinted up the stairs, and seconds before the fire alarm rang, I heard one of them shout “Don’t!” Outside, some people claimed they saw smoke while others reported that it was a false alarm. A pang of guilt lingered inside me as I watched firetrucks round the corner. Ever since that day, my compunction has compelled me to reconsider our protective measures for dorms in the Yard. The fire was my fault, but I continued to wonder why the Yard, a tourist magnet and the campus nucleus, seems to contain the lowest levels of dorm entry security. The first-year dorm security seems incongruous with the rest of Harvard’s campus, especially the Houses, where Securitas officers are a regular nightly sight at entrances. Even then, I’ve found that those security guards play a relatively passive role when it comes to preventing unwanted visitors from entering. Indeed, there is a consistent history of crime in the Yard:Seemingly almost every year,it is plaguedby a stringof dorm room thefts. In response to these security breaches, the Harvard University Police Department seems to investigate the instances but rarely discover any culprits, and its responses tend to only emphasize how students can behave better. In the past, efforts and suggestions were made by aCollege subcommittee on residential securityin conjunction with the then-Undergraduate Council to enhance security on campus, but none seem to have made any substantial progress — as evidenced by the Yard’s persistent robberies and burglaries. The issue of campus safety itself is intricate, given that improving preventive measures is not as linear as merely increasing the number of security guards. One thing we should never do is fully restrict the Yard to Harvard University ID members, essentially shutting out our neighbors and friends beyond Harvard’s gates. I do align, however, with thecase for closing the Yardat night to all except ID holders at four remaining entrances, which promotes a safer campus without magnifying Harvard’s overall elitism and campus inaccessibility. The solution to minimizing residential security breaches also lies outside the domain of policing. It would hardly be an overstatement to say that no one wants HUPD patrolling outside of their dorms, given privacy concerns and potential discomfort with the troubling history of racial profiling by college police. For active responses to crime, we currently still rely on HUPD, which claims to be working on improving itself as part of theReimagining Campus Community Safety initiative. Preventive measures for dorm safety, however, should come from a different source. In 2017, an undergraduate on the College residential security subcommittee proposed installing security cameras in dorms and Houses. While I’m unsure whether a full suite of security cameras is necessary, adopting modern safety technology is the right path to securing the yard. Recently, I visited some friends at neighboring colleges, and I realized how austere and old-fashioned the first-year dorms at Harvard are. To enter my friend’s dorm elsewhere, I had to sign a guest pass, then scan a QR code, then confirm my identity before the security doorman opened a side door for me to enter. Another one of the dorm entrances even had digital turnstiles, which may be too reminiscent of a subway system but seemed effective nonetheless for forbidding unwanted guests from sneaking in from behind. At Harvard, we do have turnstiles in the Yard, but they serve to protect the books in Widener. We should wonder why it is much more difficult to enter Widener than it is to sneak into a freshman Harvard dorm. Do we value the safety of our books more than our students? Perhaps all this fuss about residential safety is an overreaction, and the Yard is already just about as safe as we can make it. The2022 HUPD annual security reportindicated the lowest levels of crime in the past decade, despite Cambridge having thehighest rate of crime in recent years. But amid the lowered crime rates, the consistently high incidence of break-ins demonstrate that the Yard still has issues with residential safety. When petty theft evolves to campus shootings and other serious crimes, it’ll be too late to start making changes then. The Yard hasn’t been extensively renovatedsince 1994. Perhaps we can start by adding a turnstile to Weld. Jeffrey B. Shi ’26, a Crimson Editorial Editor, lives in Currier House."
state_press_2023_9,"As a young nonbinary writer, I naturally spend quite a bit of time thinking about gender. Through my countless hours of pondering, I’ve discovered it’s clear that every gender reacts to this world in a different way. Women are still reeling from the many waves of feminism, gender-nonconforming individuals are being attacked almost everyday, and men have only just been told that everything they’ve ever done is wrong. I empathize with men, I swear. Pinky promise. I’m no misandrist, and I can understand the turmoil a man would face with this new knowledge. How is one expected to cope when their entire world comes crashing down? But, empathy aside —what the hell is wrong with men? Stripped of their core values — strength, machismo, emotional repression and heavily taking advantage of every single person in their lives — men are spiraling. They feel lost, with no way to interact with their world. Yet, instead of discovering the other ways in which they can find value, they’ve reduced themselves to their physical forms. They have wholeheartedly convinced themselves that their value lies in height, muscles, penis size and how similar they are to a wolf. Coping is one thing. Creating an entire wolf-based ranking system is another. To be completely fair and balanced, these ideas aren’t entirely out of left field. A scientificstudyconducted by a group of psychologists and biologists found that women tend to value height in a partner more than men do. So before any men come beating down my door, I concede — sometimes, women are terrible too. Better yet, in a brave act of selflessness, I was in a long-term relationship with a man who was 5-foot-2. You’re all welcome. While literally only one of these issues is valid, the rest are bananas. Pure bananas. Since the dawn of time, men have been obsessed with their own penises. One of their favorite pastimes is measuring it, sending photos of it unannounced, looking at other men’s penises, thinking about other men’s penises… Really, I’ve never seen a queerer thing in my life. On absolutely no basis of truth, men areconvincedthat everyone else is thinking about their penises too. A real projection issue. In reality,nobody is thinking about your penis.Not a soul in this world is concerned about your penis. I promise. And I’m not just making this stuff up — I brought the cold hard facts. Astudyby Superdrug Online Doctor, in which 1,500 people were polled, found 92% of women think penis size is “not a deterrent.” This proves, once and for all, that you are the only person thinking about your penis. I repeat. It’s just you. You’re the insane person with a penis obsession, not me. Except for right now. At this exact moment, I totally am thinking about your penis. Your penis specifically. Up until now, everything has simply been an appetizer. A first course. An amuse-bouche, if you will. This is the meat and potatoes. My very own pot pie. Get this,menhave decided to becomewolves.On all levels except physical, they are wolves now. Awoooooooo. In animal ethology, it’s been long documented that wolves follow a hierarchical system within their packs: The stronger alphas lead, and the weaker betas follow. I imagine most of us have heard some version of this. Yet, from this scientific concept, men have achieved their greatest delusion yet. According to them, all men can be placed in this socio-sexual hierarchy, and their desirability is determined by it. So, using real science about wolves (not people , men have invented their own pseudoscience. It’s like if cavemen found a dictionary and made a religion from it. For some context, I’ll briefly explain this hierarchy in “manosphere” terms. According to The Power Moves, an alpha male (officially is a man who is high rank, driven, dominant, confident, competent, Machiavellian, masculine and fit. Most of these traits are pretty reasonable — it makes sense that a powerful person would be driven and confident. My queries lie with the last three on this list. Masculine and fit are just weird, but Machiavellian? That’s a big leap. All that means is an alpha is good at scheming. According to the men — not me!!! — a man should be a con artist. This article writes itself, I swear. On the other hand, the official traits of a beta male are not looking so good. An official “beta male” is apparently low rank, lazy, submissive, insecure, sloppy, naive, unmasculine and a junk eater? If you’re a beta male, don’t be discouraged! Just dig a big hole and never come out. The alphasprobablywon’t find you. Because it’s pseudoscience, the internet’s most adored propaganda spewers are, predictably, all over this. Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate have all spoken on this exciting new tool for brainwashing. In one lovely video, Peterson tries to explain what being an alpha is about. And let me tell you —tryis a really strong word. Through over seven minutes of the loudest uncopyrighted music possible, Peterson gives a riveting speech aboutsomething. I can definitely get that much from it. The only notes I wrote down were as follows: time is coming to eat you, plumbers have saved more lives than doctors, and hippies. Something about hippies. I swear I tried to listen. Genuinely, without bias, serious face on, I went to listen to this speech. I left in tears. That man makes no sense, and if you claim to understand him, you may be suffering from a severe head injury. Seek medical help immediately. However, upon personal investigation, I agree. Everything these men have said is true. If you’re an alpha male, your life does matter on this Earth. To determine if you’re worthy, use my simple checklist below: If you answered yes to any of the questions above, you might just be an alpha male! INFP? Who cares? Whatreallymatters is whether you’re a sigma, alpha or worthless beta. Men, directionless and alone, fell right into the alt-right pipeline once again. The real kiddie pool of fascism. We all live in the Mojo Dojo Casa House, and alpha Kens rule this beta Barbie universe. My running theory is that men have completely forgotten what being human feels like. It’s not entirely their fault, but they’re so far off this wagon right now. You know what a woman really wants? Not a dick. I swear to you, any of us will actually take any of you! Just not Nazis! Or homophobes, or anything else in this manosphere of yours. But apparently, that’s too hard for you! So you obsess and obsess and obsess over things that have no meaning at all in the grand scheme of things. I feel for you guys: You’re lost and need direction. But pretending to be a pack of wolves is objectively the wrong direction. Every single man in the universe walked out at the 45-minute mark of the “Barbie” movie. Here’s a tip: Sit down and finish the movie for God’s sake. Maybe then you can stop thinking about your own penis so much. Please snap out of this.

crimson_2023_13,"Navigating the minefield of discussing mental illness at Harvard requires extreme acrobatics. It’s okay to joke about having depression due to courses and extracurriculars that drain energy and free time. It’s okay to talk about coping mechanisms, like chocolate-fueled movie marathons. It’s okay — and even encouraged, in order to humanize yourself and reduce others’ impostor syndrome — to poke holes in Harvard’s pervasive perfectionism by saying that your anxiety is keeping you up at night. What’s not okay is mentioning an official diagnosis. With that admission comes a change in social perception. You won’t be cut off — hopefully — but your friends will start being cautious. Gone are emergency conclaves to de-escalate minor exam anxiety. Gone is exaggerated ‘depression’ after romantic disappointment. Your friends’ behavioral adjustment could stem from fear of sounding insensitive and undervaluing your struggle. But more likely, it’s because you’re now seen as a ticking tear bomb that could explode at any second — especially if provoked with unknown triggering topics or mentions of negative feelings. Behind these rolls of yellow caution tape, however, are prejudices that most students deliberately ignore. As Harvard students, we like to see ourselves as universal allies. But in reality, many of us are ignorant about the truth of mental illness. Getting accepted into Harvard, let alone distinguishing yourself once you get here, requires tremendous effort that often comes at the cost of your overall well-being. The sacrifices that you make along the way are painful, and that anguish often lends itself to toxic comparison; everyone else, after all, is going through the same thing, yet many of them do not have depression. This idea of toxic productivity — the notion that you must overwork yourself in every aspect of your life to be deserving of a Harvard success story — leads to people struggling with mental illness being perceived as weak, demanding special treatment because they are unable to handle the pressure of Harvard life. Hence, in an environment where your social currency is often the combination of charisma and perceived potential for success, admitting that you are mentally ill seems like a self-imposed scarlet letter, an intimidating red button that you would be prudent to avoid. It appears that the greatest hurdle to helping mental health at Harvard is reducing the stigma around mental illness perpetuated between College students. WhileHarvard provides mental health services, likeTimelyCareand theCAMHS Cares 24/7 hotline, and students have organizedpeer support groups,artistic demonstrations, andwell-being weeks, these initiatives have yet to meaningfully reduce the social barriers and misconceptions that come with mental illness. Student advocates can push for change. However, to do so, they must find the bravery to tell their own stories of mental health struggles — an unfair and emotionally taxing request. Such vulnerability should be nobody’s responsibility. But if some of us can find the courage to stand up, we can make a real impact. As the number of students who share their struggles increases, as more students understand just how many of their brilliant, accomplished friends are struggling with serious anxiety and depression, it becomes harder to sustain ignorant and harmful behaviors, both explicitly and implicitly. But I suppose it would be hypocritical not to practice what I preach. Hi, I am Alexandra. I have been struggling with depression for two years and anxiety for about five. No, that does not mean that I spend my days hysterically crying every five minutes, or having panic attacks over getting Bs — although it shouldn’t change the calculus if I did. Regardless, I think I am doing a pretty good job at being a Harvard student. I don’t want overcompensation-fueled ‘support.’ But I do want you to start thinking about the reasons behind the assumptions you might have made about me when you read this paragraph. In spite of the kind intentions behind your potential pity, it’s not productive; instead, such pity often strengthens a patronizing perception of people like me as immobilized individuals instead of competent adults. Finally, if the thought that I could be leveraging my mental illness to feel special even crossed your mind, I plead with you: Why would someone choose a condition that puts them in danger of alienating their loved ones solely as a mechanism to garner sympathy? I’ll end this piece with a call, not to action, but to deep introspection. Think about the role each one of us plays in the fear that our fellow students on this campus feel when they contemplate revealing to their friends the real reason behind unusual silence during dinner. About our contributions to Harvard’s hyper-competitive culture, a culture that promotes the internalization of negative feelings to avoid being labeled by others as ‘weak.’ And think about the ways that we can stop mental illness from only being allowed to exist as a bad word or a joke — within this campus and beyond.

stanforddaily_2023_72,"The future of racial diversity in higher education currently hangs in the balance. Likemany legal experts, we expect that the Supreme Court will declare race-based affirmative action unconstitutional with their decisions inStudents for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolinaand, more pertinently for Stanford,Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. The decisions are expected in the coming weeks. Some experts believe these rulingswon’t changethe racial composition of colleges that practice holistic admissions. We disagree. Without preparation, we already know what the outcome of this decision may look like. The enrollment of Black and Latine students at UC Berkeley and UCLAdroppedby around 50% following Proposition 209, a 1996 California law banning the consideration of race in state university admissions. We resolutely support affirmative action. The policy remains crucial to advancing two critical goals: enhancing social mobility and unlocking the academic benefits that arise from a diverse student population. It is well-documented that Black and Latine children do not have access to the same educational resources as their white counterparts on average, putting them at a disadvantage in the college admissions process. In nearly every state in the country, Black and Latine students are more likely than white students to attendunder-resourcedschoolsand live indisadvantagedneighborhoods. Non-holistic college admissions criteria do not take these factors into account: a disparity that affirmative action attempts to redress. Highly-selective colleges are the gateway to the elite in the U.S., producingleadersand high-earners in politics, law, medicine, engineering, business and the arts. Affirmative action therefore serves social mobility by propelling more historically marginalized students into the social and economic elite. Moreover, by increasing representation of marginalized voices in the elite, affirmative action ensures that the concerns and perspectives of marginalized groups are better represented in society at large. This, in turn, helps to break down the existinginstitutional barriersthat prevent marginalized individuals from succeeding. Affirmative action also improves the educational experience for all students, not just for those who directly benefit. InGrutter v. Bollinger(2003 , Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote for the Supreme Court’s majority opinion that using race in admissions “furthers a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.” Ensuring racial and cultural diversity at universities allows students to learn not just from their lectures, but from each other in and out of the classroom. By exposing students to a diverse range of viewpoints and lived experiences, universities prepare them to become responsible and well-qualified members of a cosmopolitan society. As a research university, Stanford alsostrongly benefitsfrom diversity in the laboratory; in its amicus brief for the Harvard and UNC cases, the university wrote that “diversity promotes better science,” a claim that is extensively backed in thebrief. There are, of course, imperfections in existing affirmative action policies. Asking students to describe their race — essentially, the color of their skin — obscures important details about their ethnicity. The current system of collecting racial data paints each group as a monolith, when in fact students’ experiences and socioeconomic status can vary wildly depending on their ethnicity or heritage. For example, among Black students at elite colleges, African Americans who are descendants of slaves areunderrepresentedcompared to Black students who are first- or second- generation African immigrants. Some also argue that affirmative action policiesbenefitwealthy racial minorities — however, this is likely a symptom ofcollege admissionsas a whole, rather than affirmative action specifically. Perhaps as a response to these issues, many supposedly “race-neutral” admissions policies have been floated as alternatives for race-based affirmative action. These include class-based affirmative action, ending legacy admissions, and eliminating Early Action. These policies may mitigate the effects of ending race-based affirmative action, but they are not a sufficient replacement to maintain the current level of racial diversity at selective institutions. Harvard’s 2018Smith Report, which modeled the results of effecting these policies, concluded that the university would experience a significant decline in the enrollment of Black students in every scenario. Therefore affirmative action remains the most effective admissions policy to enhance diversity. With these pillars of our education at stake, we are calling for Stanford to lay out a clear roadmap in advance of the Supreme Court ruling. We want to know what could change and how the university plans to respond, even without all the details of the ruling. Peer institutions have already responded: Stanford could hold a panel on the upcoming decisions asPrincetonrecently did, with Stanford legal experts, moderated by university leadership. Stanford could create a website outlining the relevant facts and numbers of the admissions process, likeHarvarddid. President Marc Tessier-Lavigne could make the case for affirmative action, asColumbia’s president Lee Bollinger has repeatedly done. Due to the ongoing Harvard lawsuit, the public has gained unprecedented insight into Harvard’s admissions process and how it factors race into the equation — for example, viaits infamous personality rating, which purports to measure personal qualities like courage, leadership, kindness, and integrity. The plaintiffs argue that this subjective rating has unfairly disadvantaged Asian applicants, who receivelower personal ratingson average than other racial groups. These conversations are crucial; hidden factors like personality ratings determine who is granted admission into the most hallowed halls of education. We want to know how Stanford does it too: we are asking Stanford to let some light into the black box of admissions. Why do we deserve to know? Without an understanding of the current admissions process, we cannot prepare ourselves for the scope of change that may follow the Supreme Court rulings. Even for admitted students who later read their admissions file, the process is remarkably opaque. Admissions files are typically heavily redacted and coded with abbreviations which, even when spelled out, remain vague — using terms like “intellectual vitality” (IV and “high school rating” (HSR . The outcome of the Supreme Court decision will deeply affect all members ofour community. It is an especially great cause of anxiety for underrepresented students whose communities at Stanford may shrink. Diversity is core to the academic and personal development of Stanford students. It is very important to maintain, and also very difficult to maintain; we need to know Stanford’s plan. For a start, it is unclear what it means for colleges to not take race into account in admissions. Because race is a pervasive and critical component of many students’ lived experiences, students often participate in identity-based clubs and write about their familial and cultural background in required application essays. How will colleges use this information? Sometimes students’ last names can reveal their ethnic heritage — will this influence admissions officers’ assessments? We are asking the following: If Stanford truly prioritizesgiving students“the opportunity to learn from the wonderful diversity of identities, experiences, and perspectives that exist in the world,” then it should work in advance to transparently inform students and all who will be affected by this monumental ruling. We have faith that Stanford administrators will fulfill its commitments to underrepresented students: it is now crucial to tell us how.

crimson_2023_141,"Not long ago, an Iranian woman in my class told me that in her country, one had to be careful about what you said in public, but could say what you wanted in private. “At Harvard, however, it’s the reverse,” she said. This is the self-censorship some Harvard students complain of. Only some complain because the complaint is directed against the rest who dominate conversation and do not want to hear opposition. These dominant students may not begin as a majority, but the activist few create the majority who accept their view and then impose it on those who disagree, forcing them to censor themselves. The punishment for not censoring yourself is to lose the company of fellow students and to be disregarded and shunned. You are not put in jail, as happens in Iran and other countries, but you are deprived of the fellowship you want from college life. I don’t know how widespread the necessity to censor oneself is felt, but I think the judgment behind it is pretty accurate. In practice, Harvard is a one-party spot, much more so than even the practically one-party state and one-party city in which it resides. But is this such an unhappy fact? Self-censorship might seem to be a part of self-control based on the need to respect others. Everyone knows what tact is, and as one matures one gains experience of the great truth that it often pays to keep your mouth shut. You may be proud of the many wise and witty things you say, but with your mouth shut you will not be embarrassed by the few foolish remarks you let slip. From the standpoint of tact, self-censorship might seem to be an education in prudence and responsibility. Perhaps the complainers about self-censorship should be boasting of their ability to exercise prudence. They are getting a better education than the many who live unprotesting and almost unconscious in the Harvard bubble. Conservatives, I like to say, get more from Harvard by having to be critical of its boring, politicized conformity — and by being forced into self-censorship. Upon graduation they can go elsewhere and enjoy a freedom they have prepared for themselves. Yet if self-censorship is a benefit, should it not be made more general than it is? All should experience the feeling of taking a course where one sits in silence as an unaddressed minority. Why should genuine education be reserved for conservatives? But this reasoning might suggest that everyone should spend a term in jail to learn what it’s like. Then let’s move from the benefit to the harm of self-censorship. Today, self-expression has much greater sway than self-control. To be free, it is said, you must be able to express yourself and be safe while doing so. To express yourself fully means to fashion your own identity. And to do that, the danger of being offended in your identity becomes a vital point: You must be free both to take offense when you are disrespected and to give offense when your own identity demands it. Everyday slight offenses loom as large as major ones that are rare. Self-expression permits, even requires, that the names people use be inspected for the harm they cause. Once respected names like Woodrow Wilson and John Winthrop may need to be abandoned and tossed into the trash can of non-history. Pronouns, too, need to be revised so as not to offend persons formerly known as women; no more impersonal he or him, no more chairman or freshman. Do people object to such changes, made without their consent? Mostly not, but if they did, they would be informed that justice overrides their sense of offense, and they must consent to the kind of censorship that actually puts words in your mouth. They must learn the new expressions and learn to like them. Self-censorship raises your consciousness and wakes you up so that you can join the woke. Is anything lost by being woke? Yes, let me suggest there is. Instead of arguing the point, one begins to search for character defects and pounce when they are found. You blind yourself by taking offense because in doing so you are led to simplify the justice you think is so unquestionable. Instead of thinking about what justice might require, you try to shame opposition out of existence. Believing that justice is easy to think, you begin to believe it is easy to apply. You conclude that slavery was as easy to abolish as to denounce today after it is abolished. You regard those who gave their lives in a Civil War to gain that end as less just than we are now, bravely changing names and pronouns. You agree that Harvard has a legacy of slavery rather than the legacy of anti-slavery you can see every day with a glimpse of Memorial Hall. My argument against taking offense ends up by taking offense. I got there in defense of the honor of Harvard, which I have always loved a little more than it deserves. Now, facing my 70th reunion, it must be time to calm down and retire, accepting my own self-censorship. To the Class of 2023: Make a life for yourselves that you can be proud of. And by the way, to keep our classrooms full, we teachers are always grateful to former students who have children. Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 is the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Government."
state_press_2023_29,"Universities across the country are banning TikTok on their school WiFi due to various security concerns and college student screen addictions. Across the nation, universities are banning the immensely popular social media platform TikTok from school-operated Wi-Fi networks and devices. The short-form video-sharing app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has been under intense scrutiny for supposed cybersecurity breaches. Arizona is not currently among the states who have issued a comprehensive ban on TikTok on government-operated or university-owned devices. I cannot say whether it will be added to this growing list, but I can say that I would fully support the barring of the platform from ASU s technology and internet. In Arizona, Rep. Matt Gress, R-4, has proposedHouse Bill 2416. This bill is considered a strike everything amendment, as it currently contains writing that will later be replaced with different information on a new topic. While the new bill describes the banning of covered applications, it is clearly in reference to TikTok and ByteDance, citing an application developed or provided by a private Chinese internet technology company founded on March 13, 2012. If passed, this bill would require the state to remove any covered application from state information technology such as phones, computers or any other state-issued and owned electronicdevices capable of internet connectivity. Fountain Hills Councilmember Allen Skillicorn has already banned the app on town-operated devices and servers, citing the time-wasting algorithm and potential threats to national security. In a recent tweet, he urged fellow government officials, including Gov. Katie Hobbs, to follow in his footsteps. Hobbs has not yet responded to Skillicorn’s push. We banned TikTok from the townhall here in Fountain Hills, where is Katie Hobbs on this one? Social media addiction is an ever-increasing issue for college-aged people,with 51% of individualsages 18 to 24 reporting that they would find it difficult to give up social media according to Pew Research Center. The TikTok algorithm only exacerbates this tendency towards addiction, acting as a superfood for the brain’s reward center by carefully dispersing short videos that will capture the user’s attention and keep them wanting more. I find that I could easily spend over an hour a day mindlessly scrolling through TikTok. I’ve gone through periods of time where I’ve deleted the app — including now — however, the trends and humor circulating on the platform has always exacerbated my fear of missing out. I re-download it every time. When I come back to the platform, I am not simply giving the algorithm my time and attention. I am also giving the company copious amounts of data, which could be used for far more than deciding which videos to put on my “For You Page.” TikTok s data collection strategies allow the app to gather user information such as contact lists and calendars. Additionally, it allows for hourly device geolocation and the scanning of both internal and external hard drives. In October 2022, Forbes reported that ByteDance sInternal Audit teamplanned to collect multiple users IP addresses for undisclosed purposes. The company did not disclose whether or not the targeted individuals were government officials, journalists, public figures or other prominent citizens. A TikTok spokesperson said that IP addresses are solely used for providing users with relevant content. Squashing threats to national security is far more important than maintaining a highly replaceable app. Tensions surrounding the potential invasions of privacy from the Chinese government across the United States are rising due to the recentspy balloonthat was shot down off the coast of South Carolina. Bipartisanship is crucial when protecting our nation from this technological danger. This issue is not a partisan one and should not be thought of in that manner. The privacy issues with TikTok were a priority during former President Donald Trump s tenure in office, threatening a complete ban across the United States in 2020.President Biden is also taking measures to address potential threats posed by the platform. In September 2022, Biden issued an executive order specifying risks that the Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States must keep in mind when evaluating foreign-owned companies. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-CO, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-IL, have also joined the ranks of politicians calling for the ban of TikTok, further blurring party lines on this pervasive issue. In terms of college students attitudes, it’s easy for them to believe their data doesn’t matter because they have nothing crucial that could be used against them. This is far from the truth. TikTok’s collection of data to use how they wish poses an enormous national security risk for its over one billion users, regardless of their data contents. However, ASU can put a small, yet crucial, dent in TikTok’s data collection. As one of the top 10 largest universities in the U.S., ASU can set an example for schools across the nation by banning TikTok on University-owned Wi-Fi networks and devices.As of Fall 2022,enrollment across ASU’s campuses has reached 79,232 students, the vast majority of which utilize ASU Wi-Fi to complete their assignments on campus, and those who live on campus most likely use it as their primary network. By banning TikTok on campus devices and Wi-Fi networks, ASU can protect its students’ safety. Due to the prominence of the University, both in size and propensity for innovation, other universities could follow suit, thus preventing TikTok-using students from having any more of their information absorbed into the app s vast database.

This month The Stanford Daily celebrates 50 years of independence from Stanford University. The years leading up to the separation in 1973 were tumultuous, with violent protests and strident arguments over social policies, the Vietnam War and a sheriff’s raid on The Daily. The parting was by mutual agreement: The Daily wanted freedom from University control, and the University wanted insulation from controversies and liabilities flowing from the Daily’s work. The publisher is The Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation, a California public benefit corporation and an IRS 501(c (3 charitable organization. Each editor in chief is the president and CEO. A Board of Directors governs the corporation: four members are current students, one (the COO is a recent graduate, and four are seasoned professionals in the fields of journalism, business, academia and law. Apart from the COO, an all-student staff manages and operates The Daily. The Daily occupies a dedicated building, under a long-term lease with the University, built with donations from Daily alumni, principally Lorry Lokey ’49. The Daily and the University also negotiated a contract, the Memorandum of Understanding, which protects The Daily as an exceptional student organization with carefully demarcated boundaries of University control. Thus, the University and the Daily are contract counterparties. What does independence mean in practice? Typically, student newspapers have numerous pressure points: access to facilities, finances, university discipline against student organizations or individual students, intimidation by faculty and staff and alumni complaints to the university. Thanks to its legal status, contracts, corporate board, outside advisors and lawyers, The Daily can live by the maxim “without fear or favor.” The Daily does not answer to any University officer, faculty member or administrator for its publishing activities. Some faculty and staff are surprised at the response when they threaten or try to intimidate The Daily’s personnel. If the University or an employee encroaches on The Daily’s independence, directors will show up in support if necessary, and lawyers are available to enforce the Memorandum of Understanding. All this allows The Daily to publish articles that discuss or challenge powerful University figures, as several recent articles have done. Reporters can follow the news wherever it leads them, focusing without distraction on the hard work of great news sourcing, writing, and editing. Their pieces can serve the entire University community, as well as the broader public interest given Stanford’s academic, economic, and cultural prominence. I was a Daily staffer in the mid-1970s, shortly after independence. I joined The Daily’s Board four years ago, and I have been amazed at how complex the operation has become since my undergraduate days. The advent of digitization, incorporation of audiovisual reporting, online presence, new publishing and reader engagement channels, transformation of the advertising marketplace and greater prominence of the University, as well as the social and political pressures of this era create nearly unfathomable challenges in the lives of reporters and editors who are full-time undergraduate students. Freedom from the additional pressure and limitations of University control or oversight gives breathing room for The Daily’s staffers to develop their skills, provide the best possible service to the community and join earlier Daily alumni in the top ranks of reporters and editors in the nation. Andrew Bridges ’76 is currently the chair of The Daily’s board of directors."
crimson_2023_116,"For 50 years, students and faculty have repeatedly organized to expand Ethnic Studies at Harvard. We’ve made some progress, but much work remains to be done: “Cluster hires” and administrative efforts toexpand faculty position offeringsare not nearly enough. At Yale, students enjoy the benefits of a full-fledged undergraduate degree program in Ethnic Studies, and our colleagues at Princeton havegained from our faculty losses. With students having organized for Ethnic Studies at Harvard just last week, we should think critically about the fight to promote this curriculum beyond the walls of our University. It may be in our best interest to refocus attention towards planting the seeds of an ethnic studies education earlier — in our elementary and secondary schools. Massachusetts House of Representatives Bill S.288/H.542, referred to the Education Committee this February, calls to “promote racially inclusive curriculum in schools,” establishing a fund to incorporate the histories and contributions of marginalized and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups into the curriculum of K-12 schools. Why should we care? Significant evidence shows that developing cultural competence and an appreciation for society’s diversity and historical nuance within students early on is vital. A2021 Stanford studyfound that ethnic studies curriculum in the San Francisco Unified School District had a “remarkably prolonged and strong positive impact,” helping students “increase their overall engagement in school, probability of graduating and likelihood of enrolling in college.” Moreover, the study demonstrated that ethnic studies had increased students’ sense of belonging and relevance in their communities. I’m keenly aware of the salience of race in debates over K-12 curriculum. This is not a piece whose goal is to strike down every qualm with critical race theory or add fire to the flames of a hyperpolarized discussion that’s been broken beyond repair. Rather, I aim to set terms for a more well-intentioned conversation over the educational and social-emotional merits of a racially-inclusive curriculum, putting aside racial dog whistles in the pursuit of maximizing students’ wellbeing and education. While ethnic studies may seem like a nebulous pursuit, particularly for younger students, we can visualize it through Terry Kawi’s metaphor ofwindows and mirrors. According to Kawi, an English and Language Arts teacher from California, racially-inclusive education would provide both windows — frames through which students experience cultures and lives apart from their own — and mirrors — opportunities for students to see themselves reflected in the narratives that they learn — in their pursuit of a balanced education. Beyond the benefits that racially inclusive curricula yield for students, K-12 ethnic studies in Massachusetts may just be the catalyst for a sustainable push for the subject at Harvard. Preventing burnout and sustaining momentum as we fight for a formalized Ethnic Studies curriculum at the College requires a student body confident in the field’s pedagogical value. If we know that ethnic studies programs at the primary and secondary levels work to uplift students and drive engagement, expanding these frameworks at the K-12 level could help the department find a stronger footing at Harvard. Perhaps this doesn’t concern you — perhaps you may not see the need for a specialized Ethnic Studies department at Harvard. After all, why is this specific educational niche one that we ought to promote? Harvard is synonymous with the gold standard. Whether we as students agree with its educational relevance or not, Harvard is the paragon of academic excellence. Our curricular offerings run the gamut, and at a school where every admitted class of students currently on campus ismajority non-white, the absence of a department devoted to the critical analysis of our student body’s diverse racial and ethnic perspectives is inexcusable. Whether one chooses to study Ethnic Studies at Harvard or not, the existence of a department on campus that willfully and rigorously investigates corrupted historical, scientific, and political narratives is critical. The only way that Harvard will continue to live up to its academic reputation is to develop students and push forth a curriculum that embodies critical, constant questioning. We must recognize that the lack of Ethnic Studies on campus is symptomatic of a national unfamiliarity with and antagonism to critical education on race and ethnicity. Absent rigorous educational reform at the K-12 level (through legislation like the Massachusetts State Act to Promote Racially Inclusive Curriculum in Schools , Harvard students may continue to arrive on our campus lacking the cultural competence and complete education necessary to appreciate and sustain our diverse community. We know that empowering younger students with the windows and mirrors to see their own experiences and the experiences of others reflected in their education yields remarkably positive educational outcomes. So perhaps it’s time for us organizing for Ethnic Studies to expand our audience, vying not only for a balanced education at Harvard, but also for the Harvard students of tomorrow.

ubyssey_2023_16,"May 29, 2023 Written byIman Janmohamed Ever asked Iman (hey, that’s me! a question that was short, sweet and maybe not actually something anyone can actually give you advice on? Well, this is for you! You asked. I answered. Below is a bunch of questions — some silly, some serious — that you’ve sent in. Should I put milk after cereal just to be more socially acceptable? Yes. You must stop your ways. What if you put in too much milk? Then what, more cereal? But then what if it’s too much? Do you save it? Throw it away? The logistics are making my head hurt. I do a lot of writing for work and school but my TAs and coworkers always get annoyed when I use commas wrong. As an English major, can you teach me? If there’s one thing I’m good for, it’s yelling at people (in a kind and loving manner when commas are used incorrectly. The main types of commas are listing commas, joining commas and bracketing commas. Listing commas are used in lists (obviously and can replace the word “and” or “or.” For example, in the sentence “Iman is very funny and humble and kind,” the first “and” can be replaced with a comma and the second ‘and’ can have a comma before it (unless you don’t use the Oxford comma but that’s a whole ‘nother can of worms . Joining commas join independent clauses by marking their separation. These clauses become one when joined by conjunctions. For example, the comma here is a joining comma — “The Ubysseyis UBC’s student paper, but CiTR is the radio station.” Bracketing commas serve as quasi-em dashes. They set aside clauses, phrases or words that are added to a sentence, but not essential to its meaning. For example, the sentence “Spencer,The Ubyssey’s opinion editor, is from Vancouver,” has bracketing commas. There are a bunch more rules — like using commas after introductory clauses that come before a sentence’s main clause and using commas to shift between a sentence’s main idea and a quotation — but that’s the gist. And if I messed up any commas here, please don’t tell me. I have a hard time saying no to social outings. How can I get better at this? The answer comes down to understanding that you need to take care of yourself before you do anything else. Taking care of yourself and doing things like doing your laundry, cleaning your countertops, taking showers, charging your phone, etc. are all things that you need to do for you. Becoming better at saying no comes from one thing — establishing that you come first. I know. It’s cliche, but true. You need to do those self-maintaining activities and keep working toward that degree. You shouldn’t feel like you have to blow off finishing your homework to hang out with your friends when you don’t want to. Having to feel like that eliminates the point of saying yes, which is to go have fun and relax. Saying no might make you feel like you’re letting down your friends, but taking care of yourself isn’t something to be ashamed of. The fear of missing out is real, and damn, I feel it a lot. But, you do not have to feel like you have to say yes to plans every single time when you just don’t have the capacity for it. That’s valid. And in the end, you’ll likely find the times you do say yes, with the capacity and time for it, more worthwhile.

crimson_2023_52,"Currently, Harvard has no cultural club specifically for Ukrainian undergraduates. Almost two years have passed since the Russian invasion, and with the war nearly stalemated, the West’s enthusiasm to support Ukraine slowly ebbing, and the conflict in Israel splitting attention and resources from that in Ukraine, the country is desperate for more support. At a time when Ukrainian students are most vulnerable, this lack of organization is alarming. As a Ukrainian American, one of the biggest reasons I chose Harvard was its Ukrainian Research Institute, a center dedicated to advancing research and teaching on Ukraine. As an outspoken activist for my country back in high school, I was eager to continue that work in college, taking advantage of the wealth of funds and opportunities I imagined were available at Harvard. Knowing of the successful fundraising campaigns for Ukraine at other schools, including Brown University and Yale University, I joined a group of like-minded students to fundraise for the well-known charity Come Back Alive, which provides arms and equipment for Ukrainian soldiers. Alas, we soon realized that there were substantial institutional obstacles in the way. First, without an affinity group for Ukrainian undergraduates, we have struggled to connect with networks of activists and procure funding to support cultural and fundraising initiatives. Second, we cannot create a new affinity group, because Harvard hasput a pause onrecognizing new independent student organizations this year in order to “conduct a thorough assessment of the independent student organization environment.” It remains unclear when the normal application process for creating a new club will resume. This put our activism in a strange limbo. Determined to find other outlets for my advocacy, I contacted the president of the Harvard Ukrainian Student Association, which is a broader organization for all Ukrainian Harvard affiliates across the University’s schools. Unfortunately, judging from the website, which is out-of-date, HUSA is not very active. It doesn’t even hold regular meetings and seems disengaged from undergraduate life. With the last panel HUSA publicized having happened last year, and no sign of plans for additional events, it is imperative for Harvard to bolster support for Ukraine beyond HUSA. And yet, the University erects barriers to our efforts at every turn. We cannot set up an information table in the Science Center Plaza or obtain funding because we aren’t an official club. We cannot become an official club due to the hold on recognizing new student organizations. And even if we somehow managed to get our club approved and obtain funding, the best way for us to fundraise would be a personal Venmo code — something that Harvard regulations also discourage. A university that claims to support Ukraine should not have so many restrictions on people trying to support Ukraine on campus. Harvard’s institutional legitimacy means its undergraduates have the potential to make a real impact with their activism. In over-regulating student organizations, Harvard falls short of its stated ideals. Concerns like these raise questions about the purpose of universities in the wider world. Is the only role of universities to supply knowledge, or do they have an obligation to actively act on that knowledge and support just causes around the world? I am inclined to think that it is both. When universities boast of their ideals, I believe we should expect them to act on these ideals in the real world. Fortunately, there are steps Harvard can take to remedy this situation. The first is to lift the hold on recognizing new student organizations and streamline the club creation and funding application process. The second is to expand Ukrainian visibility on campus, by promoting educational opportunities like the annual Temerty Contemporary Ukraine Program Conference, at which experts discuss policymaking and diplomacy in order to promote a deeper understanding of Ukraine in the world. Despite the obstacles facing student activism, our small but dedicated group of Ukrainian undergraduates on campus have continued to find ways to promote our cause. We have worked with Come Back Alive to find alternative ways to fundraise, reached out to Ukrainian teachers and faculty on campus to help us spread the word, and posted on social media sharing personal stories. But we still have yet to match the successful fundraising events for Ukrainians in need by our peers at Yale and Brown. It’s a shame that at a University with so many resources, it’s so difficult to get support for a cause that is so clearly in line with its ideals. Harvard has a duty to support its students, especially those whose homelands have been devastated by war. Diana A. Nichvoloda ’27, a Crimson Editorial comper, lives in Matthews Hall."
crimson_2023_29,"The horrific events that have unfolded in Israel and Gaza since theHamas attack on Oct. 7have roiled our campus. Some have spoken out strongly in support of Israel; others are passionate advocates for Palestinian rights. Tensions have flared. And then there are those, perhaps a quiet majority, who are unsure what to do: Which side should they support? Well, if you are one of those people, I may have a glimmer of good news for you amid all the horror: You can support both. You can stand for the right of Israelis to live in safety and security in a Jewish state and, at the same time, support the right of Palestinians to self-determination in a state of their own. What’s more, the way to do this has been an open secret for many decades now. It’s called thetwo-state solution. In the recent protests on our campus, the most common chant I heard was “free Palestine.” It is a powerful slogan, but also an ambiguous one. You should ask those who call for a “free Palestine” what they mean. If they mean an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, then they are in fact pro-Palestine and pro-Israel at once. But if they say they want an independent Palestinian state instead of Israel, ask them: What do you think should be done with themore than 7 million Jewswho now live between the river and the sea? Their answer will help you understand what they believe and whether it is something you can support. Okay, maybe the two-state solution is something that sounds good to you in principle, but you wonder: Can it be achieved? After all, the idea of partitioning the territory between a Jewish state and an Arab one has been aroundat least since the 1930s, and there wereserious efforts to achieve itin the 1990s and more sporadic efforts since. Why have all those efforts failed so far? This seems like a complicated question, and in many ways it is. But ultimately, it is not that hard. There were, and are, two main obstacles. On the Israeli side, it is the extremist settlers and their supporters, who believe that Palestinianshave no right to govern any part of the land. On the Palestinian side, it is Hamas and its supporters, who areunwilling to tolerate Jewish sovereigntyanywhere between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Could these obstacles be overcome? It will be hard. But we cannot give up on something so important just because it’s hard, especially when it’s the only hope we have of finally ending the carnage. Israel has removed settlements before, both in Sinai afterthe peace treaty with Egyptandin Gaza in 2005. TheWest Bank settlementsare more numerous, so removing them will be harder. But it is not impossible, and I firmly believe that, in the context of a peace agreement, it could be done. What about Hamas? Well, recent events have given us the most horrific reminder yet that if you support peace, you must reject Hamas. But this would not make you anti-Palestine. Quite the opposite. The weaker Hamas becomes,the greater the chancesare for a peace agreement that would allow an independent Palestine to thrive alongside Israel. So, not only is it possible to be anti-Hamas and pro-Palestine: If you support a free Palestine, you should oppose Hamas. Now, close your eyes and imagine a gathering of students, on the steps of Widener Library, who are both pro-Palestine and pro-Israel. What slogan would they chant? How about “free Palestine, free Israel, side by side”? Yes, it’s a little clunky. You could probably come up with a better one. But it’s unambiguous, it’s humane, and most importantly, it’s the only possible path we have toward ending the cycle of death. Erez Manela is the Francis Lee Higginson Professor of History."

stanforddaily_2023_104,"On April 12,Juulagreed to pay California, New York and four other states $462 million for misleading consumers — particularly young people — about the health effects of vaping. Juul was founded by Adam Bowen and James Monsees, who met through Stanford’s Product Design Master’s program. A day earlier,Elizabeth Holmes, a Stanford dropout,lost her bidto further delay her 11-year prison sentence for fraud.Sam Bankman-Fried, son of two Stanford professors, currently remains under house arrest on Stanford’s campus as he awaits trial for 12 counts of fraud and related crimes. The former CEO of Alameda ResearchCaroline Ellison, who earned her undergraduate degree at Stanford, took a plea deal for similar charges. Stanford Law School graduateCarlos Watsonwas indicted in February of this year for “a years-long multi-million dollar fraud scheme.” And only five months ago, Stanford professorStan Cohenpaid $29.2 million in damages after he committed “a species of actual fraud and… deceit” in misleading investors in his biotechnology startup. These high-profile fraud cases all share a common denominator: namely, Stanford. Each trial focuses more scrutiny on the institution that produced these crooked founders. But Stanford’s response, over and over again, has been deafening silence. When a Stanford student or alum achieves national recognition — such as being awarded a prestigious prize or fellowship, being drafted to a major sports league or making strides in research or entrepreneurship — Stanford is justifiably quick to celebrate. However, this is only true for achievements that reflect rosily onto Stanford’s own image. When Theo Bakerbecamethe youngest person ever to receive a prestigious George Polk Award in Journalism, there was no announcement in the Stanford Report, the University’s main external communications. Might this be related to the fact that Baker won the award for his investigation into claims of research fraud against Stanford’s president? Likewise, Stanford made no announcement concerning any of the verdicts or settlements mentioned above. Yes, we have mandatory Civic, Liberal and Global Education (COLLEGE and Embedded Ethics in Computer Science classes. Yes, we have graduation requirements in Ethical Reasoning (WAYS-ER and Exploring Difference and Power (WAYS-EDP . If we put aside students’ concerns that theCOLLEGEand Embedded Ethics programs fall short of their goals, this is all good and well. But if Stanford refuses to acknowledge the wrongdoings of its recent graduates, the University is denying its role in shaping leaders who have harmed people’s lives and livelihoods. Stanford gave each of these founders a shiny stamp on their resume that helped them woo investors. Stanford taught them much of what they know in business and beyond. Stanford gave them invaluable networks. Two Stanford professors even helped give SBF a temporary get-out-of-jail card by co-signing hisbail bond. In the words of Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne, Stanford was founded with the explicit purpose of“generating knowledge not for its own sake, but for the benefit of humanity.”It is impossible to meaningfully discuss and work towards benefitting humanity without understanding what leads to and causes harm. Stanford must lead these conversations even when they reflect badly on the University. Unlike its peers, Stanford does not have centuries of legacy and prestige to fall back on; these scandals threaten to undermine the university’s rapid ascension to the heights of innovation and progress. Therefore, Stanford should lead the narrative by addressing these issues head-on to restore confidence and to act as an example for other institutions. In addition to requiring ethics courses and issuing statements, we believe that Stanford should facilitate campus-wide critical conversations in light of emerging scandals to articulate what the institution stands for — and equally importantly, what it condemns. These discussion forums may be led byfacultyor student groups, providing a platform for community members to collectively deliberate about what went wrong in a particular case and how we students, future Stanford alums, can strengthen our sense of ethical responsibility. By sanctioning such events, the University would be confronting its scandals forthrightly — as opposed to burying its head in the sand. Student deliberations would help identify the corrupting influence present within Stanford’s culture and institutions. The administration, student groups (e.g. the ASSU and various labs could draw on the results of these deliberations to devise institutional solutions which address the issues raised by students. Moreover, the University could utilize these events as an opportunity to recenter andreaffirmits founding telos of “promoting the welfare of people everywhere.” They would serve as an extension of Stanford’s ethics education, as students get to examine and discuss real-world issues through an ethical lens. This proposed initiative may help reduce the number of scandalous alums and suspect businesses Stanford churns out in the future. This may salvage not only Stanford’s reputation, but potentially help prevent the suffering of millions of people.

rice_thresher_2023_26,"ByThresher Editorial Board10/3/23 11:52pm Last week, we reported on Rice Pride’s decision to cut ties with Houston Hillel. It was controversial, to say the least. An ugly debate reared its head on social media, with online fights and hateful comments breaking out. We unequivocally oppose any form of hate speech, doxxing or threats. We condemn any and all of this behavior that arose last week. Our mission is to promote the free flow of information on campus, and the threatening language we saw last week adds nothing to civil discourse. To be clear, we stand by our reporting. We are not retracting our news story or our separate editorial on Pride’s decision, both published Sept. 27. To do so would be to reject our long-standing commitment to publishing articles relevant to the student body and greater Rice community. We are a news organization, and we report on the news. Our issue last week, like any other week, was reflective of this. We do want to clear up some of the misconceptions that have swirled around our reporting recently. Namely, there’s a difference between our news story and our editorial on Pride’s decision. The former is an impartial report on the facts of the matter that incorporated multiple perspectives, from both Pride and Houston Hillel; the latter is an opinionated statement from our editorial board, reached in consensus and written together. More broadly, in an increasingly digital age, misinformation and inflammatory rhetoric are their most rampant. There is a visible decline in capability for public discourse. We need unbiased, objective journalism to combat misinformation, but that’s rendered largely useless when it’s not accessible to readers. Unfortunately, media literacy on campus and beyond is at a worrying low. If we as a community are to promote the open exchange of relevant information, it requires every single one of us to try to comprehend the situations we are placed in. Journalists — the Thresher included — follow long-standing codes of ethics; we adhere to theSociety of Professional Journalists’. It is important for all of us to understand the difference between unethical journalism and a story we simply disagree with. We encourage you to read SPJ’s code of ethics, and to look back to them when you find an article troubling. By no means are we asking that you refrain from criticizing us. Your feedback is important — it sounds cliché, but it truly makes us better. We’re not professionals and we welcome any opportunity to learn from our mistakes. We will continue to report on stories relevant to Rice. We will continue to engage with you, fellow members of the community, in striving for accurate and diverse journalism and in creating a space where everyone can share their voice.

crimson_2023_91,"Our collective lack of sleep shows readily across campus. People nap in chairs, or even on the library floor, to catch much-needed shuteye before they return to the grind. Our culture of poor sleep habits isn’t new, but in recent years, Harvard has come up with some novel solutions to tackle it. In September 2018, for the first time, the Collegerequired incoming freshmento complete an online training module prior to their arrival on campus about sleeping habits and their effects on other areas of life. In other ways, too, it seems that students are becoming more aware of the importance of sleep. There is even a General Education class on sleep taught by leading researchers. I’ve taken the GenEd and completed all my required training modules, but those haven’t been enough to solve the lack of sleep on campus. I’ve come away convinced that we need better ways to promote sleep for students. Put simply: Harvard needs nap pods. Nap pods are furniture designed to enable people to sleep comfortably in any place — a corporate office, a hospital lobby, or a library at a university like ours. Not only do nap pods suit our busy schedules well; our schedules demand them. Research suggests that naps, even as short as 20 minutes, mayincrease energy levels and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. For most of us, 20 minutes is all we can muster during a busy weekday. Aren’t there simpler solutions to our sleep woes? In theory, the College could reduce class workload or remove anti-sleep rules in study spaces like the Smith Center. The first of these options, however, is particularly unfeasible; reducing class workload is perhaps the greatest pipe dream of them all. Students are naturally ambitious. Whether it’s classes or clubs, something is always taking up our time. And because we pay the same tuition regardless of how many classes we take, we are incentivized to bulk up our course load every semester. Removing anti-sleep rules at Smith or other common spaces is unlikely to be sufficient, either. It would be a step in the right direction (and, in some ways, requisite for introducing nap pods , but students should benefit from the best tools available to help them rest, as with any other educational device. Nap pods offer students a level of privacy that generic couches do not. And because they are intended only for sleeping, in contrast to generic couches, the College could ensure thorough and frequent cleaning between occupants. Other universities seem to recognize the value in nap pods. Institutions like Stanford University, the University of Miami, Wesleyan University, and Washington State University have installed sleeping pods in libraries and other places around campus. The University of Akron, in particular, offers a feasible model for integrating nap pods into study spaces. The university set up four nap pods in three different study places, allowing students to use them for 20-minute refresher naps throughout the day. The school seems to have recognized that sleep itself is a crucial aspect of wellbeing, in all senses of the word. Nap pods can be understood as cutting-edge mental health equipment, and providing this equipment to all students, not only select groups like student-athletes, is laudable. Harvard has a unique opportunity to make investments in its students’ physical and mental wellbeing. Nap pods have shown to facilitatepromising improvementsto alertness and energy levels for healthcare workers on long shifts, and there’s no reason to suspect that their effect would be anything different at Harvard. The College should look for nap pod manufacturers with which to partner on a pilot program. It wouldn’t be the first. San Diego nap pod manufacturer HOHM partnered with the University of Ohio Cleveland Medical Center in 2020 to deliver two free sleep stations. Though some university administrators may deem nap pods an inefficient use of money, our student body is small enough, and the university’s coffers large enough, to make our sweet dreams a reality. Sleep is too crucial to be overshadowed by every other priority in the life of a busy undergraduate. Sleeping inadequately is associated with severe physical and cognitive consequences, a reality that does not spare ambitious students. A2014 analysisshowed that the best independent predictors of injuries among student-athletes in Los Angeles were hours of sleep per night and grades in school, with students averaging less than eight hours of sleep almost twice as likely to suffer an injury as those who averaged eight or more — a sobering fact for the hundreds of student athletes on Harvard’s campus. Other documented effects include decreased attention spans, impaired cognitive development, and an increased propensity towards risky behaviors. The reality is that students don’t sleep as much as they need to. Instead of hoping the problem will fix itself, it’s time for Harvard to take action to bring students what they need: nap pods.

thetech_mit_2023_11,"Dear fellow graduate student workers, On Friday, February 17, 2023, members of various campus communities at MIT - the Black Graduate Students Association (BGSA , the Latinx Graduate Student Association (LGSA , LGBTQ Grad, the DEI Committee of the Graduate Student Council (GSC DEI , and current student alums of the MIT Summer Research Program - sat across the bargaining table from various MIT administrators and lawyers hired to represent MIT. We shared powerful, emotional, and brutally honest statements presenting our own and fellow students’ experiences facing harassment, discrimination, and bullying at MIT. To deal with incidents of harassment and discrimination like this, the institute currently presents Institute Harassment and Discrimination Response (IDHR as the only path for recourse, stating that it is indeed trusted by the grad population. How can this be the case when a survey run by the Association of American Universities reports that 39.4% of grad students reported experiencing harassing behavior, yet less than 1% utilized IDHR? Speaking to fellow grad workers from our various communities, the reasons WHY they don’t trust IDHR vary - the NDA before a mediated conversation; the inherent bias of MIT having final say on the resolution at the end of the process; the process itself feeling isolating & burdensome to the person in need of a resolution. Further, IDHR only covers cases of protected class, which means it does not cover cases of power-based harassment, more commonly called bullying. As workers who depend on the institute and PIs for employment and livelihood, grad workers are in a position of vulnerability that demands that we be supported by a fair and comprehensive grievance process covered under this contract. When presented with grad workers’ experiences at the Institute, why grad workers may not trust and/or utilize the IDHR process, and why an alternative may serve us better, MIT admin met us with excuses and invalidation. The MIT administration may try to represent proceedings as collegial and collaborative, or state they value belonging and community. But once again, their words and reality don’t match up. We are demanding that the MIT admin agrees to a process for harassment, discrimination, and bullying that grad workers can trust will result in real recourse. To guarantee an equitable and respectful workplace, we deserve a fair and empowering union grievance procedure that includes: The right to file grievances about bullying, identity-based harassment and discrimination, thereby empowering workers to address and seek recourse for these mistreatments; A clear, fair, process for handling misconduct which prioritizes improving the well-being of the student; The right to the full support of our union, including a trained, experienced, and legally protected union steward at the grad worker’s side through the entire conflict resolution procedure, so that no one has to navigate these problems alone; and The right to escalate adjudication to a third-party neutral arbitrator (not an Institute-affiliated group if cases cannot be resolved through mutual discussion If you wish to support these demands to build a more fair and welcoming MIT for graduate students, please sign your or your student group’s name in the attachedform.

crimson_2023_68,"The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is consistently failing us as students. Themove to previous-term registrationis the latest such failure. The manifest problems with previous-term registration have already been eloquently articulated by faculty members. “The idea that students can make good informed choices about the next term before they have seen the last third of their current courses would already seem somewhat farfetched,” professor Marianna K. Linz ’11told The Crimsonin October. “Add midterms to the mix and it is hard to imagine they will be able to put in the amount of time reading the Q and talking to friends that they could at a less busy time.” I agree with her wise insight. Why would administrators, well aware of these issues, forge ahead with previous-term registration? There seems to be a clear pattern of Harvard administrators consistently and disingenuously choosing to put themselves before students. It seems to me that previous-term course registration was never really about helping students, but about helping FAS bureaucrats and faculty members streamline course planning without regard to how it would complicate the lives of busy students in the thick of midterm season. The FAS making sweeping, time-saving changes at the expense of students is nothing new. As the FAS decided to move to previous-term registration in the spring of 2022, it also chose to strip students of shopping week — a move that was likewise protested by students and prominent faculty members for eliminating students’ flexibility to explore a wide range of courses. This year, the Harvard CollegeDean of Students Office announcedthat it “will not recognize newly formed student organizations for the 2023-24 academic year.” The College admits students, in part, for their “leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities.” Depriving students of the opportunity to lead the College forward in new extracurricular pursuits is, in my view, detestable. To justify this decision, the DSO cited insufficient resources to support the current number of clubs, claiming the freeze would enable “a thorough assessment of the independent student engagement environment on Harvard’s campus.” I certainly understand the difficulty of supporting a large number of student organizations. But at the same time,the FAS reporteda $84.9 million surplus for the 2022 fiscal year and has tens of millions or more available in unrestricted funds. The FAS clearly has the capability to direct tens — or even hundreds — of thousands of dollars toward the resources that the DSO allegedly needs. Instead, it chose to disallow new student organizations. As with previous-term registration, it seems this choice was driven not by necessity but convenience. Rather than allocating resources to support students, the College capitulated. These events, in my mind, are a flagrant display of dishonesty. Does the FAS simply not care about students’ ability to freely pursue novel extracurricular activities? And is it at all surprising that a College spokesperson declined to comment to The Crimson on student criticism? I am convinced that the FAS simply does not care what students think. To its credit, the College is — like any good fiction author — consistent with its story. This week,the College cut funding for HoCos by five percent, claiming that the decision resulted in part from “an increase in students opting out of paying the student activities fee.” Again, the College recycles the tale of insufficient resources. In the face of the FAS’s budget surplus, this claim strains believability. With millions of discretionary dollars at its disposal, the FAS should not need to cut funding because revenue from the student activities fee is down. In the broader picture of the Faculty’s budget, the money taken from HoCo’s is hardly more than a rounding error — literally. The FAS’s financial statements round to the hundred thousand, while all the HoCos combined received $204,250 for the next fiscal year. In light of this, it is hard to see this cut as anything but a choice to prioritize administrative convenience over student life. What does the FAS find money for instead?Fat salariesand big raises for top administrators. Go figure. Ian M.

rice_thresher_2023_8,"ByWill Nunnery11/14/23 10:49pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. As Rice has been struggling for the past few weeks with our culture around alcohol and public gatherings, Speakeasy Pub last Thursday night has shown us that a safe, responsible and fun drinking environment is still very possible. Sure, the 21+ age limit hurts inclusion, and I feel for those who wanted to attend but couldn’t, but it did work to create a much safer crowd with easy movement around the room; even the officers from Rice University Police Department working that night were visibly more at ease with the event. The event saw no medical calls or excessive mess, and as I walked around and said, “Hi” to everyone I knew, it seemed to be one of the most thoroughly enjoyed Pub nights for many in recent years. Much to the credit of the musicians and Pub staff, our little bar in a basement was finally transformed into something that made so much sense for it to be. There is something to be said about the classy yet casual atmosphere that comes with a proper speakeasy, as it made even me, an ordinarily staunchly anti-alcohol person, extremely comfortable approaching the bar and trying something new. Meeting new people and catching up with friends was easier, and if you just wanted to sit down and listen to music, you were more than welcome to do so. I feel for those who will miss publics and those who enjoy the loud, mosh-style parties that Pub often has, but Speakeasy Pub has brought Rice a new possibility to expand our diversity of social environments and increase the quality of student life. Such an environment also lends itself to a controlled, low-liability event whose shutdown the Rice administration would have a harder time justifying. The last piece of this puzzle is profitability for Pub itself, which I imagine is more of a final determinant to see if we see Speakeasy Pub continue. Still, I hope that in some way, everyone who enjoyed their night and would like to see a similar shift in culture will continue to show their support to Pub or any other campus organization that can make it happen. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month.

state_press_2023_44,"Every year, ASU reaches a new record high in enrollment. Yet, Arizona faces a consistent decline in the rate of high school graduates attending college. Illustration created Oct. 6,2022. In a time when ambiguity is at the forefront of college admissions, ASU s increasingly transparent expectations for incoming freshmen are revolutionary. If the nation s higher education institutions want to rebuild trust in their admissions processes, ASU s recent initiative should be its blueprint. ASU sentearly acceptance lettersto over 1,450 Phoenix Union High School District students last year – before they even opened the ASU application portal. The cohort had received letters since ninth grade, informing them they either met ASU s admissibility requirements or were close to meeting them. ASU also notified sophomores and juniors of how many required courses they had already completed and how many more they needed to be admissible. Receiving that letter as a high school student gave Samantha Muñoz, a freshman studying nursing, a sense of validation after years of hard work. It was super nice to feel recognized, being a low-income student, she said. It was cool to see that everybody (at school was getting the same opportunity. Muñoz said ASU s campaign plays a big role in helpingPhoenix Union High School Districtstudents consider college as a viable option. In the community where I come from, not many of our parents have attended college, so it s very shocking to receive this recognition, Muñoz said. But it is definitely helpful to understand that you are being recognized and it is possible to go to college no matter your income. This year, the University has expanded its partnership to include 11 more districts, with the ultimate goal of reaching all Arizona schools. Being able to reach every qualified student in Arizona would be phenomenal, said Matthew López, executive director of Admission Services at ASU. The whole hope is to get more students excited about going to college. The multiyear campaign can potentially expand to younger students, setting them up for postsecondary success earlier on. The hope is that we can start with eighth graders and give them insight into what it takes to be admissible, give them the tools and resources to understand what financial aid assistance would be available to them, López said. So then when it comes to their senior year, all of their effort manifests into saying you know what? I m going to university. ASU s partnership with school districts allows the University to actually encourage high school students to apply, even if college wasn t previously on their radar. This is in stark contrast to thefar from straightforwardpractices of most universities. Even colleges that accept a majority of its applicants, such as UA, do not engage with prospective students to such an extent. By clarifying the admissions process for students, ASU breaks away from this closed-off mold of American higher education, revealing a new, more inclusive role universities can take on in its communities. Sending out personalized letters to students explaining its progress pulls back the curtain from a needlessly shrouded admissions process, giving aspiring ASU students a clear and pragmatic way to meet enrollment requirements. ASU s campaign stands out by showing how universities can make admissions work for students instead of against them, demonstrating a commitment to inclusive and student-centric practices. It s time for universities across the country to do the same.

crimson_2023_87,"“Who cares about all these student government elections?” This apathetic sentiment has seemingly become commonplace in recent years. It makes sense: The Harvard Undergraduate Association is a student government so chaotic it found itselfthe center of student criticismonly a week into this academic year. There’s just one problem with the otherwise blissful ignorance of pretending the HUA doesn’t exist: club funding. I’m not here to talk about clubs’ contentious food budgets or private events. It’s hard to see these disputes as anything but a sideshow when the clubs themselves are not accessible to low-income students. As a part of Harvard’s frustratingly smalllow-income student body, my tuition and room and board are completely covered by need-based financial aid. But I still found that I needed to work a part-time job on the side. The truth is, no matter what low-income students do, a full ride will never be quite enough to meet all of our needs; even if I manage to make it to the dining hall on time for every meal, never get injured or sick, avoid traveling anywhere I can’t walk, and cut every last hobby out of my life, I’d still have to pay for textbooks. In fact, the College appears well aware of these expenses: They already estimate an individual student will need $3,500 for “Personal Expenses” on financial aid documents, which they elaborate should be met with the “Student Term-Time Work Expectation.” So I secured a part-time job in Cambridge before I ever stepped foot on Harvard’s campus. I even took pride in my newfound financial independence. But one recurring question in the neverending cycle of the Harvard intro kept haunting me: “What clubs are you in?” The answer was simple: “None.” Being a full-time Harvard student and working 15 hours a week just didn’t leave time for anything but a handful of Fuerza Latina events. I was well aware that countless opportunities were passing me by, but I didn’t have a second to spare. I felt like I was hardly making the most of my time at Harvard, like all my classmates seemed to be doing. So what changed? How am I even writing this op-ed? Well, eventually, I found out that The Crimson has a need-based financial aid program for its low-income writers that pays them for their work, essentially serving as a job replacement. But The Crimson is financially independent from the College. As it stands, the College’s funding is wholly inadequate for most student groups to compensate club members for their work. The Crimson pays individual low-income members up to $1,500 per semester, while the average student group received a total of $650 from the University annuallyas of 2018— a figure that would have grown to just over $1,730 today, assuming club funding increased proportionally to thestudent activities fee. In other words, even assuming students were no less willing to pay the increased student activities fee, it would take almost the entire budget of the average student organization to pay a single member for a semester’s work, making such a proposal a non-starter under the current club funding structure — and leaving low-income students on the outside, looking in. Unsurprisingly, this has helped foster a campus culture defined by inequity: While low-income students often find themselves stuckworking low-wage jobsto meet their needs, wealthy students gain professional experience and connections in student organizations from the Institute of Politics to Harvard Undergraduate Consulting on Business and the Environment. Worse yet, this seems to create a cycle of exclusion. When low-income students are left on the outside looking in, student organizations are less likely to cater to the needs of the low-income members they do have. So, how do we fix it? On one hand, Harvard could offer further direct financial support to low-income students, providing them the same degree of autonomy wealthy students already have. But this seems highly unlikely, especially given the College’s expectation that “personal expenses” be met through term-time work. On the other hand, the College’s leadership could move to overhaul the club funding structure, ensuring that clubs — particularly those with pre-professional implications — offer pay to highly involved members. This approach is likely more palatable for an administration that seems unwilling to award financial assistance for all but the most basic living expenses. While it’s understandably easy to lose sight of the importance of club funding when it so often is devoted to nothing but merchandise, an El Jefe’s or Kung Fu Tea budget, and an occasional off-campus event, the HUA’s club funding responsibility is crucial for the accessibility of student organizations to low-income students. It can be entertaining to laugh as we watch the frenzy that ensues when we trust a group of unqualified wannabe politicians to manage hundreds of thousands of dollars, but we cannot lose sight of the serious work they are neglecting. When the stakes are as high as they are, we can’t afford to ignore the fact that an organization whose only meaningful responsibility is club funding devoted 19 percent of their $550,000 budget to expenses other than student organizations this year. Frighteningly, our student government’s lack of credibility may actively discourage students from paying the optional student activities fee. And can we really expect the College to offer the HUA truly adequate funding beyond the student activities fee whenstudents themselvesdo not trust the student government with their money? As much as I hate to say it, the HUA’s work matters. But let me be clear. When I vote in an HUA election, I’m not voting because I buy into our broken system. I’m voting because I care about the work that broken system is supposed to do. If the HUA cares about its only job, then it’s time to prove it by making a meaningful push for financial aid within student organizations. Club funding affects real people. When we pretend it doesn’t, we wind up with the completely inadequate and exclusive system we see today: Clubs for the rich, and jobs for everyone else. Joseph W. Hernandez ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Government concentrator in Adams House."
rice_thresher_2023_67,"ByXin Tan1/24/23 10:14pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Everyday, many graduate students are struggling with meals, because Rice offers very limited on-campus servery dining opportunities for them. Many students have expressed concern over this policy including Yajie Liu, a bioengineering Ph.D. student. Her day is filled with coursework, research and mentoring undergraduates in the lab. Though Yajie is on campus from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day, she enjoys her busy life. This semester, she applied for the graduate meal plan but failed to get selected. She is very disappointed and has to spend extra time and effort preparing affordable meals herself. The on-campus graduate meal plan is very important to student life, Ph.D. students in particular. Rice should expand the on-campus meal plans to cater to the demand of increasing graduate students. In 2023, Rice hosts 3998 graduate students, but the school has only provided 300 on-campus servery lunch meal plans. In total, only 1 out 12 graduate students can get this meal plan. Applying for the meal plan is now even more competitive than applying to attend Rice. Although Rice is known for undergraduate education, graduate students have played an indispensable part in the undergraduate experience. The tuition from the master’s programs has sponsored faculty hires in a number of departments. The Ph.D. students play the role of class TA and research mentorship to help undergraduates succeed. Besides, many Ph.D. students stay on campus day to night working on their own research. Allowing them to dine on campus could greatly facilitate their work and life. There is indeed a legitimate demand for all graduate students to have more dinner and lunch options on campus. For many years, the Graduate Student Association has fought to increase the on-campus dining options for graduate students. In a conversation I had with a GSA offficer, I learned that the biggest resistance to expanding graduate meal plans comes from undergraduates. A long time ago, when Rice’s graduate student body was much smaller, GSA and Student Association reached an agreement to provide a small number of meal plans to graduate students, because many undergraduates seemed to be afraid that the graduate students might ‘take over’ college commons if they have access. The number of meal plans has had a very limited increase since then. One of the main arguments against expanding meal plans is that giving graduate students access to the commons dining is equivalent to giving undergraduates free access to Ph.D. students’ offices. However, this is purely distorted thinking. Ph.D. students’ office/lab is a private work place full of research equipment, and it is analogous to the student’s dorm rather than college commons, which is a multi-purpose public space. Most importantly, there’s no incentive for graduate students to stay in the undergraduate commons beyond mealtime. Ph.D. students have their office/lab, and master’s students also have study areas in respective departments, let alone the library and student apartments. To make an analogy, the deep-off campus senior undergrads would occasionally come to campus for meals, but they would barely show up other times. Why do we assume graduate students will be more attached to undergraduate commons and take up the space more than OC students? Rice is proud of its inclusiveness, and many graduate and undergraduate students are also classmates in cross-listed courses. Nobody should feel bothered when some graduate students spend 20 minutes having a servery meal inside the commons. After all, Rice is not a liberal arts college but a research university. If both undergraduate and graduate students can share the classroom, gym room and study room, why not the dining room? The cost of living in Houston has risen a lot in the last three years, and on-campus dining in the servery is the most affordable and healthiest food option to support graduate students. Last year, Rice offered the first-ever dinner plan to graduate students via the Whoo Deli attached to South Servery, but the dining window starts at 7:45 p.m., which is significantly later than the common dining schedule in the USA. The demand of undergraduates also makes some sense. To compensate for using the commons, the school could charge an additional $0.5 for every graduate meal, and this money would go to every college government for activity funds, especially for Beer Bike & Orientation Week. If Rice could just expand the meal plan to 400 with 75 meals for both lunch and dinner, this would generate $30,000 per semester to support undergraduates’ activities. Rice undergraduates have always aspired to address global issues, and they have spent lots of effort in making on-campus dining more environmentally friendly. It shouldn’t be difficult to also address some on-campus issues and make the servery dining more graduate-friendly. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

While this letter is mostly about antisemitism at Stanford, my heart breaks for students like Abdulwahab Omira, who was targeted in a heinous hit and run attack on Nov. 3, and for all students who are targeted by hate, regardless of their race, gender, country of origin, religion or other protected status. We are all the worse for these unprovoked and destructive acts, and I send him my prayers for healing. Ever since I tore open my acceptance letter to Stanford over 40 years ago, I had felt nothing but pride in my identity as a Stanford student and alumnus. But since the brutal Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 thatkilled1,200 innocent Israeli men, women and children; took over 200 hostages and wounded thousands more, I no longer feel that way. Ironically, Hamas has relatively little to do with my change of heart. It’s what has been happening at Stanford that has left me feeling heartbroken and ashamed. In 2005, I had just arrived in Israel to begin my cantorial studies following the Gazadisengagementthat left millions of dollars worth of productive infrastructure in place for the Palestinians and thousands of Israelis uprooted — many of them forcefully removed by the IDF — with no place to live. Though compensated by the state for their losses, many Israelis camped for months in protest outside the Prime Minister’s residence, which I passed each morning on my way to class. Most people that I knew, however, felt it was a necessary step toward peace with the Palestinians. In return, Palestinian mobs destroyed most of what Israel left behind and began a relentless terror campaign consisting of tens of thousands ofindiscriminately fired rocketsfrom civilian areas towardnon-combatants and non-military structures. Every single rocket — an ingeniously designed cluster bomb of war crimes — was carefully packed with thousands of ball bearings, nails and shrapnelto do one thing: terrorize as many innocent people as possible. And so, to protect its citizens from this real and present threat on its border with Gaza, Israel instituted a blockade that continues to this day. To be clear: Palestinian terror preceded the blockade and has continued almost unabated ever since. For the most part, while the United Nations and most NGOs have endlesslydecriedthe blockade as “illegal,” it has always been, in fact, wholly defensive (read: not illegal , and kept the southern border relatively safe. Until Oct. 7. When the ASSUvotedto divest from Israeli companies but the University did not, I still felt pride. I didn’t like how misguided those students were who supported Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS , but I felt like Stanford would still be a great place to send my children one day. Even when Stanfordadmittedto using admissions quotas for Jews, I felt pride that the University was willing to shed self-critical light on its own dark past, make amends and take action to address its flaws. Fast forward to today. Life experience taught me that the support Israel experienced immediately following the Oct. 7 massacre would only last a few days, and I was right. What I did not expect, though, was that Stanford students would side with terrorists who savagelybutcheredadults, women, children and babies. I did not expectJewishStanford associate professor of history, Mikael Wolfe, to expound upon common antisemitic, anti-Israel tropes — disparaging Zionism as a “settler-colonial project” and referring to Israel’s “indiscriminate bombing,” “collective punishment” and “illegal … blockade,” among others — in his Oct. 31opinion. Specifically, “The major element of Zionism that made possible the founding of Israel,” he asserts, “was theexpulsionof 750,000 Palestinians from their homes during the first major Arab-Israeli War in 1948.” While there are legitimate criticisms against Israel that are not considered antisemitic, Wolfe’s claims place the entire blame for the displacement of the Palestinian Arabs in 1948 on Israel. This is so devoid of context that the best that can be said about it is that it was woefully irresponsible. I did not expect that The Daily would publish that opinion without fact-checking an “expert” who should know the history of his own people better. I also didn’t expect that The Daily would blithely publish student demonstrators’ propaganda about the75-year “occupation” of Palestinewithout bothering to note that 75 years encompasses Israel’s entire existence. But most of all, I didn’t expect the University administration, led for the first time in its history by a Jew, to allow unbridled antisemitism in the form of anti-Israel propaganda (see 3 Ds Test below to stampede its way through Stanford’s classrooms and public spaces. Israel isn’t perfect and deserves to be criticized. But if the U.N.-acceptedworking definitionof antisemitism put forth by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance is silent on whether criticism of Israel is antisemitic, how do we know when we’ve crossed the line from legitimate criticism to antisemitism? How do we know there evenisa line at all? Natan Sharansky, a former Soviet dissident, human rights activist and one-time Chairman of the Jewish Agency, after a lifetime of observing modern day antisemitism around the world, proposed a very simple formula for recognizing when otherwise legitimate criticism of Israel devolves into antisemitism. He calls it theThree Ds Test. The first D stands for double-standards. Let’s start with one of the favorite canards of Israel’s detractors: genocide. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, genocide isdefinedprimarily as including “violent attacks with the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.” Guided by this internationally-accepted definition, can we build a case that Israel has been committing genocide against the Palestinians or not? The Palestinianpopulationin 1950 stood at 944,087. As of today, Palestinians number more than 5.4 million. While the suffering and devastation from the current conflict in Gaza are heart-rending, based on this stunning statistic alone, the charge that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians is completely counterfactual and patently absurd. But real-world facts that challenge their hallowed narrative haven’t prevented the U.N., most NGOs, media outlets, governments around the world,academics, social justiceactivistsof allstripes,celebritiesand, yes, even our own Stanford students from incessantly declaring that Israel is committing genocide while they simultaneously ignore the very real genocides that have taken millions of innocentEthiopian,Syrian,Sudanese,Rwandan,Yemenitelives and thousands more in recent years. Such charges are intellectually lazy, downright ignorant and evidence of an obvious and pernicious double standard toward Israel. The second D is for delegitimization. Israel has fought multiple defensive wars against existential threats and has been in a constant state of war with most of its neighbors since the day it was founded. In every case — 1948, 1967, 1973, 2023 —Israel was attacked first and responded in self-defense, winning each of those wars and gaining territory in the process. Yet Israel is expected to just give it all up, whether it be Gaza and the West Bank, the Golan or, indeed, the entire land of Israel. When you label Israel, a U.N. member nation, a settler colonial state and question Israel’s right to exist (whether on legal or moral grounds , you are guilty of delegitimization. The final D is demonization. When Stanford studentsadoptterrorist slogans by chanting “long live the Intifada” and relentlessly accuse Israel of imperialism, settler colonialism, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, genocide and apartheid, they not only don’t know what those terms actually mean, they are demonizing Israel. Double-standards, delegitimization and demonization: These are the three hallmarks of modern-day antisemitism masquerading as anti-Israel criticism. I honestly believe that many people who chant “from the river to the sea” are not antisemitic. They just really want peace. I would simply remind them that what happened on Oct. 7 is but a small taste of how their dream would devolve into an unimaginable nightmare if Israel were to lay down its arms. It would be a real genocide, but not of the Palestinians. Of millions of Jews. Again. To paraphrase the late Lord Rabbi Jonathan Sacks from a keynote speech he delivered to the European Parliament in 2016 entitled “Understanding Antisemitism: The Mutating Virus,” it is not antisemitic to not like Jews. Nor is it antisemitic to not like Israel. But when anti-Zionists categorically deny the legitimate right of Jews to live as Jews in their own land, and lend their voices to those who actively seek the destruction of the Jewish state — especially when claiming to defend human rights — then they are, indeed, guilty of antisemitism. And so, for the first time in my life, rather than the unabashed pride I have always felt as a member of the Stanford family, I feel ashamed. I am ashamed of students who would threaten their fellow students andadvocatefor the destruction of the Jewish homeland and all its people, and I am ashamed of the University for allowing such blatant hate to proliferate on campus under the guise of legitimate public discourse and by hiding behind theLeonard Law. Most of all, though, I am ashamed of myself for not advocating on behalf of Stanford’s Jewish students sooner. Stanford studentsdeservebetter than this. Stanford students shouldbebetter than this.

state_press_2023_13,"ASU sophomore Gabrielle Wallace using ChatGPT in the Downtown Phoenix campus Library on Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2023. ASU s nonspecific guidelines for artificial intelligence usage in the classroom is a savvy move as institutions across the country grapple with the emergence of ChatGPT. By leaving the terms of AI and ChatGPT usage open, professors can provide leeway to courses that could benefit from it or prohibit AI in courses where it s a liability. Since ChatGPT s release in late November 2022, institutions are struggling to find the balance between maintaining academic integrity and exploring the potential of AI. Thecurrent guidelinespermitacademic units and/or faculty to determine whether student use of generative AI/ChatGPT in their courses is permitted or prohibited. This flexibility lets AI positively influence different facets of research, learning, teaching and administration. The University plans to positively employ generative AI technologies to enhance learner outcomes, said ASU spokesperson Veronica Sanchez in an emailed statement. Andrew Maynard, a professor for theSchool for the Future of Innovation in Society, teaches ASU sfirst courseon developing professional skills using ChatGPT. I m a strong advocate of developing innovative ways of using AI to enhance learning and to make learning more accessible to more people — all while being very aware of the potential pitfalls of using AI in education, Maynard said. This course, called Basic Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT, has been structured and designed by ChatGPT itself. The course teaches students how to make the most out of ChatGPT as a resource. AI has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in education today, the Office of the University Provost said in astatement. Nonetheless, as educators and students, we face a new frontier as we navigate a world in which the distinction between content generated by AI and humans is rapidly blurring. While AI has potential to positively guide and support academics at ASU, ChatGPT and other chatbots must be used responsibly. Critics point to increased risks of cheating and integrity violations as a deterrent to allowing AI in the classroom. However, academic integrity violations have always been a risk regardless of the presence or absence of this technology. READ MORE:How ASU and its faculty are cracking down on dishonest uses of AI Kena Ray, assistant director at the Instructional Design and Learning Technology program, said students who intend to plagiarize or break other ethical codes will always find a way to do it. Ray said AI should help the University reach its academic goals rather than be a hindrance or liability. The benefits of artificial intelligence – streamlining workflows and improving efficiency – must be balanced with the human elements that are indispensable for scholarly pursuits, Ray said. There are no AI detectiontools currently set in place at ASU. Ray said the University is not planning to institute these tools any time soon because they are unreliable. As ASU and other universities navigate the AI landscape, granting more flexibility is the best approach. We need to learn how to use (AI responsibly and innovatively to positively scale our impact as an institution, all while understanding and learning how to successfully navigate potential pitfalls, Maynard said. ASU’s current guidelines offer this understanding. They give faculty and students enough adaptability to explore AI as an educational tool that could enrich the learning experience instead of detracting from it.

stanforddaily_2023_6,"In the “Black Mirror” episode“Hang the DJ”, love seekers find themselves in many simulated worlds, where each world calculates the probability of them falling in love with someone they meet in the virtual world if they choose to break out of the world. In another episode,“Nosedive”that satirizes social media use, people rank each other and can immediately see the scores of others when they first meet. The two episodes seem absurdly dystopian, but a combination of the two episodes — Checkmate — has already announced its arrival in our world. Checkmateis a new product of the popular college dating app,the Marriage Pact, and it uses algorithms to calculate the matching score between two individuals. Like participating in the Marriage Pact, people would first answer some questions that reveal some parts of their personality and values, then scan someone, and AI would calculate their “long-term odds together,” as itclaims. Since before the Marriage Pact season in 2022, the company has been experimenting with Checkmate as one of the lab projects, along with“Soulmate Radar”(which is an app that sends users notifications when the potential love of their life passes by . I first joined the beta to help develop Checkmate over the summer. Every day, I received an email from Marriage Pact with a “question of the day” — the kind of questions that would appear on the Marriage Pact questionnaire. At first, I found the questions entertaining, and the notification I received at the same time in the morning even became my source of refuge, something that I would click into to remind myself that my inbox has fun emails too — it’s not all deadlines and ads. A few months later, however, the questions bored me. The same, random questions about my preferences no longer seemed to show me more about myself, and even the graph showing a distribution of responses ceased bringing me the surprise of knowing whether I was the outlier. If Checkmate existed in a movie, we as reviewers would relentlessly condemn its stupidity and naivety, another example of the dystopian imagination, just like“Coach”from “Hang the DJ” and“Rate Me”from “Nosedive.” However, when a product like Checkmate entered our world and our campus at Stanford immediately after Marriage Pact matches were released in the fall, the zeal could not hide itself. In early December, many Stanford students downloaded the app and asked more of their friends to answer questions so they could see each other’s scores. The excitement was contradictory: while we debated AI ethics, envisioned the future of AI in all aspects and mocked the impossibility of products like Checkmate, we became so drawn to it. During early December, Checkmate was the topic of conversations and was often the first thing students checked when seeing their friends — to see whether the score is reflective of their friendships and whether it went up after answering more questions. I never got a very high score with anyone, but there were people who had multiple 99.9% matches. So what do these scores say about us? How did they make us feel? How are they changing our interactions with friends and new people? I even got a 2% match with a friend, so what does the score say about our compatibility in real life? As much as each of us understood the lack of depth in each number, we became dependent on it. Each of us tried to give meaning to the numbers, to add depth and reasons behind the final result that seemed telling about our relationships, frantically finding explanations for each score. They were just numbers, yet we wanted them to define us. The power in the simplicity of numbers is seductive. The numbers could have been completely random, yet we tried so hard to make sense of them and force stories onto them. Another common concern around the use of technology and AI in something uniquely human (marriage, friendships, etc. is privacy. While Marriage Pact hasnot leaked any private datayet, Checkmate poses another threat to privacy — something each user must have noticed but not discussed. When we use the app, we also have access to matching scores with our friends and everyone else they matched with, whether we have added the third person or not. I could not only see how I matched with my friends but can also compare our score with my friends’ other scores. We basically get an outsider peek at other relationships that we may otherwise not be aware of, although none asked for this disclosure. The craze around Checkmate did not last long. Before finals season of fall quarter, Checkmate soon disappeared from the stage, now sitting quietly on our smartphone homescreens. Just a couple of days ago, I received a notification telling me that “Leslie just joined Checkmate! Scan to see your compatibility with her. eye emoji .” The eye emoji is ironic: if we scan the score, many other users will receive a notification, saying that I scored 95% with Leslie. Most would be entertained, while some would be jealous that they did not get an equally high score. Either way, we arebeing watched. No one talks about Checkmate anymore, as if it is a transient dream that came and left. But when we wake up from the dream, we realize that it had been a nightmare all along. Checkmate is not forgotten, but left behind in our memories as ChatGPT, Bing, and other products of artificial intelligence posed more alarming threats. We cannot deny that during the days that Checkmate was around, there was an unsettling fervor, one that we could not repress, and it reveals something about us. Our response to the Checkmate app shows at least some things about us: first, no matter how many classes we take on AI ethics or how many dystopian movies we watch, we cannot resist the enticement of algorithms that turn large data and personal information into forms of conclusions about who we are and what our relationships look like. We are curious about ourselves, and we are curious about technology, which is why products like Checkmate can be a shortcut satisfying our desire for self-knowledge. Our interaction with Checkmate shows that one day we may easily repeat scenes in past dystopian imaginations without even realizing it. Our initial response to Checkmate, one characterized by zeal and fervor, is an alarming warning for our future reliance on AI. On the other hand, the quick outdatedness of Checkmate also shows that simple, misleading numbers are not enough to lure us. We are still hungry for novelty, excitement and new information. It is a part of our nature. What has been imagined by “Black Mirror” and discussed by us is already here, but we have not been talking enough about it. What if one day a biomedical company invents a happiness-inducing drug that becomes prevalent, just like soma in “Brave New World”? What if virtual amusement parks where humans interact with robots (violently and dangerously becomes the new destination for fun, just like what happens in “Westworld”? We might not even realize that writer Aldous Huxley warned us againstsomadecades before when he discusses happiness in his dystopian novel, and that Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan imagined and feared “Westworld,” a world where violent delights have violent ends. Then, it will be too late to realize that we are trapped."
crimson_2023_48,"Over Thanksgiving break, my brother tried to explain to me how fantasy football works. You want each of the players on your team to get lots of points. When you watch football games, you aren’t just following the ball, letting the athletes battle it out, and hoping the better strategy will carry the day. Instead, you are keeping an eye out for each reception, passing yard, and rush, hoping you’ll see higher numbers next to smiling avatars in the little app on the mobile phone you carry around in your pocket. This may sound perplexing (I am still somewhat perplexed , but if you are a Harvard student in 2023, you already get the gist. We are the avatars for thousands of players who are keeping score. They notch points when we raise flags, go viral, sign statements, get owned. They write articles and retweet and protest by the gates. The numbers climb. The avatars keep smiling. A Harvard friend recently told me that going here is just not worth it. Even if you’re dead set on elite higher education, there’s always Princeton University or Yale University — just as elite but with fewer newscasters on your walk to Ec10 (or equivalent . In a sense, she was right: Campus discourse is constantly hijacked by attention from the outside. It seems students opine to a faraway audience rather than discuss amongst themselves, sounding out new ideas and untested viewpoints the way college students are supposed to. The closed Yard, the ID checks, the helicopters hovering overhead — they all add fuel to a culture in which our ideological divisions feel threatening rather than generative. I agree with my friend: The Harvard fishbowl makes it far harder to talk about the issues that matter most. The constant pressure we feel from the outside — sometimes in the form ofharassing, personal attacks— nudges us to internalize our viewpoints as part of our identity. Is it any wonder that students facing a doxxing campaign may then interpret any response to their ideas as an attack against them? At the same time, we’re made to feel even more like victims, as outside supporters portray their side’s views asunder siegeon Harvard’s campus. This has real effects: Instead of turning to peers to refine our own and each other’s ideas, many of us feel unsafe and turn to grown-ups for support. This delegation of disagreement has done terrible things to our ability to engage in constructive discourse. When we perceive discussion as literally threatening, it’s no wonder that dialogue suffers. But besides transferring to some quieter place, I wonder what we can do with this state of affairs. It would be wrong to close off Harvard to outside observers. First of all, nobody has ever said Harvard needs to be more of an ivory tower or do a better job at being exclusive and out of reach. So let’s not. Second of all, we are, for better or for worse, a public commodity. Like the United States president or Sesame Street or Granny Smith apples, Harvard the symbol belongs to the American discourse, and if the discourse uses us as a political football, then a football we are. Instead of seeking privacy, I hope we can start by reflecting on why people feel so strongly about seeing their opinions reflected on our campus. Harvard seeks to create the leaders of the future, but it seems the world expects us to start leading even now. People care what we say not only because they anticipate we will become presidents, CEOs, or entrepreneurs, but also because Harvard itself is a leader. This shouldn’t come as a surprise — when we chose Harvard, perhaps we even looked forward to the platform. No matter the circumstance, I hope we will see ourselves as players, not avatars. If every quarterback were to aim only to maximize their fantasy backers’ profits, say, by making as many passes as possible instead of attempting only to win, football would be (even more of a really boring and weird game. But football isn’t about accruing points in odd ways to bump up virtual teams’ standing in an algorithm — it’s about hard work and raw talent combining to showcase the heights of human achievement. In our discourse, too, we mustn’t look merely to score points. When we focus on complaining about our opponents’ tactics, pull publicity stunts to try to get our faces in the news, and shut down our opponents rather than engage, we miss out on the meaningful, ideas-based discourse we could create instead. I hope, then, that we won’t allow ourselves to become fantasy football players. Our discourse will be better if we step onto the field and forget the fishbowl. Yona T.

wildcat_arizona_2023_7,"Thrifting has become a popular way to purchase clothes, primarily by young people, but by other generations as well. The act of thrifting itself is great, as it is cheap and beneficial to the environment. With its growing popularity, sites like Depop, Poshmark and other independent resellers have begun to thrive, as they are used for reselling thrifted clothing, usually at a higher price. While this seems like a convenient and good side hustle, it is also unethical and contributes to the gentrification of fashion. Thrifting clothing has become popular among Generation Z for various reasons. For one, it allows young people to express themselves in unique clothing items that have not been seen before. This allows for them topostthese outfits on social media, embracing creative and vintage looks. Thrifting is also sustainable, as itreducesconsumption, limits waste and contributes to lowering chemical pollution. Further, it offers an affordable outlet for struggling people and communities to purchase adequate clothing and positively impacts ourfinancialwell-being. These benefits conflict with the downsides and reality of reselling clothing. While Depop has a sustainability plan, the plan claims that they wish to offset their shipping emissions through implementing100% renewableoffices. The plan also suggests Depop is aware that its shipping produces a large amount of emissions, however, it fails to mention if it has enoughconsumer datato achieve this goal through its renewable offices. If Depop is unable to achieve this, it is essentially greenwashing its customers into thinking it is a sustainable platform. Additionally, selling thrifted clothes for a higher price takes away an affordable outlet for low-incomecommunitieswhere thrifting is a necessity. Many people donate their items to a thrift store for the purpose ofhelpingthose in need, not to have them bought and resold for a profit. It is also important to note that thrifting goes further than simply purchasing clothing, as thrifting furniture and appliances is also common. Low-income communities rely on these essential items as well, and taking this away is unethical and greedy. A narrative around sites like Depop and Poshmark is that it also limits the concept of fast-fashion and overconsumption. However, with this growing thrifting and resale market, overconsumption is still an issue, as the secondhand market is expected to grow from $30 billion to $77 billion by2025. Reselling for a profit is simply becoming another form of fast-fashion, as demand will continue to increase for thrifted clothing items, only driving the price higher. Between raising the prices of affordable items and clothing, and greenwashing the public about sustainable practices, sites like Depop are encouraging thegentrificationof fashion. The secondhand market cannot expect to hold fast-fashion and other mainstream fashion industries accountable for sustainability and accessibility if they cannot do any better. Sellers on Depop and other sites need to be aware of this and realize how their actions are unethical and potentially hurting others. There are many other side hustles these individuals can do to make money that are not harmful, and the act of hurting low-income communities needs to stop.

Amid this intractable landscape, we, as members of the Rice community, must feel compelled to ask ourselves: In seeking to mitigate regional anguish, areretributiveorreconciliatorymeans ofresolutionmore desirable?Does it matter? As people of conscience, we must critically evaluate whether thepursuit of retributionand thesuppression of dissentperpetuate thede factocycle of violence. Instead, we must consider the adoption of non-violentmeansto attaindesirableoutcomes that acquiesce to thesupremacy of human rights. This shift only amplifies the need toneutralizeperformative tactics ofcensorshipanddeceit, and embrace a collective stand to the antagonistic forces ofantisemitismandanti-Muslimbigotry. Only in doing so can we restrain the generational pandemic of inhumanity from within the hedges. Let me reiterate whom I implicate: the egregiously partial media, public figures and political constituents who are culpable through inaction. Destabilizingrhetoricpredicated on prejudice, intolerance and sectarianism must be unequivocally repudiated; conversely, we should refrain from inadvertently conflating such acts as an implicit endorsement of retaliatory violence. Within the Rice community, the challenge to foster productive dialogue in the public arena that can withstand the weight of contention and complexity stands. This necessitates incorporating diverse perspectives in academic discourse and facilitating forums for civil debate to encourage critical yet empathetic engagement to resist interpreting the anguish of war asfait accompli. Recognizing that our tendency towardpolarizationis often innatelyemotionalin nature, our primary defense today lies in our willpower. We must extricate ourselves from the devices of division in pursuit of embracing a common humanity. Relinquishing the superficial divisions imposed upon our societies, we must learn not just to avoid hate, but to ascertainconsensus ad idem— that you are not the “others” enemy, nor are they yours. The fabric of unity and civil discourse is fractured when emotional vulnerabilities triumph rationality. This serves only our adversaries, newly enabled and emboldened, who prioritize scapegoating and xenophobia. Now, for the sake of humanity, we must condemn war’s explicit apologists as well as their latent conspirators in this country. It is imperative to stand united with all innocent victims of indiscriminate violence. Most importantly, we cannot afford to allow globalwelfareto suffer the consequences of our own inaction, in a world wherede factochecks and balances on violence are often subverted to notions of political and personal expediency. It is my sincerest hope that the Rice community can transcend the limitations of hatred and emerge united on the side of humanity. Let us be among those who cooperate for the betterment of the world and not its destruction. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.

thetech_mit_2023_3,"The MIT Jewish community huddled together in Hillel, supporting one another, as a swelling crowd loudly called for the extermination of our friends and family. Outside, the crowd was chanting “one solution, intifada revolution,” using a term whichconnotesviolent uprising against Jews and thereby implying that the brutal murder of Israeli civilians is anything other than morally abhorrent terror. To say that I felt unsafe would be a gross understatement of the fear and horror I experienced as a group of students from the university which I have chosen to call my home supported violent, indiscriminate attacks against the home of my people. For those who are not yet aware, a few weeks ago, Hamas, anIran-backedterror group, murdered over 1,400 Israeli civilians and kidnapped 222 hostages in a single day. This terrorist attack, which targeted women, children, and the elderly, constituted the biggest loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust. Jewish communities all over the globe are still reeling from the unprecedented scale and brutality of the attacks. Many of us are reminded of the pogroms of Kristallnacht, which were smaller in scale, especially since one of the hostages is anelderly Holocaust survivor. These attacks were not legitimate acts of war, as some on this campus have unfortunately claimed (see dormspam from Oct. 8, subject line: Rally for Palestine TOMORROW: Statement and Call to Action . They were abhorrent acts of “intifada,” a word which signifies the slaughter of innocent Jewish civilians. This is not the first time Jews have heard the word “intifada”. Most recent in our memory is theSecond Intifada, a series of violent attacks against Israel in which 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis lost their lives. Although I was not in Israel during the intifada, many of my friends and family were, and they experienced trauma beyond description. To Jews with connections to Israel, the word “intifada” is associated withsuicide bombings,terrorismand thewanton loss of innocent life. As such, when Jewish students at MIT hear calls for “intifada revolution”, we cannot interpret them as anything but an active call to violence against the Jewish nation. Words gain meaning from the historical context in which they are used. In this case, the historical context is violence and terrorism in the name of resistance. Claims to the contrary are either misinformed or dishonest. As a Jew, I have experienced hate because of who I am. During my time at MIT so far, I have been inspired by the university’s commitment to combating antisemitism and helping me feel secure in my identity. That sense of belonging came crashing down as I observed the Institute’s passivity and complacence in the face of violent speech. I firmly support MIT’s deep commitment to fostering free speech on campus. The CAA has the legal and moral right to express their violent opinions, just as neo-Nazis have the right to free assembly. But, inthe wordsof MIT’s 18th president, there exists a “clear distinction between what we can say … and what we should say.” When students on campus call for attacks against Jews, MIT’s administration has a moral responsibility to state unequivocally that it does not support, and in fact abhors, such violent ideas. Sadly, MIT has failed to fulfill this responsibility. In the hours after the intifada rally, President Kornbluth released a lukewarmstatementin which she denounced all forms of hate without mentioning the CAA by name or making note of their calls to violence. We call on President Kornbluth to use her presidential voice to directly condemn these calls for violent intifada against Jews. The sun set, and the voices outside, full of anger and vitriol, continued to chant. Some of my friends took an Uber home, fearful of walking across their own campus. Many more remained, attempting to process the shock, grief, and trauma of the past few weeks. In this dark time, when it felt as if the whole world was turning against us, we somehow found solace in togetherness and community.

state_press_2023_33,"As the UCWA grows in membership and subsequently in power, the union will continue to become a more present political force on campus. The United Campus Workers of Arizona is a union representing faculty, staff and student workers at Arizona s universities, including ASU. According to itsmission statement, the union has been working to champion and defend the interests and well-being of all university workers, as well as to build and sustain social and economic justice in our workplaces and communities. With a mission statement such as this, why doesn t the University recognize and support this union? Currently, the Arizona Board of Regents recognizes university employees right to organize and states that it in no way affects their employment relationship. However, the University and ABOR don t recognize these unions for the purposes of collective bargaining. This is due to state laws that prevent them from bargaining with public sector workers, such as campus workers at the University. Because of this, UCWA is what s called awall-to-wall union. Though a wall-to-wall union cannot engage in collective bargaining, that doesn t mean there are no tools available to it. A traditional or NLRB (National Labor Relations Board union exerts a lot of its power through collective bargaining, a wall-to-wall union in a state like Arizona doesn t have recourse like that but can advocate in the public sphere and coordinate campaigns on campus together, said Alex Young, associate teaching professor, honors faculty fellow and vocal member of UCWA.

It published letters addressed to University administration protesting policies that asked for students and faculty to come back to campus in person. In addition, the union held a protest to convey this message. Unfortunately, these efforts were largely unacknowledged by the University, The State Press reported last year. Currently, UCWA is pushing two petitions.Onefocuses on increasing wages and job security for contingent faculty , andthe otherfocuses on a broad increase in the floor wages of all campus workers. Both are getting closer to their signature goals. Once they meet these goals, they will be sent to ASU President Michael Crow and ABOR. READ MORE:ASU union workers demand $25 by 2025, stronger job security According to Young, UCWA is focusing its efforts on growing its numbers and specific interventions. In the near future, it would be safe to say that it will have those numbers and be an even greater source of power in campus politics. It shouldn’t take UCWA building up enough members for there to be consequences , such as a mass protest, at the University in order for ASU administration to listen to them. If the University wants to truly demonstrate that it cares for its community and its workers, it should be listening to them now. To me, it s a win-win. Should the University start listening now, it proves it cares for its faculty, staff and student workers. When those petitions meet their goals, I hope the University will make the decision to finally acknowledge the union that represents the voice of its workers. But above all, I hope the University will not only listen to its union but also begin to advocate for it as well. Right-to-work laws, such as the ones in Arizona that bar public sector employees from collective bargaining, are blatantly anti-worker. I hope that the University will lobby to change these laws at the state level in order to allow its employees to better represent themselves and their interests.

rice_thresher_2023_47,"ByThresher Editorial Board4/4/23 9:28pm There are three certainties in life: death, taxes and Rice students claiming the most recent Beer Bike could have been better. We understand that, with this year being the first race with heats, we were essentially guinea pigs for future Beer Bikes, and we’re okay with that. But there were still some astoundingly obvious and preventable problems that need to be addressed prior to next year’s race. The most obvious of these issues was the lack of shade on and around the track — one tent way off to the side by the port-a-potties does not cut it. It’s really easy to get dehydrated and/or heat exhaustion from standing or sitting in the sun for hours on end, and it’s really not that hard to set up tents in the middle of the track and above the bleachers. Half of campus is pink this week, and there’s an obvious answer as to why. Tied directly to the issue of time in the sun is the amount of downtime between races. If heats are the way of the future — and they definitely are — then Beer Bike coordinators need to plan around the fact that the races will simply take more time. Heats need to happen in much quicker succession to one another, both to minimize time wasted in the sun, but also because it will make for a more enjoyable experience. Bikers and chuggers won’t have to sit on the track for hours, and more viewers will be willing to stay and cheer for all the races. Similarly, an easy addition that would make the races more enjoyable would be to add a big clock in the middle of the track, so spectators have a basis to compare performances between heats. Beyond logistical improvements, our current model of recruiting campus-wide coordinators does not give said coordinators the tools they need to succeed. Year after year, not only are coordinators — oftentimes sophomore students with relatively little Beer Bike experience to begin with — thrown into planning a massive campus-wide event with little support, but they typically have little to no experience looking at the pitfalls and successes of the event on a broad scale. We present a simple solution to both train more experienced campus-wide coordinators and provide more support for the existing coordinator team: junior campus coordinators. Have two student coordinators shadow and participate in campus-wide coordinating efforts with the intention of committing to being a primary campus-wide coordinator the year after. Not only would this provide direct support for the students planning the event, the incoming coordinators would have a better sense of the big picture elements of planning Beer Bike and an improved understanding of the details of the year before — what went well, what went wrong and where to go from there. Implementing junior coordinators would help bridge the knowledge gap that Beer Bike coordinators seem to encounter year after year as they each tackle the event for the first time, leaving time to effectively address critiques. Maybe with all of these improvements, we’ll have timely Beer Bike results in time to print them in the Thresher the week after — something all the more important with the heat system leaving crowds without even a rough estimate of who crossed the finish line first.

stanforddaily_2023_68,"Dear Editor, We are a group of six graduate researchers with diverse professional backgrounds and opinions on fossil fuel companies’ role in funding affiliate program research. Three of us have been actively protesting fossil fuel funding at the Doerr School. Three of us are in favor of maintaining an open dialogue with fossil fuel companies. We agree that addressing climate change is serious enough to demand a clear strategic response from the University. Working together, we have reached a consensus on recommended criteria for evaluating the sources and objectives of research funding through affiliate programs, as well as a set of actions for enforcing these criteria. We all endorse the following recommendations and we hope that they will contribute to a university-wide decision to adopt enforceable standards for research funding provided by fossil fuel companies through affiliate groups. In December of 2022, Stanford’s Office of the President established the Committee on Funding of Energy Research and Education (CFERE , charged with “exploring and reporting on the issues raised by Stanford’s accepting funding from fossil fuel companies.” The committee has thus far not made any findings publicly available. We are concerned that the committee’s recommendations may come too late or fail to embody the leadership that Stanford must play in the energy transition. Our alignment on these recommendations demonstrates that stakeholders with different backgrounds and interests can find common ground rooted in our values of integrity and transparency. This work represents a model that we believe could achieve widespread support for reasonable, actionable and verifiable criteria for supporting research at Stanford. We have shared the below recommendations with the CFERE and hope they will incorporate them into their own findings. There is no cause for further delay. Recommendations prepared and approved by: Choi, June Fraces, Cedric Grekin, Rebecca Kashtan, Yannai Long, Wennan Wettermark, Daly Details for Recommendation #2: Dissociate:Eliminate financial sponsorship from any company, trade group, or other organization that engages in any of the following: Details for Recommendation #3: Establish a third-party enforcement board: We define “third party” as a panel of Stanford affiliates, including students, who are not directly responsible for financing of industrial affiliate programs. To address conflicts of interest, any board members must disclose funding from fossil fuel companies. This board shall review existing industry partners based on the above criteria and oversee the dissociation and re-association process. This would involve: Sincerely, June Choiis a Ph.D. candidate in earth system science. Her research focuses on quantifying the impacts of climate change to inform adaptation strategies. Her previous work involved tracking global climate finance flows, setting standards for green bonds and sustainable finance integrity. Cedric Fracesis a Ph.D. student in the energy sciences engineering department. His research focuses on a new class of numerical methods for the simulation and uncertainty characterization of CO2 sequestration in geological formations. Prior to this work, Cedric spent a decade working as a reservoir engineer on major oilfields in the Middle East and Latin America, as well as CO2 sequestration projects in the U.S. and Canada. Rebecca Grekinis a Ph.D. candidate in energy sciences engineering looking at ways to reduce carbon emissions from the commercial building sector from heating and cooling systems by changing the operations of these systems. Prior to this work, she completed a master’s in the same department studying Scope 3 emissions, doing a deep dive into developing automated systems to estimate emissions from food purchasing. Yannai Kashtanis a Ph.D. candidate in earth system science, an organizer for the Coalition for a True School of Sustainability and a Knight-Hennessy Scholar. His doctoral research focuses on the health-related hazards of residential fossil-fueled appliances. Dr. Wennan Longis a recent graduate from the energy science and engineering department at Stanford, where he was advised by professor Adam R. Brandt. He has expertise in energy engineering and life-cycle assessment. His research interest is building simulators to calculate upstream greenhouse gas emissions across the oil and gas supply chain. Dr. Long led the team on theArchie Initiativeto calculate the global oil upstream carbon intensity. Daly Wettermarkis a master’s student in environmental engineering studying operational efficiencies for wastewater treatment and reuse. She is also a climate activist, and she has previously worked as an engineer in product development and corporate sustainability in the water industry.

state_press_2023_5,"There are few resources to help support students through poorly structured weed out classes. These are the classes that make everySTEM studentquestion how many hours they can stare at the same math problem. While weed-out classes across the academic world arefamous for their rigor, denial of their underlying issues can take them from an intellectual challenge to an academic nightmare for students. ASU needs to acknowledge that this isn t okay and that students deserve more support. Cameron McConnell, a senior studying computer science and a tutor at theEngineering Tutoring Center, said that weed-out classes force students to consider if they actually want to stay in their major. They re a big change of pace, because a lot of the previous classes are very practical, Mcconnell said. A lot of students are just thrown off, and they re just like, why am I doing this? For computer science, McConnell identified the three weed-out classes known by many STEM students as “the trifecta. This trend continues in mechanical engineering studies, where the thermodynamics and dynamics classes are common weed-outs. Dynamics was like ... the boss of mechanical engineering, Jayden McGee, a senior studying mechanical engineering, said. An average dynamics homework would take five or six hours. That was gatekeeping me (from the major . McConnell said that the weed-outs were a very hard period of adapting for him, and he sees how much the students who come into the tutoring center struggle as well. Seeing them go through it, it s eye opening, you ll see that, yeah, these students just aren t really well adapted to it, or just are struggling to gain a lot of the concepts, he said. McConnell was surprised by the lack of presence of students in the tutoring center. This small turnout seems counterintuitive because, logically, students should be utilizing resources that are free and accessible to them to pass weed-out classes. It turns out that the effects of the weed-outs ripple to the mindsets of the students. Since weed-outs are so inhospitable for learning, students prioritize passing the class over genuinely retaining the material. Then, those same students are tasked with tutoring others in these subjects. There s no way I m going to ask some poor soul for some help on dynamics, McGee said. You take the class, you wipe it from your memory, unless you re a PhD student. The only way to get help, really, is to go to office hours, where (professors basically just guide you through it anyway. Weed-out classes also require teaching assistant-led recitation sessions for groups of between 20 and 25 students, meant to help students practice the material. Although this aims to help students get individualized help, this isn t actually true, since the professor often isn t even in the room and the TA could be too overwhelmed with questions to help people individually. McConnell also said the manageability of weed-out classes depends on what professor teaches the course. I think that really makes or breaks it, he said. There s some really good professors in the classes that really get you excited about the course, and then there s also some professors that just make it a lot harder than it needs to be. However, students don t always get the option to pick the professors they ll have. For thermodynamics and dynamics in the mechanical engineering track, the professors typically aren’t listed when students are registering for classes. Sometimes you ll see the professor listed on there but a lot of the time, I just have to hope I get a good professor, McGee said. I don t want to spend more energy or time than I have to, (rather than just knowing the professor and knowing that I m going to be supported as a student. Valana Wells, the undergraduate program chair for mechanical and aerospace engineering, did not respond to why the names of professors aren t listed for weed-out classes. Wells actually denied the existence of weed-outs altogether. Mechanical engineering does not have ‘weed out’ classes, Wells said in an email. We realize that engineering is difficult, and we provide multiple resources to help students understand course material so that they can be successful throughout our program. Denying the problem entirely, especially when it is a phenomenon experienced across most STEM programs at ASU, will not help anyone. Weed-out classes in their current nightmarish form wouldn t even exist if the University provided enough support for its struggling students. Making it easier for STEM students to choose professors is the first step towards helping them succeed in these high-level classes. These classes are foundational to students careers, and should center student learning as an exciting goal rather than excusing apathy to students as rigor. Until this is addressed, there will be students who fail these classes or who switch studies entirely, simply because their experience was more of a professor lottery than an academic challenge.

stanforddaily_2023_87,"Warning! Incoming unpopular opinion: Iactuallylike the Ways graduation requirements. The Ways of Thinking, Ways of Doing, or simply Ways requirement, is Stanford’s take on college general education requirements. To graduate, students must take11 coursesin 8 Ways paths; at least two courses must be taken in Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry (AII , Scientific Method and Analysis (SMA , and Social Inquiry (SI , and at least one course in Applied Quantitative Reasoning (AQR , Creative Expression (CE , Exploring Difference and Power (EDP , Ethical Reasoning (ER , and Formal Reasoning (FR . StanfordcharacterizesWays as a “unique general education breadth requirement” and “unlike the disciplinary breadth requirements of many traditional institutions.” The Ways of Thinking and Ways of Doing model teaches students to view various issues in new and broad capacities to enhance their learning experience. The Ways requirement receives a fair amount of criticism, but I think it is, at least, an acceptable requirement to appreciate. As students, we must fulfill the Ways requirements to graduate, so I have compiled a list of positive contributions the Ways requirement has on our college education to reframe how we think of it. For starters, general education requirements are not unique to Stanford. Most universities have general education requirements, so there is really no way around them. However, with Ways, Stanford allows for much room for selection. These requirements can be fulfilled in various ways, with many classes to choose from that focus on different areas. For example, Applied Quantitative Reasoning requires students to use quantitative tools such as data and models to apply methods of reasoning. A student could take BIOE 42: “Physical Biology” for a more direct approach to fulfilling this requirement. However, a student could also take AA 131: “Space Flight,” where rather than doing direct biology, a student can fulfill the AQR learning goals by learning how to build a spacecraft. Or a student could take COLLEGE 105: “The Politics of Development,” where students still learn how to use quantitative tools; however, they are applied with a humanities lens to analyze political foundations. Some classes a student takes for Ways could also fulfill their major requirements. Students can use ExploreCourses to find courses that meet specific Ways requirements and scroll to their respective majors. They can see if classes are listed under their major count for that Ways requirements. A class like BIOE 42 can fulfill the requirement of the AQR Ways while also fulfilling a major requirement for a student majoring in Bioengineering. COMM 104W: “Reporting, Writing, and Understanding the News” fulfills the Creative Expression Ways requirement but can also count towards the Communication major. The flexibility of the Ways requirements can also allow students to learn something new in different ways that may be more comfortable for them. For example, a student can fulfill the Scientific Method and Analysis requirement to understand natural sciences by taking PSYC 135: “Dement’s Sleep and Dreams” to engage in neuroscience rather than something that might be less interesting to them, likeBIO 86: “Cell Biology.” The student can still learn science, but in a way that may be more appealing to the specific student. The Ways requirements also allow students to take classes outside of their major, allowing for a break in their schedule from pure major classes. My Undergraduate Advising Director, Gabriel Wolfenstein (shoutout to Gabriel , recommends spreading Ways classes out so you can have a break from your major throughout many quarters of your Stanford undergraduate career. Many of these Ways classes can be a pop of fun in your schedule like RELIGST 6N: “Religion in Anime and Manga” to learn about the presentation of religions in Japan, AMSTUD 115S: “Spies, Lies, and Algorithms: The History and Future of American Intelligence” to learn about spies and war, and BIO 9N: “Chilis: Biology, History, Travels, Cuisine” to learn about chili peppers. In taking some of these classes outside of their major, students are able to explore different areas that might provoke a new interest or a possible new path. Some classes may urge students to change their field of study to something else they find more appealing or take on a minor to pursue a smaller study. And finally, as cheesy as it may sound, learning about many subjects can make you a well-rounded individual. You could graduate from Stanford as a Classics major, but if you were ever in a heated discussion with colleagues about space exploration, you might have an unusually excellent knowledge of aerodynamic performance because you took AA 100: “Introduction to Aeronautics and Astronautics” to fulfill the SMA or AQR requirement. Or, if you find yourself on a game show post-graduation with a million-dollar question revolving around the history of jazz, you could be a million dollars richer because you took AMSTUD 18A: “Jazz History: Ragtime to Bebop, 1900-1940,” to fulfill the AII requirement. But Ways is not the only graduation requirement. Other controversial requirements include The Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR and the Civic, Liberal, and Global Education (COLLEGE program – Those are a conversation of their own!

state_press_2023_25,"Stantec, a company focused on developing transportation, has released a plan on how automated shuttles could be implemented on ASU s Tempe campus. I m not a huge fan of the transportation, or lack thereof, across ASU s Tempe campus. Tempe is a giant campus, that much is obvious. Especially for me, as a downtown Phoenix student, an approximately 642-acre campus is just insane to imagine. My longest commute on the Downtown Phoenix campus has been a 10-minute walk from Taylor Place, my dorm, to the Mercado complex.On the other hand, my friendBenicio De Puma s shortestcommute last semester on the Tempe campus was a 15-minute dash from one end of campus to another in order to get from his dorm room to class. And this commute had to happen rain or shine — or, to be more specific — in 100-degree weather, torrential downpour or whatever else Mother Nature decided to throw in his way. So, when I saw that recently Stantec, a design and delivery firm focusing on transportation, buildings and community development, released the results of an automated shuttle feasibility study it conducted, I got excited. In the study, Stantec proposed apotential routefor automated shuttles on the Tempe campus, which would help myriad people. This study was created through and funded by Stantec s Greenlight program, a research and development fund that, according to its website, helps to support innovative ideas from employees in order to benefit their clients. We want to demonstrate that AV technology may provide a viable first-mile/last-mile shared micromobility solution that enhances established fixed-route transit. The potential service could also serve as a campus circulator, Frank Domingo, the senior project manager for Stantec Transportation, said in an email statement to The State Press. According to Stantec s website, One of (Stantec s partners in this endeavor is Arizona State University (ASU , a founding partner of the Institute for Automated Mobility. An automated shuttle system is envisioned to provide an alternate mobility option at ASU s Tempe campus, strengthen their commitment to innovation, and further their pursuit of integrating automated vehicles, the website reads. The study outlines a potential route that an automated shuttle would take, which starts at Gammage Auditorium and finishes right around the light rail station at University Drive and Rural Road. Regarding function, the operations (for previous AV shuttles have been starting in dedicated paths that would transition to mixed traffic over time. Hours usually start as limited to daylight operations then transition to longer service hours, Domingo said. Now, unfortunately, no concrete details beyond a potential route and potential schedule have been released as to what this shuttle could look like in practical terms. However, based on otherStantec projectsthat are further underway, there are demonstrations of what this shuttle could look like. Regardless of the lack of concrete details, I think this is a step in the right direction. A shuttle would help people like me who use the light rail in their commute fairly regularly. The walk from the station at Rural Road all the way to somewhere like Coor Hall can be a long one, so having a shuttle in place that could potentially run more regularly than the ASU shuttles Gold Route would definitely be a bonus. It would most definitely be helpful to people like De Puma, a freshman studying secondary education, who, instead of having to run from one end of campus to the other in the heat or rain, could instead take a shuttle that would conveniently drop him off where he needs to be. I m at the San Pablo Residence Hall, it s on the northernmost edge of campus and I had to go to the southwesternmost point of campus, DePuma said. For about the first month of school, mid-August to mid-September, it was pretty consistently 100 or above. However, the group of people this would be most helpful to would be those who have disabilities that affect their mobility. Fortunately, the University does already have theDART programin place to help students with situations like these. However, unfortunately, the DART program does have fairly limited hours, operating only on weekdays from 7:10 a.m. to 6:45 p.m. on the Tempe campus and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on all other campuses. Furthermore, if a student is consistently late for rides or misses rides for two consecutive days without calling to cancel, the student will lose access to DART. An automated shuttle like the one proposed by Stantec would likely not have these limitations. Compared with the current programs in place, I d say an automated shuttle would be an improvement. Because the current situation around transportation isn t great, Stantec s automated shuttle plan is something the University should pursue vigorously should it want to remain No. 1 in innovation.

rice_thresher_2023_51,"ByThresher Editorial Board3/21/23 9:18pm Student Association president Solomon Ni presented a motion during the March 20 senate to pay voting members of the SA essentially $8 every senate in session, which they are required to attend. Our new cohort of SA representatives near-unanimously shot the motion down. While we applaud Ni’s effort to compensate student leaders and aren’t opposed to paying leaders when possible, we have to acknowledge that current resources are limited and ultimately should be best spent to lower the barriers to access opportunities for low income students. A pay capped at $200 for an entire academic year for all voting members of the SA makes little difference in students’ lives compared to redirecting this fund towards need-based allocation for SA members. Divvying up limited resources equally between students doesn’t result in equal impact. First-generation low-income students are frequently at a disadvantage when it comes to their ability to offer up unpaid labor compared to their peers. Offering stipends for low-income students when possible increases the opportunities for them to be involved on campus, as well as promotes inclusivity and brings more diverse voices to the table in our student organizations. There is also something to say about the nature of the SA being a student-elected, voluntary government body. At a time when the student body is vocally questioning the efficacy of the SA and the downright purpose of its existence, we caution the SA against risking increasing dissent for a slim chance of increasing internal engagement. The point of volunteer positions is to give back to the Rice community for that reason. This holds true for organizations outside of the SA as well. We hope we don’t lose sight of the value of volunteering for our community. As a general rule, organizations should direct their resources to the areas they will do the most good. Just looking at the statistics, the majority of Rice students do not need financial incentive to give back to our community. However, for FGLI students, financial accessibility is a barrier to participating in student leadership positions in the SA and beyond. By concentrating resources, we can remove those barriers and ensure everyone’s voice can be heard on campus. We need to think more critically and realistically about how we compensate student leaders. Working with what we have, we should dedicate resources to making student leadership positions accessible to students who might otherwise be financially unable to devote their time. ​​Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

stanforddaily_2023_91,"Recently, the Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU has gone through another election cycle. The students of Stanford elected a new ASSU President and Vice President and also voted in the Undergraduate Senate elections or in the Graduate Student Council elections. Although there was anallegationthat one of the candidates violated the campaign finance rules, overall the elections went smoothly and over 4000 students voted. As we’re processing the outcomes of these elections and waiting for the new legislature and executives to come in, the “lame duck” legislature has taken it upon itself to review the rules that prescribe how elections are being run. We generally encourage the legislature to revisit its bylaws from time to time and consider how they can be improved to secure the democratic process. As two current or former members of the Constitutional Council, we have some concerns, however, about the speed with which this is happening, and the possible implications of specific implementations in the new bylaws. One example pertains to the certification of elections. Student leaders should be representative of the democratic will of the student body and incumbent leaders should not be able to prevent, delay or remove newly elected leaders. With the thought of January 6th in mind, we have all recently experienced how uncertainty about electoral processes can lead to disarray and outright attempts to subvert the democratic will. Unfortunately, the ASSU has its own history when it comes to certification of elections. We would like to take the reader back to the 2004 ASSU election. That year, the Undergraduate Senaterefused to certifythe results of the ASSU presidential election in which the top candidate won by more than 300 votes. Instead, the Undergraduate Senate delayed the Presidential transition and called for a special election without any grounds in the ASSU Constitution. As can be expected,these actions were not conducive to the legitimacy of the ASSU. This set of actions led to a total of three Constitutional Council cases, which resulted in rulings that made it clear that these actions were unconstitutional. This set of circumstances put the Constitutional Council in the awful position of having to decide who were the ASSU Executives: the students who won the general Presidential Election or the ones who won the special election. The Council ruled in favor of the winners of the special election as the winners had already been serving as ASSU Executives for about eight months. At the same time the Councilruled unanimouslythat the Senate acted unconstitutionally. After this series of rulings, the Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate Student Councilamended the Joint Bylaws of the ASSUto make it clear that the Presidential election cannot be undone by the Undergraduate Senate or the Graduate Student Council alone, and instead both of the ASSU legislative bodies must act in concert to invalidate ASSU elections results on four grounds: voter fraud, voter disenfranchisement, partisan conduct by elections officers or an election conducted not in accordance with the ASSU Constitution. Unfortunately, last-minute bylaw amendments with the intent to clarify the ASSU Presidential transition will undo these reforms by requiring the Presidential transition to only take place after the certification of the election results by the Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate Student Council. These proposals might put unelected students (such as elections commissioners or Constitutional Council members in the position of choosing who are the duly elected leaders. To be sure, this recent flurry of activity in procedural bills is a necessary undertaking that ASSU should commit to. The ASSU legislative bodies should draft new election rules. This proposed activity is very encouraging, because it means that people are thinking about complex election issues and are working to improve ASSU procedures which have not been carefully updated in a number of years. It is also a good idea to make these changes well outside of the election season. Unfortunately, haste is a poor advisor when it comes to crafting legislation. As challenges of election results before the Constitutional Council have shown time and again in the past decades (for example in2004,2005andrecently , elections are a breeding ground for potential unconstitutional behavior or rules and these new election rules are likely to introduce new problems. The proposed changes that we are most concerned about are those regarding the transition timeline (e.g.this proposed bill . These changes seek to sync the transition of the ASSU Executive with the legislative bodies — a goal that is perfectly fine in and of itself. However, the proposed language will reintroduce the ability for one legislative body to indefinitely delay the ASSU Executive transition. Furthermore, we encourage the newly elected student leaders in the Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate Student Council to pick up the mantle from the previous legislative bodies and work to finalize the other proposed procedural bills. While it may be tempting to rush through these changes (who wants to discuss boring election legislation for many weeks? , the required 2/3 majority should be an indicator that these changes shouldn’t be rushed. It is important to create a system that is safe and addresses possible irregularities in the process. The legislative bodies have introduced abillamending election sanctions. We think it is valuable to revisit this framework cautiously, especially considering the criticism that was repeatedly expressed regarding the constitutionality of various campaigning constraints. Our concern about the implementation in this bill is that it seems likely that it will lead to more invalidated elections. The bill introduces the option that candidates are disqualified before the election, yet it is possible the Constitutional Council rules a slate or candidate disqualification was invalid after the election has already taken place. In this situation the Constitutional Council would have to decide if the wrongful removal of a candidate from the ballot necessitates the invalidation of that election. A candidate wrongly removed from the ballot does not have a fair chance of winning the election they are running in. We urge prudence and hope the ASSU legislature works to address these issues prior to adopting bylaw amendments. The bylaws need revision and we embrace the ASSU taking on the difficult task of election policy reform. There are probably a number of other issues that can be improved in the election legislation (see, for example,this recent op-edby one of the authors and it may be advisable to ask a joint committee to evaluate the entire package of regulations in light of the ASSU Constitution, Constitutional Council rulings and general best practices in dialogue with the student community — not only to optimize election security, but also to make it a pleasant process for candidates and voters alike, hopefully with higher turnout and more candidates as a result. We urge the current members of the ASSU legislature to postpone adoption of these bylaw amendments and instead allow the newly elected members to resolve the issues we raise here.

stanforddaily_2023_29,"I’ve read a lot of op-eds lately on Stanford’s now-infamous Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative (EHLI . Most of them converge along the same line, denouncing the list as “stupid,” “Orwellian” or “ultra-woke.”USA Today, theWall Street Journaland theStanford Reviewall adopted a sharply facetious tone towards the initiative (and fair enough . But in this article, I want to focus on something that most commentaries and discussions on the topic overlook: that is, whatpreciselywas wrong with the now-withdrawn list? A recent opinionsarticlein The Daily, which took a sympathetic stance towards the EHLI, regards the flaw of the list as simply being “too careful” by including certain words that were “unnecessary.” The article asserts that the opponents of the list fail to look past the politically-correct flavor and recognize the positive impacts the EHLI would have had: namely, empowerment, improvement of self-image and promotion of inclusiveness of campus. I do believe initiatives like the EHLI couldhave positive impacts if created in the right way with the right rationale. But I don’t believe the EHLI, in particular,would have had positive impacts. A perfectly valid rationale for creating such a list would be to inform readers who come from various backgrounds, cultures or countries what words may cause offense to members of protected identity groups. This could help prevent individuals from inadvertently generating harm or conflict. Although Stanford’s list included a few offensive terms (i.e., slurs targeted at protected identity groups with this rationale, the EHLI’s motive is essentially different. The EHLI’s preamblestatesthe following: The goal of the Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative is to eliminate many forms of harmful language, including racist, violent, and biased (e.g., disability bias, ethnic bias, ethnic slurs, gender bias, implicit bias, sexual bias language in Stanford websites and code. In plain terms, the goal of the EHLI is to eliminate ‘bad’ or ‘undesirable’ uses of language (so-called “harmful language” . Even if a term does not cause any offense to anyone, as long as it is theoretically ‘undesirable’ in any way, it should thus be eliminated. This is vastly different from simplyinformingreaders what words may possibly cause offense. Consider the terms “blacklist,” “abort,” “mankind” or “people of color.” The EHLI proposes that we eliminate their use not because they may cause offense, but because they may have theoretical negative effects or are theoretically ‘suboptimal.’ For example, the EHLI suggests eliminating the use of “blacklist” because it “assigns negative connotations to the color black, racializing the term.” So what is wrong with such a rationale? As the author of the other Daily article observes, “Why must there be limits on our wish to be inclusive?” No, there need not be a limit on our wish to be inclusive. But we do not promote inclusion simply by wishing for it. Not only have I not seen any evidence that eliminating the use of theoretically bad words promotes inclusion or “protects another person’s sense of self,” recent psychological literature indicates that such initiatives could actually produce harmful effects. “Concept creep,” firstidentifiedby University of Melbourne psychology professor Nick Haslam in 2016, describes the phenomenon where a concept expands its semantic scope. Haslam notes that harm-related concepts such as abuse, trauma, mental disorder and prejudice have all undergone concept creep in recent decades. For example, the concept of racism has expanded from overt prejudice and discrimination to merely “denying the continuing existence of racism and expressing opposition to affirmative action policies,” or, as Haslam puts it, from “expressed antipathy” to “inferred antipathy.” Concept creep isn’t a problem as such; in fact, it demonstrates a form of moral progress. It shows that our society is becoming safer and more inclusive, as milder and milder forms of harm are becoming unacceptable. But too much concept creep produces negative effects. A 2022 studyfoundthat having a broader conception of trauma may cause one to experience more negative emotions and subsequent post-traumatic symptoms after experiencing a stressful event. A 2019 study alsofoundthat training that seeks to broaden the concepts of harm and offense led people to perceive more harm and offense in ambiguous situations. The EHLI suffers from an excess of concept creep, as it extends the concepts of harm, trauma, racism, sexism and violence to encompass completely innocuoususes of language. By designating theoretically bad words as “harmful,” the initiative attaches actual harm to hitherto harmless words — an act of self-fulfilling prophecy. A 2023 studynotesthat “well-intentioned efforts to boost awareness of the potential harm conveyed in others’ words may have the inadvertent effect of exacerbating perceptions of harm and hurtful intent in others.” Ironically, the EHLI’s attempt to reduce harm may produce more harm for the groups of people it seeks to protect. Nevertheless, I don’t wish to throw the baby out with the bathwater (to use a “harmful” term . As I mentioned above, I see genuine value in creating a list with the rationale to inform people who come from vastly different backgrounds and cultures of terms that others may find offensive or harmful. But a properly-formulated list should bedescriptiveand notprescriptive. It should simply convey what members of protected identity groups find harmful, as opposed to proposing what should theoretically be considered harmful. This means that the inclusion of words on such a list should solely be evidence-based (e.g., consulting and surveying of members of protected identity groups , not theory-based. I believe a list of this sort couldactuallypromote inclusion on our diverse campus. YuQing Jiang ’25 is a columnist for the Opinions section for Vol. 262.

crimson_2023_25,"Eight United States presidents, 22 Supreme Court justices, and 29 Massachusetts governors have one thing in common: the transformative experience of a Harvard education. It is no secret that Harvard is a breeding ground for our nation’s, and the world s, budding political superstars. Our university is routinely one of the top-ranked schools for political science and its neighboring disciplines, and we maintain close ties with power players like the Kennedy and Obama families. But while Harvard’s proximity to power might benefit the political aspirations of our affiliates, we ought to worry about its negative effects on democratic representation. Inan interview with The Crimsonafter University President Claudine Gay’s recent inauguration, Massachusetts Governor Maura T. Healey ’92 praised Harvard’s intellectual and social diversity when she was a student as useful preparation for leadership. However, despite diversity in some aspects, a look at the makeup of our student body reveals a more homogenous reality.Based on current research, 67 percent of enrolled students come from the top 20 percent of the income distribution nationwide and around 30 percent of admits are athletes, legacies, and children of faculty or donors. Such statistics illustrate a glaring and uncomfortable truth about our institution: It provides an education by the elite and for the elite. Even if an admitted student is not a part of the socioeconomic upper class upon enrolling, they are likely to join it when they leave. For example, in The Crimson’s senior survey of theCollege Class of 2023, over 50 percent of respondents on full financial aid reported that they would make more than $90,000 annually in their first post-graduation job, or more than $30,000 above the national average for recent college graduates. No matter one’s background entering Harvard, we all tend to leave as elites. Given the high concentration of socioeconomic power held by Harvard alumni, one must begin to question whether or not our political overrepresentation is just, and whether our University’s affiliates in government are truly representative of the majority of the United States’ constituency. At present, Harvard is at a crossroads regarding its role in fostering equity in our society, especially given its position as one of the world’s top ranked and richest universities. Between ongoing admissions debates and the commencement of Claudine Gay’s administration at the moment of affirmative action’s demise, Harvard has spent the past year publicly battling a tension between a facade of equity and diversity and an adherence to a status quo that favors the wealthy and otherwise hyper-privileged. Harvard’s allegiance to the powerful is exemplified by its persistent defense of donor and legacy preferences in admissions, as well as its gaudy rewards for individuals who donate to the University, no matter the nature oftheir individual impact. Significant questioning of Harvard’s excessive influence in national, state, and municipal government probably won’t be led by its administration. Instead, it must begin with our choices as students and alumni. To engender a political electorate truly representative of the vast class and educational backgrounds of the United States, we must shift away from the traditional structures of power that typically benefit us as Harvard students. It is time for Harvard affiliates to take the backseat in our pursuit of political leadership. That’s right: Harvard students should seek public office less often. Instead, students and alumni should dedicate more time to uplifting candidates and representatives who don’t have the privilege we share. To be clear, I am not arguing that Harvard alumni have no place at all in government. Rather, Harvard students should use their positionality to advocate for the advancement of leaders from underrepresented class and educational backgrounds in American political leadership — candidates without bachelor’s degrees, candidates with a community college education, and candidates with working class jobs. In other words, Harvard and its affiliates do not need to be front and center in political movements all the time. As Harvard students, we enjoy a crimson-tinted gravitas that we can use to draw attention to a myriad of issues that do not require holding elected office to influence. In fact, many Harvard students enter this institution already having created immense political change within their communities without being elected to public office. Harvard students can and should still strive to continue the legacy of changemakers that came before us. But we do not need to be United States President, Speaker of the House, or Senate Majority Leader in order to do so. Jasmine N. Wynn ’27 , a Crimson Editorial comper, lives in Thayer Hall."
crimson_2023_161,"Growing up Mormon in my conservative Phoenix suburb, the subject of queerness was so thoroughly taboo to me that my conceptualization of what “gay” meant and looked like was nearly exclusively defined by the two queer-coded characters I saw on television: Ryan from High School Musical and Kurt from Glee. Given that those two performances were, more or less, my only data points on what gay men were like, I accepted without question most — if not all — of the stereotypes that I heard in the hallways of my elementary and junior high school. Among other things, gay men enjoyed musical theater, listened to Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, gesticulated with their hands, and didn’t care for sports. Well, I fit into every last one of those descriptions, and — owing to the fact that I grew up in a brazenly homophobic area where anyone who could conceivably masquerade as straight did so — every openly gay person I knew seemed to as well. So even though I was closeted and somewhat in denial about my sexuality throughout high school and, later, on a two-year church mission, I still felt comfortable assuming that virtually all gay men were exactly like me. Coming to Harvard, however, threw me for a loop. Here, gay men weren’t justtoken gossip buddies, effusive student body presidents, and liberal activists. They were also car enthusiasts, powerlifters, and everything else I had once assumed exclusively straight. While I appreciated this new environment and the safety it offered me as I began to unlearn the more regressive doctrines of my religious upbringing and accept myself as gay, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of unease. As someone who had grown up rehearsing introductions in futile attempts to ‘straighten’ my voice and mannerisms, I felt particularly threatened by the throngs of more masculine-presenting gay and bisexual men on campus. How could we be equally queer? From my perspective, they seemed to benefit from all the privileges of straightness with little of the ridicule, exclusion, and self-loathing that had been routine in my life for so many years. If my friends and classmates who seemed to exist comfortably within the heteronormative constructs of the gender roles assigned to them were queer, what did being queer even mean? How could it be possible that around27 percent of my Class of 2025 peers identified as LGBTQ+in sexual orientation, when I had always felt so alone at my approximately 3,500-student public high school? How could my friends ‘explore’ their queerness when I had spent the better half of my life running away from mine? The white girl who kissed another woman at a party once and was now bi, the masculine prep school guy who used he/they pronouns — did they just want to be special? To have their chance to scale the “oppression olympics” podium? On campus, the same words I had intentionally avoided my entire life to deflect suspicion of my sexuality were everywhere. Even straight people were using “slay,” “camp,” and all the latest terminology from RuPaul’s Drag Race. In short, I felt as though my identity — which I was finally starting to feel comfortable expressing — was under attack. Being queer was suddenly socially acceptable, and it appeared to me that everyone was trying to get in on the fun. With time, however, my self-obsessed indignation slowly began to subside. As I became more comfortable with who I was, flamboyance and all, my sexuality ceased to be an outsized insecurity of mine. I no longer needed to be the person I had once been: a scared, closeted teen desperate for confidantes whose journeys exactly mirrored my own. In listening to the stories of friends across all shades of the LGBTQ+ spectrum, I began to internalize that others’ unique identities didn’t invalidate mine. Gay, bi, lesbian, trans, intersex, and gender-nonconforming people could all fall under the same “queer” umbrella without being equally subject to the same histories or difficulties, both across and within distinct camps of gender identity and sexual orientation. Moreover, in researching queer history, I realized how indebted gay culture is toAfrican American Vernacular Englishandactivists of color— making my attempts to lay claim to ‘queer lingo’ feel farcical in retrospect. Gradually, I came to the conclusion that I didn’t need to be uncommon or subversive or marginalized to be ‘special.’ There was nothing aboutqueer joyI felt the need to gatekeep; I was no arbiter of another person’s gender or sexual identity. In my mind, queer liberation is about securing all people the safety to be the “truest, most beautiful” versions of themselves. We all deserve the freedom to venture beyond the confines of the boxes in which we have been placed and select for ourselves the lifestyles, pronouns, and partners that are most congruous. So, screw 27 percent. I hope everyone at Harvard feels free to be queer. Grant B. Williams ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Statistics concentrator in Cabot House."
stanforddaily_2023_52,"I have three midterms this week. I slept two hours last night. Coffee doesn’t do anything for me anymore.We’ve all heard these phrases repeated ad nauseam by Stanford students — ourselves included. None of us are strangers to packed days and sleepless nights. The 10-week sprint every quarter forces us to constantly reevaluate social, academic and personal priorities to maximize utility: Do I go to bed early, or hop on my computer and apply to another internship? Or, screw it! Should I go out with my friends to KSig? The productivist ethos — the notion that “staying busy” is a virtue — permeates Stanford’s culture and is often equated with success. We constantly strive to make the most of every minute of our college experience, shunning all things we deem “unproductive.”Carpe diem,or “seize the moment,” quickly spirals into “seize every second.” This ceaseless pursuit of productivity, however, makes us so consumed in our own routines and aspirations that we cease to recognize the vagaries of life around us. More importantly, we can cease to appreciate the people who facilitate our education. When we look around campus, there are many examples of students leaving a mess in public spaces, reflecting an expectation that someone else will take care of their problems. During the move-in and move-out periods at either end of the year, the hallways are flooded with cardboard boxes and other debris from packing, even though signs clearly show where to dispose of trash and recyclables. Students frequently leave dorm room garbage and dirty dishes outside their doors, waiting for somebody else — custodial staff, presumably — to come pick them up. The unsanitary use of dorm showers and toilets makes one wonder whether we live with adults or toddlers. Stories abound about chefs and cleaners quitting Row houses due to lack of appreciation and disrespect of communal spaces by students (including rumors that people would urinate on the floor of the kitchen during parties at one fraternity . The individualism of productivist culture, combined with the self-absorption required to achieve career and academic success, too often manifests in self-centered behavior. Rather than taking 20 extra seconds to hold the door for a stranger, we focus on opening doors for ourselves. In aiming to improve our own condition, we have abandoned the centralStanford callof improving the condition of others. At a university with a student body so ostensiblyconcernedwith public good and moral righteousness, we must ask ourselves whether we champion the true meaning of these terms as they exist before us. Thanking the person who washes our plates, saying hello to the person keeping our hallways clean — these interactions of essential meaning can feel awkward and trite in the dog-eat-dog, fast-moving stochasticism that can beStanford. These considerations of our collective student behavior are distinct from the University’s relationship with workers; these are important issues that should be separately addressed. It falls on the student body to be upstanding in showing the emotional appreciation, human respect and dignity that service workers at Stanford havehistoricallyfailed to receive. Rather than focusing on the chaos of Wilbur’s long dinner lines or missing silverware, we ought to rally around what wedohave and what wecanbe thankful for. Certainly, student frustrations about the gap between the steep price tag of our living arrangements and its sometimessubpar realitiesare understandable. At the same time, they should not be taken out on the chefs, dish washers, cleaners, drivers, librarians and other dedicated individuals who provide some of our university’s most essential functions. Our attitude toward services at Stanford, from employees at Tresidder to transportation, needs to respect and acknowledge thehuman beingbehind each and every one of these services on this campus. In doing so, we move beyond the often cyclical, withdrawn exercise of calling out privilege among our peers and identify and address our own “look away” privilege ofpassivity. As many of us spend the break away from campus, it is worth reflecting on and acknowledging the work of ourentirecommunity: How much is done for us students to have comfortable and convenient lives here, and how lucky we are to be able to focus on our own success and academic achievement. In reality, some of the most positive impact that we are able to create in the world during our time here is in making other people’s lives better. That starts with gratitude.

crimson_2023_72,"I was a first-year when I fell in love with philosophy. To say I fell feels misleading. The process was more akin to a rediscovery. Philosophy allowed me to put a name to and study the questions that I had long toyed with, and to revisit authors whose works had enticed me in high school. This would not have happened without my enrollment in Humanities 10. Hum10 is a course that offers a broad introduction to the humanities. Reading works across a variety of disciplines — including literature, history, philosophy, the classics, and African American studies — students in the course have the opportunity to get a taste of what a variety of humanities fields have to offer. Reading Plato’s Symposium and Descartes’ Meditations on First Philosophy, and engaging in a Hum10 seminar with philosophy professor Alison J. Simmons allowed me to explore a field of study which I had not previously considered as a real possibility. Hum10 is one of few courses that bring together such a wide variety of fields for exploration. While Harvard offers a plethora of introductory courses in various departments, there are very few courses that provide a similarly broad overview of the fields studied across Harvard’s many departments. This can and should change if Harvard wants to foster intellectual growth and exploration — the pinnacle of a liberal arts education — among its students. While some students accepted to Harvard already know their academic passion, this is not the case for all. Many, including me, have found new interests while at Harvard. This is good. If every Harvard student began and ended their time here with the same interests, it would be anything but “transformative,” the oft-repeated mission of the College according to our dean. Harvard’s academic departments should collaborate to find ways to offer similar introductory courses across their faculty. If we have Hum10, why not offer a similar course in the natural sciences, bringing together faculty on the cutting edge of biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics to show students where a degree in these disciplines could lead them? Courses of this kind would be very different from courses like Life Sciences 1a, designed to provide life sciences concentrators with basic skills to continue their academic work. I propose courses that do not aim to provide a thorough introduction to a single discipline, but rather motivate intellectual curiosity and provide a chance for students to see the many paths that exist within the liberal arts and sciences. While it may appear as though General Education courses fill this role, these courses — as outlined by the college — offer a distinct focus on real-world applicability. Although students who graduate Harvard need to be ready for the world, there is a separate and important need for them to understand their academic interests. The approach of GenEd courses — to bring together students across departments — provides an example of this philosophy in action, but students still must understand what the many academic disciplines offer before they choose to concentrate in one. How can students know if sociology is their calling if they have never even spoken to a sociologist? How can students know if research in biology is their passion if they would never consider taking a biology course to begin with? Exposure to multiple fields in an interdisciplinary setting provides students a chance to explore and discover passions without requiring them to dive head first into a course whose topic may be a mere passing interest. If Harvard wants to remain true to its stated purpose as a liberal arts institution, then it must make the liberal arts and sciences more open to exploration for those without prior experience or interest. Without the opportunity afforded to me by Hum10 — a chance to explore many fields — I would not have considered the Philosophy concentration which has grown near and dear to my heart. Harvard should work to help more students discover their passions with greater ease through broader survey courses so that we can experience the fulfillment of a liberal arts education, not only in the future, but also now.

crimson_2023_136,"On the wall in my childhood home hangs my great-grandmother’s family tree. It’s in a gilded frame, but in a back room, both revered and ignored. I remember looking up at it as a child, intrigued by the legend at the bottom: Yellow star indicated “Commissioned Military Officer,” blue star meant “Patriot of the Revolution,” and squiggly underline signified a “Founder of Family in America.” These were things I was taught to be proud of. Years later, while an undergraduate, I joined a fossil fuel divestment campaign. It was students of color who began to teach me the deeper roots of the climate crisis. Hearing about colonialism and racial capitalism for the first time, I couldn’t help but draw links between those topics and my own family. Some of my ancestors were founders of American families; others were bankers, lawyers, or captains of ships and industry. Both of my grandfathers worked on Wall Street. Soon it became clear to me: I have personal divestment work to do. I joinedResource Generation, a national network of young people with wealth and class privilege who organize in partnership with poor and working class-led movements to redistribute money, land, and power. In RG, we have a practice of telling “money stories”: the too often unspoken narratives behind the racial wealth gap in this country. I learned to see how my family’s good fortune had been bolstered by generations of Ivy League degrees and country club connections — the boarding school to boardroom pipeline. As I revisited that family tree with RG, it wasn’t long before I uncovered dozens of stories of my ancestors’ participation in the founding injustices of this country: colonization and slavery. One of those ancestors has a house at Harvard named after him. In the top left corner of my family tree appears Governor John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, my tenth-great-grand-uncle. Winthrop believed the aristocracy should justly rule, that religious dissenters should be banished, and that God had chosen some to be rich and all others to be poor. He also took the Massachusett tribe’s territory for his own, personally enslaved Native people, and helped write the first law legalizing slavery in North America. Winthrop is said to have declared one of the first “thanksgivings” in 1637, as a celebratory feast after the Mystic Massacre: An estimated 700 Pequot men, women, and children were burned alive, with any who tried to escape the flames shot on sight. In 1638, while the colony was under his leadership, a ship named Desire brought enslaved Africans to Boston for the first time. This is not an ancestor to be proud of. Yet Harvard has made Winthrop unavoidable. From Winthrop House to the larger-than-life statue in Annenberg Hall, his legacy and likeness are memorialized, valorized, and uplifted. I encounter him almost daily, as do thousands of other Harvard students, many of whose ancestors were directly victimized by mine. In February, the Generational African American Students Association, in collaboration with Natives at Harvard College, submitted arequest to dename Winthrop House, accompanied by a petition which has so far accrued over 600 signatories. The request echoes much of the history the University has already admitted to, with the Winthrop name appearing 109 times inHarvard’s Legacy of Slavery report. “The damage caused by Harvard’s entanglements with slavery and its legacies warrant action,” says the report. “Such action cannot possibly address the many complex and damaging legacies of slavery in and beyond the United States, but nonetheless, action is vital.” As part of this public commitment to action, the denaming of certain buildings, professorships, and programs is a step Harvard can and must take. This is not about erasing history, but putting it in its rightful place — in history books, curricula, and museums — instead of it being a haunting presence in the daily lives of students. Some of my family members accuse me of judging our ancestors by the standards of our own time. In response, I point to the small but important history of anti-racist choices by white people as evidence that a different decision could always have been made. In Winthrop’s time, it was Roger Williams, who wrote to him asking him to reconsider “perpetuall slaverie” of captives from the Pequot War. Other family members have worried I am trying to break ties with our ancestors. To the contrary, I see this work of truth-telling as bringing me closer to them: Before I began talking about this history, the Winthrop name had been long forgotten in my family. Indeed, asI preached about at Harvard Divinity School last year, Winthrop’s story now motivates the racial justice work that I see as mine to do. By committing to transform and transmute the trauma he caused, I’m trying to prevent wealth inequality and racial violence from becoming the final chapter of our family’s legacy. And I’m not the only one: So far, I and 44 of my fellowWinthrop descendants have signed onin support of GAASA and NAHC’s request. “Our history demands aconscious, collective, emotional ‘knowing’about the legacy of slavery,” say psychologists Bryan K. Nichols and Medria L. Connolly. “Otherwise, the moral wound of slavery will continue to persist.” Harvard has allowed the moral wound of slavery to persist for far too long. Amidst nationwide efforts to obscure our country’s past, this University has a timely opportunity to step toward the right side of history. We must begin by listening to Black and Indigenous communities whose “knowing” about the impacts of our history has been for far too long ignored. One step is clear: Winthrop must fall. Morgan H. Curtis is a second-year Master of Theological Studies student at Harvard Divinity School."
ubyssey_2023_36,"March 7, 2023 Written byAnonymous This article contains discussions of suicide and transphobia. I am tired. I am tired of waking up every day wondering if today someone close to me, in my community, will be killed, wondering if I will be killed for existing and trying to live in peace in the world and within ourselves. Other Trans students probably feel the same way. When I moved to Vancouver in 2022 to pursue my PhD, I was promised an inviting place, full of liberals and fellow ‘woke’ folks, as Vancouverites are often described. When I arrived, the city and the people in it were anything but. OnFebruary 13, I attended AMS Council, and during a five-hour discussion, I witnessed many of my fellow Transgender and gender-diverse folks stand up for our right to health care and for our right to exist as students on UBC campus. However, at the same time, I noticed councillors not paying attention. I witnessed councillors staring down at their phones, texting and scrolling social media. I saw them exchange glances and judgements as we spoke. As my friends and I broke down standing at the back of the room, councillors were smirking. I thought to myself,what is bringing them joy in this moment?Is it our fear? Our ability to risk our lives by speaking up and exposing ourselves to the Council? Or is ittheirfear? Maybe it’s their fear of being exposed for supporting Trans lives. Their fear of making the wrong decision for cisgender students — seeing as roughly two per cent of undergraduate students identify as Trans, non-binary, Two Spirit and/or gender-diverse, according to the2019 AMS Academic Experience Survey, as one of the councillors indicated in their statement. We begged for our rights and at the end of it all, we remained unheard. We stood there and listened to our concerns belittled by a majority vote that summarized Trans health care and our lives in a short sentence: “Do you support an increase of $8.00 to expand your student insurance fees to include gender-affirming care?” One AMS exec looked us in the eyes and assured us Council would campaign to get this referendum passed stating, “the only thing AMS executives and councillors are good at and competent at is running in elections and getting students out to vote. This campaign is a campaign for our lives. My life is being put up for a vote. Transphobic comments impact me, whether that s at UBC or beyond. Comments like these forced myself to lose who I am after being manipulated for months to think I was lesser than cis people. I heard several remarks that by being Trans I would ruin someone’s life. That it must be so hard to exist as Trans due to the world’s hatred of us. And in November 2022, I tried to take my own life. As I am writing this, it is clear that my attempt was unsuccessful — however, that in itself is a success. I am so grateful to still be here. This is the current reality of many Transgender and gender-diverse students at UBC and beyond. My story does not mention the physical violence that I have endured on campus, or the stories of violence, transphobic comments or hatred experienced by my community at UBC. AMS Council’s refusal to listen to our experiences is dangerous for gender-diverse students. By putting gender-affirming care up to a vote, the AMS is increasing the visibility of Trans and gender-diverse individuals. Standing there, hearing cis folks tell us that what they are doing is in the best interest of the students to maintain transparency,whilestudents were standing there telling them this is not a good idea was simply egregious. This visibility can increase harm done toward Trans students, leaving us without healthcare and unsafe. This seperate referendum item encourages the idea that Trans people are different from our cis peers. While this motion passed, all I could think about was whether I would be safe to enter my classes in the upcoming weeks. Whether they believe that $8 is worth more to them than our lives. My Trans friends and I disclosed personal aspects of our lives that we should never have had to publicly disclose. That night, I had the same thoughts as I did back in November — standing there for hours hearing that we were wrong made me feel inferior, made me feel as if my voice did not matter and that my life does not matter. I felt and feel helpless. Councillors did not care about Trans students during the Council meetings and this can impact how they campaign. But, through the hopefully successful referendum, I hope that they prove me wrong by ensuring our safety while campaigning. And to those councillors who supported us, thank you. We see you, and we appreciate you. UBC is a beautiful campus with many beautiful qualities, and I am very fortunate and privileged to be a student at UBC, as we all are, but this referendum question gives us an opportunity to shape this campus into an equitable and inclusive space. So vote. Vote so that we may start to see a day where Transgender lives are not up for debate. My life should not be up for debate — lives should not be up for debate.

wildcat_arizona_2023_10,"Screenshot of Electric Callboy’s page on YouTube. My life changed the moment I saw a bunch of German men in matching outfits singing and bobbing their heads in a music video. I was introduced to Electric Callboy a couple years ago. A song called “We Got the Moves” was shown to me with a really weird music video. All the members of the band were wearing coordinating white shirts, pale yellow pants, rectangular glasses and ugly bowl cut wigs. All of them stood around, bobbing their heads like chickens, and next thing you know outsiders slowly walked by and reciprocated this bobbing head motion. It was a strange phenomenon, but I was mesmerized by these guys playing a heavy rock song in a backyard barbecue setting. Hailing from Castrop-Rauxel, Germany, Electric Callboy is described as electro-metal, a mixture of electronic music and metal music, and formed in 2010. Formerly Eskimo Callboy, the band has grown a lot since their first name. Fans have addressed offensive content in old lyrics and their name, which led to the changing of their band name and their response to the comments. The band is mostly known for their comedic songs, sexualized lyrics and music videos; but to me, they’re much more than that. My obsession quickly went from casually listening to “We Got the Moves” to buying a physical copy of their newest album,Tekkno, and buying tickets twice for their U.S. tour. Anytime I needed something to brighten my mood, I would guide myself to their music because their songs have such a pick-me-up feel to them. The comedy and sexual connotations in their music were apparent and catchy, but I never thought I would come across truly emotional songs. When I did, I was all that more in love with Electric Callboy. “Prism” and “Mindreader” are two songs that have stuck out to me and brought out feelings I didn’t know this band was capable of pulling from me. My interpretation of “Prism,” is that the subject has been knocked down and doesn’t know how to get back up. The lyrics of the song are someone talking to and reassuring the subject, empowering them once again. The song begins with, “You are so special but so insecure with all the struggles you had to endure, you are a light caught in a prism.” Those three lines encapsulate the modern day young person, like myself, to a tee and knowing that I feel seen in this sense is an amazing feeling. “Mindreader” is off ofTekknoand my personal favorite on the album. The idea is of that special someone that is knowingly toxic to you but you can’t get them off your mind. Granted, the general topic is a basic and used one, but the way the lyrics portray it is truly a piece of art in my opinion. Not only is the song a work of art, but the music video is as well — literally. The video features singers Kevin Ratajczak and Nico Sallach and the imagery of the song comes from women with body paint and clothing to make them appear ghoulish and haunting. Throughout the video, they stand behind the singers, running their claws over their bodies in a powering way. While this is much different from Electric Callboy’s usual music videos, I feel it’s a very beautiful statement and visually shows the band’s diversity. This is my official message to not judge a book by its cover, because I never would have thought a meme band would be my top three songs in my Spotify Wrapped at the end of last year. Foreign bands or artists aren’t as intimidating as they seem and you may be able to find your new favorite musicians among artists outside the U.S. FollowAmanda Mourelatos onTwitter"

crimson_2023_64,"This op-ed is part of a special opinion package, “Antisemitism at Harvard, According to Seven Jewish Affiliates.”View the full package here. Since Oct. 7, Harvard hasbeen buffetedby controversyover the relationship between antisemitism, criticism of Israel, and the assertion of Palestinian rights. There are two intertwined but separate components to the controversy: When criticism of Israel becomes antisemitic, and if and how a university should restrict speech on its campus. A better understanding of what is — and is not — antisemitic will improve how we discuss both. Over the last twenty years, three Jewish groups have produced definitions of antisemitism that have competed for global attention. The best-known of these was adopted in 2016 by theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. In 2021, there appeared two more definitions, contained inthe Nexus Documentand theJerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. As an expert on Jewish and Israeli history, I serve on the Nexus Task Force, which created the Nexus Document before I joined, and was a signatory to the JDA. The three documents have a lot in common. They generally share the view that antisemitism is, in the words of the JDA, “discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish .” They agree that attributing malevolent qualities to Jews as a group, depicting Jews as disloyal or treacherous, and caricatures of Jews as grotesque are all antisemitic. The documents differ sharply, however, when it comes to the relationship between antisemitism and critique of Israel. Following the IHRA definition, calling Israel racist or subjecting it to criticism not directed toward any other democratic country is antisemitic. The JDA and ND definitions, however, leave more room for criticism of Israel, and in that sense they are more conducive to the essential, though difficult, conversations happening within the Harvard community. “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice,” proposing different political arrangements for Jews and Arabs within historic Palestine, and “evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state” are not usually antisemitic following the JDA definition. The ND points out several reasons besides antisemitism why Israel’s actions receive more global attention than those of other nations mired in conflict. Both the JDA and ND agree that, in the words of the ND, “even contentious, strident, or harsh criticism of Israel for its policies and actions, including those that led to the creation of Israel, is not per se illegitimate or antisemitic.” Mainstream Jewish organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, the Jewish Federations of North America, and the World Jewish Congress have championed the IHRA definition. Some pro-Israel organizations like StandWithUs that support the IHRA definition deride the JDA and ND for taking a permissive stance toward what they regard as dangerous forms of hatred against Jews. Nonetheless, like the IHRA definition, the JDA and ND present certain criticisms of Israel as clearly antisemitic. Placing Israel at the heart of conspiracy theories, presenting Israel as solely responsible for global crises, attributing Israel’s actions to Jews worldwide, and any form of harm, intimidation, or abuse of a Jew because of an alleged or real connection to Israel constitute antisemitism under these definitions. The JDA and ND both affirm that denying Jews the rights to self-determination, safety, security, and equality in the state of Israel is antisemitic. In the spirit of these documents, whether historic Palestine becomes home to separate Jewish and Arab states, or a single state in which Jews and Palestinians share power, or a confederation with Jewish and Palestinian components, Jews have every right to a homeland. These definitions are guidelines, not binding codes of conduct, but Harvard should be mindful of them as it strives to balance the right to self-expression with respect for others in its community. The intimate environment of a residential university where students learn and live together is different from the public sphere, where people are much more free to avoid highly emotional political speech if they feel threatened or harassed. On a campus, free speech is a cherished value, but so is fair speech. In considering limits to or consequences of the exercise of speech, the time, place, and manner of a statement about Israel is no less important than whether it is antisemitic. It is understandable that many Jewish students at Harvard are on edge. But the enormous media attention paid to antisemitism at Harvard has obscured the vulnerability of pro-Palestinian students, who have faced harassment by actors outside of the University and verbal abuse on and near campus. According to the JDA, “what is true of racism in general is true of antisemitism in particular.” Where there is antisemitism, other forms of group hatred flourish as well. Conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism magnifies divisions within our Harvard community and stymies a common struggle against hatred. Addressing antisemitism at Harvard will require a holistic approach to fostering substantive, informed, and civil conversation about contentious issues. By defining what antisemitism means on our campus and acting accordingly, we can define in turn what kind of community we want Harvard to be. Derek J. Penslar is the William Lee Frost Professor of Jewish History and the director of the Harvard Center for Jewish Studies.

rice_thresher_2023_4,"ByThresher Editorial Board1/10/23 9:48pm Student Association elections at Rice routinely garner little attention, often struggling to break 25% turnout, which the Thresher and years of SA representatives have called problematic for the health of our student government. With the recently proposed election timeline cutting campaigning to just one week, we’re worried this year we might manage to reach a new low. In previous years, the SA election saw nearly three weeks of campaigning, including the week-long voting period. That might sound like a long time, but many students who didn’t vote in SA elections say they didn’t know the election was happening or couldn’t be bothered to vote. While the official election timeline has not been set, the proposed timeline shared with the Thresher indicated only one week of campaigning, followed by the standard one week of voting. While the director of elections indicated that campaigning may be allowed to continue through the week of voting, we do not feel this is a substitute for ample time before the election. The director declined to share his reasoning for the change with the Thresher. The potential extension to the proposed timeline still cuts the campaign period down by 33%. This reduces time for candidates to reach potential voters and is not sufficient time for candidates to promote their platforms. Why should students be invested in an election when candidates aren’t given the time to be invested in them? As a guiding principle, the SA should be trying to improve engagement in their elections, and the best way is to allow candidates more time to connect with potential voters. Considering our voter turnout was critically low to begin with, we think it unwise to implement election policies that will further discourage candidates’ abilities to engage voters. A week-long campaign timeline will do more harm than good when it comes to increasing voter participation and for allowing voters to gain a comprehensive sense of who and what is on the ballot. Typically SA election timelines are voted on in November, but this year, Senate will be voting on an election timeline on Jan. 23, meaning any changes to the timeline are on a tight deadline as election season approaches. We encourage everyone to reach out to their college’s SA representatives and ask them to support multiple weeks of campaigning before voting begins. Regardless of your interest in the SA, we hope that everyone agrees our election process should seek to engage as many students as possible.

April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

state_press_2023_48,"Every day, Jewish students across the nation have to grapple with the possibility that being openly Jewish could negatively impact their safety. At ASU, this is no exception. When I get dressed in the morning, I put on my jewelry,and among the collection is my Star of David necklace. As I stare at the six-pointed star for a moment, countless thoughts race through my mind. Am I shoving my beliefs in everyone s face? I tuck the necklace into my shirt. Who cares what others think? I m proud of my identity. I untuck it. But are others? Am I putting my safety at risk? I tuck it in again. Perhaps I am. But isn t hiding who I am the very thing that those who oppose me wish for me to do? I place my necklace for all eyes to see and walk out of my room. My only regret is that I live in a time in which fear even crosses my mind. According to theAnti-Defamation League-Hillel campus antisemitism survey, nearly one-third of Jewish college students have experienced some form of antisemitism. About 31% of the students surveyed were witness to antisemitic incidents that did not directly involve them, such as hearing offensive comments and slurs or seeing offensive posters and logos. Over the past few years, there have been numerous instances of antisemitic ideas publicly espoused on campus. On Aug. 30, 2020, posters readingHitler was rightwere seen and reported by Jewish students. On Nov. 1, 2021, students were greeted with another poster, now featuring an antisemitic caricature of a vampire overlaid with text readingWho Controls The World? JEWS DO.Just weeks ago, an ASU student sanonymous submissionto the Instagram page for student advocacy group Jewish on Campus described the antisemitic language they encountered with a person in their friend group. In a new email, the@ASUCollege Republicans United chapter says they re considering an offer by the Students for Ye founder to host the antisemitic nazi lovers Nick Fuentes & Kanye West. CRU is a groyper student group & the AZ chapters have a history of hosting similar figurespic.twitter.com/u3nj03ZH23 College Republicans United held a meeting on Jan. 17 to determine whether or not it will invite notorious antisemites Kanye West and Nick Fuentes to speak on campus. The same group was also responsible for inviting white supremacist Jared Taylor to speak on campus in September 2022. Rather than preventing Taylor from speaking, ASU allowed him on campus, justifying that student organizations have the right to invite whomever they wish to speak. Additionally, duringa student forumin November 2022, University President Michael Crow used West as an example of a campus speaker that would be welcome if students could prove he would contribute to an intellectual discussion. While I admireASU s commitment to preserving First Amendment rights on campus, I believe splinter groups not officially recognized by the University should be not allowed to even invite speakers in the first place. READ MORE:State Press Play: Jared Taylor visit highlights on-campus frustrations, questions about speech at ASU At first glance, it seems as though ASU is a breeding ground for xenophobia, and that the University has not done enough to address it. While there has been an unprecedented amount of antisemitism on campus, it would be dismissive to say ASU has done nothing. I will be the first to admit that when I sat down to write my column, I was intent on pushing all of the blame for these acts onto the University. Initially, I thought the common denominator was ASU; however, that analysis is only surface level. In reality, there is no way for ASU to completely prevent these bigoted acts. Why do flyers keep popping up? Why do controversial speakers keep getting invited to spew harmful rhetoric? Why do people think it s OK to use antisemitic language when speaking to their Jewish peers? The answer to these continual, ever-increasing questions is the individual student and their lack of education about Judaism, Jewish culture and Jewish history. As unfortunate as it sounds, it isn’t exactly surprising that these bigoted beliefs are growing in acceptance. Since the end of World War II, the never again sentiment has been broadcast throughout the world. However, now that it has been 77 years since the end of WWII and Holocaust survivors, war veterans and even everyday citizens who lived during the Holocaust are passing away, people today may find that this crucial part of history, and the messages it carries with it, are no longer relevant. This couldn’t be further from the truth. As our society once again tries to rewrite the narrative of history, minimizing the genocide of 6 million Jewish people to just an unpleasant afterthought making up nothing more than half a chapter in a textbook, people are forgetting the crucial lessons that this period in history taught us. At the end of the day, ASU cannot control people s worldview. ASU cannot control whether or not a student puts up antisemitic flyers. ASU cannot control whether or not students try to get bigots to speak on campus. No matter how manystatementsare made by Crow denouncing antisemitism, xenophobes on campus will not be magically cured of bigoted thoughts. We live in a world of eight billion people, and unfortunately there are bad apples. We can t anticipate a lot of this, for the most part. I think we have to do what we control, which is our response and our mindset, said Jake Shulman, ASU Hillel s community experience specialist. We condemn the antisemitic rhetoric reported on campus on Nov. 1, 2021. There is no place for antisemitism, or any other form of prejudice, at Arizona State University. Please contact us at 480-965-3456 if you have any information about these flyers. In spite of the antisemitism ASU s Jewish community has endured, it continues to demonstrate immense resilience. In response to flyers posted around campus in November 2021, Jewish students held aprotestproclaiming pride in their Jewish identity. Furthermore, student organizations such as Hillel Jewish Student Center, Chabad Jewish Student Life at ASU and Olami at ASU continue to promote thriving Jewish life on campus. So, what can the University do? Simply put, it needs to continue what it is doing while providing more support as needed. The police have worked swiftly to remove the bigoted posters, while they and ASU s administrators have routinely denounced antisemitic acts perpetrated on campus. History does not simply repeat itself; rather, humans repeat history. We are at a turning point in our society, where we can either ignore the rising scourge of antisemitism or disrupt this return to a centuries-old status quo. As history has continually shown us, time does not heal all wounds, but action can. While ASU cannot directly abolish antisemitism on campus, students can still make a difference. If you hear or see something, say something, for complacency in the face of bigotry only aids bigotry. Edited by Piper Hansen, Reagan Priest, Sophia Balasubramanian and Caera Learmonth.

ubyssey_2023_20,"April 30, 2023 Written byUbyssey Editorial Board This editorial represents the opinions of the 104thUbysseyeditorial board whose term ends April 30, 2023. This time of year is filled with endings and new beginnings. The current AMS executives will leave office at the end of the month and be replaced by a new group, elected by you, the student body. The new execs are made up of both seasoned student politicians and student government newcomers. We atThe Ubysseyare familiar with our student society’s operations and the promises of the incoming AMS execs — we attended every debate and AMS Council meeting this past year. We’re familiar with the society s issues and where they’ve been lacking. In addition to our AMS knowledge, we talk to students and cover what they are struggling with. We believe we have a grasp on what students want and need from the AMS. So, as this editorial board s term comes to a close, we want to tell you (and the AMS what we hope to see this year. Students elect student leaders and pay student fees, so the issues students care about should be at the forefront of everything the AMS does. AtThe Ubyssey, we love transparency and we want to see more of it from the AMS. We’re hoping the AMS increases the visibility of AMS Council by publicly broadcasting meetings and allowing students to easily access AMS records. Right now, we are the only newspaper consistently keeping studentsup-to-dateon the operations of the AMS. And while we love our work, the AMS should take a more hands-on approach in ensuring students know what their student society is doing. And when it comes to records access, we want to see the AMS think about students first when it comes to revising their records policy. In October 2022, the AMSproposed changesto its records policy afterThe Ubysseyrequested access to redacted emails a month earlier. We wrote an editorial about this, and the AMS quickly backtracked. Of course, as journalists, we care a lot about being able to access records since it helps us hold the AMS accountable. But, all students who are part of the society should be able to access its records. We also want to see the AMS make its budget more transparent. This past year, there was no preliminary budget, and theMarch budget reforecastshowed discrepancies compared to the original budget. The AMS’s 2022/23 budget projected $4.2 million in revenue and a $1.25 million deficit, while the reforecast projected the society will make $4.7 million in revenue, with roughly a $481,000 deficit. We also want the AMS to consultIndigenous studentsregarding theAMS Sustainability Action Planand finish the Indigenous Coordination section of the plan. We want the AMS to ensure members of its executive team are familiar with the society’sIndigenous finance guidelinesand the AMS’s relationship with Musqueam. Thedebatesduring this year’s elections showed us this knowledge is lacking. Another knowledge gap during this year’s elections was around sexual misconduct policies and prevention — many candidates did not include details on how the society will support students through sexual assault. The AMS must also work toward solidifying survivor-centric frameworks when it comes to the review of policy PC1 and PC2, the AMS’sRespectful Community and WorkplaceandSexualized Violencepolicies. Students haveshown frustrationwith AMS this year. One way they could repair those relationships is by working with student activist groups on demonstrations, walkouts and other means of protest that matter to the student body. The AMS should also make sure it is listening to marginalized voices when the society’s actions willdirectlyimpact them. The AMS exists to advocate on the behalf of students, and it’s time they start doing so. We also want a kick-ass clubs fair with aFerris wheel. Just kidding.

crimson_2023_120,"Harvard needs an Ethnic Studies concentration. This was theoverwhelming consensusreached by College students in a 2021 survey — one that incoming President Claudine Gaytacitly began to work towardsas FAS Dean. But even the creation of a concentration would not be a catch-all solution to a far more deep-rooted problem: Harvard’s systematic neglect of ethnic studies in the social sciences. As a Government concentrator, I’ve felt this neglect firsthand, as it’s been a struggle to find ethnic studies courses that would count towards my concentration. In a recent interview, the Government Department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies, Nara Dillon, acknowledged to me the lack of Ethnic Studies courses within both the Government department and the College more broadly, expressing hope that recent hires could meet this need. In the meantime, Dillon said that the option for Government students to petition to count outside courses for elective credit offers a temporary fix. “We particularly try to give concentration elective credit in these petitions to cover gaps in our curriculum,” she told me. This message seems at odds withthe language of the petition for course credit itself, which explicitly states that courses taught in disciplines other than political science are “unlikely to be approved.” When asked for clarification, Dillon explained that “if about half of the course is political science, we ll go ahead and give concentration elective credit for it.” However, Dillon also noted that this approach can exclude students from credit-bearing options. “Almost every field these days uses this term ‘governance,’” she said. “Sometimes the theoretical perspective they’re coming at this issue of governance with is very different than what you would find in a political science course.” But Christina Shiao-Mei Villareal, a lecturer at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education and an expert in ethnic studies education, told me that she would strongly reject such distinctions. “Who has historically had a chance to define political science?” she asked. “Who has historically had a chance to even define the parameters of what a school of government is supposed to be, or government studies?” Villareal, who goes by “Dr. V,” was clear about the broader implications of being more concerned with semantics than representation. “We can’t take a term like academia for granted and continue to say, ‘We need to be accepted in academia.’ No, we need to fundamentally transform it,” she said. “Ethnic Studies does argue that the problem historically with academia was that it was absent of community, of action within surrounding communities.” Today, ethnic studies faces challenges far beyond the Government Department. This academic year, History & Literature counted 132 courses for credit in European Studies, as compared to 25 in Latin American Studies, while altogether failing to offer subfields for Indigenous, Middle Eastern, Pan-Asian, or Pan-African Studies. Even if these fields were to be created, the College’s area-focused history departments — that is, History, History & Literature, and History of Art and Architecture — only offer eight undergraduate-focused courses in Indigenous history, five in Latin American history, three in Middle Eastern history, nine in Pan-African history, and eight in Pan-Asian history. When including courses offered by other social science and humanities departments, these counts rise to 19 courses in Indigenous Studies, 26 in Latin American Studies, 11 in Middle Eastern Studies, 45 in Pan-African Studies, 59 in Pan-Asian Studies, and 110 in European studies. A total of 146 unique courses representing the entire non-white world is woefully inadequate when compared to the 110 courses that exist for European Studies alone. This disparity starkly illustrates the College’s prioritization of white academia. Notably, these course counts diverge from those offered by the History & Literature concentration and the Ethnicity, Migration and Rights secondary because my analysis does not include language courses offered in subfields — by intention. As Villareal recognized, there is a clear difference between language learning and Ethnic Studies, as the latter “has a very clear, politicized stance.” “If it is not focused on the project of decolonization, if it is not rooted directly in communities, if it is not intersectional,” she told me, then it’s not Ethnic Studies. While language courses may not necessarily teach ethnic studies content, it remains clear that such courses can open avenues for students to learn ethnic studies, as recordings of the histories and societies of people of color are far from limited to the English language. With that in mind, there is no denying the complete inadequacy of Harvard’s language course offerings. Filipino — the standardized form of Tagalog, currently the fourth most common language in the U.S. — will only be offered for thefirst time next semesterafter years of student activism. In contrast, even whenonly ten undergraduatesgraduated with a degree in the concentration in 2021-2022, Classics is seen as too intrinsically valuable not to teach. Don’t get me wrong; Harvard should offer Classics. But there is no excuse for treating the languages and histories of white people that have been dead for thousands of years as if they have more inherent value than those of billions of people of color today. When questioned on the lack of ethnic studies courses at Harvard today, administrators, including Dillon, have often offered the same sentiment: We’re hiring. This is certainly a welcome start; hiring Ethnic Studies faculty is essential. But it’s clear that hiring faculty alone can’t solve the underlying exclusion of ethnic studies from social science concentrations. While hiring more ethnic studies faculty is itself good, we don’t have to look far in the past to find promises of new hires that have gone awry. Professor Lorgia García-Peña was an Ethnic Studies scholar who had done everything right — she taught popular classes, had the trust of the student body, and was well-respected within her field. Her reward? She wasdenied tenurein 2019 and, in turn, was effectively fired from Harvard University. This decision was decried by students and academics alike, the latter of whom argued in a letter to President Bacow that the decision to deny García-Peña tenure would render the University unable “to respond to students’ growing interest in ethnic studies” and “to recruit and retain top faculty working in our fields.” The truth is, if we don’t tenure faculty like García-Peña, many such scholars will eventually reach Harvard’s eight-year limit for untenured faculty and find themselves forced out of the University’s gates. This creates an endless cycle of instability for ethnic studies at Harvard and renders the excuse that “we’re hiring” entirely inadequate. At the end of the day, a new Ethnic Studies concentration with more courses means nothing if interested students cannot easily take them — regardless of their concentration choice. When Ethnic Studies courses are relegated to specific subfields and concentrations, they become a sacrifice to take, no matter their relevance. Fixing this problem will require more than just tacking on an Ethnic Studies concentration — existing concentrations must move away from rigid, exclusionary systems, refocusing requirements around course relevance rather than department name. Doing so will allow students of color to take Ethnic Studies classes that not only accurately reflect their fields of interest but represent their identities, too. Such a representative education is essential but rarely available before college. In the U.S. public education system, under 10 percent of K-12 class time is spent on Black history; the taught histories of Indigenous people largely end in the 1800s; education on the Middle East is often limited to the context of war; and the histories of Latines, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders are often ignored entirely. Ethnic Studies not only teaches the experiences of people of color but also remedies centuries of untaught history. When asked if she would be in favor of counting courses for elective credit based on relevance rather than department, Dillon agreed, arguing that the Government department had already taken the unconventional step of requiring only 10 courses for the concentration “to promote flexibility and encourage students to take a wide range of courses in other departments as part of a liberal arts education.” This comes in contrast to other concentrations, which can require as many as 20 courses. Even still, joint anddouble concentrationsare commonplace, and it seems unlikely that students will find room for Ethnic Studies courses until they’re counted for concentration credit everywhere they’re relevant. Eric C. Henson, a lecturer at multiple of Harvard’s schools and research fellow at the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, recounted that for many of his students, particularly those at the Law School, his classes didn’t count towards their graduation requirements. According to Henson, since only five of his 27 students are degree-seeking from the school that offered his class, the perception of enrollment may be skewed. “It looks to the administration like you’ve got nobody showing up or caring,” he told me. Though there’s no denying that Harvard College needs an Ethnic Studies concentration, we can’t stop there. An Ethnic Studies concentration is a first step, but if it barely has any courses, what have we really accomplished? And even if we add ethnic studies courses, how much have we really changed if they’re only accessible for undergraduate students in a single concentration? While the promise of new Ethnic Studies hires is a start, we need more than promises — we need an Ethnic Studies department where professors are afforded the same degree of job security and basic respect as their colleagues in other departments via tenure. Further, to recognize the intrinsic value of ethnic studies, Harvard College should create an ethnic studies course requirement — stamping it as essential to an undergraduate education — similar toUCLA in 2015andPrinceton in 2020. Today, the College requires that undergraduates take one formal social science course under the Divisional Distribution requirement, as well two General Education courses exploring social science themes. It’s simple: If social science disciplines are incomplete without Ethnic Studies, as other institutions have recognized, then so are the College’s social science requirements. It’s been over 50 years since San Francisco State’s Third World Liberation Front firsttook up the picket linedemanding the eventual creation of thefirst Ethnic Studies departmentin the nation, but the fight for Ethnic Studies is far from over. Change has never come easily, but no politician, no university, no set of handcuffs, can rob Ethnic Studies of its legitimacy. Joseph W.

stanforddaily_2023_13,"Dear Readers, We are invitingapplicationsfor the relaunched Editorial Board of The Stanford Daily. There has recently been much conversation surrounding Stanford University on our campus and beyond; discussions about Stanford in its capacity as an educator, an employer, a provider of pastoral and physical care, a force in Silicon Valley, and a petri dish of future leaders. The Editorial Board will aim to break down these big issues with careful analysis and debate. We will investigate the facts and genuinely engage with the manifold perspectives behind any issue. We will work to not only examine the status quo but to construct a better path forward for Stanford, suggesting the actionable steps we must take to reach that future. The Board’s main purpose and goal will not be to complain; it will be to constructively advance discourse. To this end, the Board will meet weekly to discuss the most pressing issues on campus and relating to Stanford more broadly. We will collectively write weekly Opinions articles on these issues under a single byline,The Editorial Board. The Board will consist of 7 members in total, including experienced editors and writers from The Stanford Daily as well as members of the Stanford community. It is not an individual voice or opinion that will make the Board impactful, but a collective desire to improve this institution for its students, workers, faculty, and global impact. If you are someone with ideas for change, someone who enjoys critical debate and avoids the easy answers in favor of true understanding —applyto join the Editorial Board by Wednesday, April 5 at 10:00 p.m. Joyce ChenVol. 263 Editorial Board Chair Joyce Chen ‘25 is the chair of the Editorial Board for Vol. 263.

crimson_2023_33,"Walking into Kirkland House, I’m immediately overwhelmed by my surroundings. A chalkboard in the entryway informs me in rainbow lettering that “it’s ok 2 b gay.” Multicolored paper streamers blockade my entrance into the dining hall with their kaleidoscopic tassels. Doing my best to sidestep the meticulously hung decorations separating me from my meal, I walk through the doorway and am greeted with pride flags of what seems like every conceivable sexual orientation and gender identity. They line the perimeter of the space, obstructing walkways and casting long shadows across the tiled floor in unapologetic defiance of design etiquette. It’s excessive and inconvenient — and the sweetest display of allyship. I sit at a table ornamented with miniature pride centerpieces for a couple of minutes before I recall the rationale behind this unusual, campy parade of queerness: It’s Oct. 11, National Coming Out Day. I have a lot of complicated feelings about this35-year-old tradition— my opinions shaped in large part by the annual slew of “coming out” think pieces published each October. These personal essays and extended memoirs challenge the traditional framing of “coming out” as the pinnacle of queer self-actualization, addingdimension and nuanceto the LGBTQ+ coming-of-age narrative. As I reflect on these writings, it’s difficult to feel like I have anything novel to contribute to the “coming out” discourse. I exist on a campus replete with programming and support for LGBTQ+ people. If there’s any place where queerness is so sufficiently normalized that coming out is no longer relevant, it should be here, right? I’m not convinced that the answer is yes. Even at a progressive university like Harvard, the politics of coming out are not wholly insulated from a surrounding world that does not affirm queer people. As much as I would like to live in a society where being transgender or queer is as unremarkable as being left-handed, this is not the current state of affairs in the United States. Beyond the blatant homophobia and transphobia evidenced byrecord tallies of anti-LGBTQ+ legislationthis year, anti-queer sentiments pervade almost every facet of American life.Half of LGBTQ+ Americansexperience some form of harassment or discrimination at work, anda third of U.S, residents— among them thecurrent Speaker of the House— consider gay and lesbian relationships morally wrong. The same power dynamics that exist outside of campus exist within, and it is a disservice to queer students to suggest otherwise. Conversations about the politics of “coming out” may even be more relevant at a place like Harvard than they would be elsewhere, given the size of the queer population and the conditions of the campus climate. In a2021 Crimson survey of the Class of 2025(of which I am a member , more than 20 percent of students identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or another non-straight sexual identity. According to the same survey, 60.5 percent of incoming first-year students that did not identify as heterosexual reported not having come out. But Harvard’s aggressively queer-inclusive atmosphere means that many students, especially those from conservative backgrounds like myself, can arrive on campus with one belief about their identity and exit with another. Provided the safety to explore and express themselves freely, undergraduates may discover their capacity for love is greater than what they once imagined. However, this process of personal evolution that Harvard facilitates is not without complications. Students bring with them the biases and circumstances of the worlds in which they grew up, and, for many who are closeted or beginning to question their sexual orientation, these deeply internalized feelings of shame prove difficult to overcome. Likewise, many students face legitimate, well-placed fears of family retaliation and personal fallout that preclude their exit from the proverbial closet. This needless wrestle brought on by heteronormative society, while most damaging to students in the closet, can also adversely spill over and affect non-closeted peers as well — especially on a campus like Harvard’s with such a high concentration of LGBTQ-identifying students. What should be sweet and exciting, namely crushes and same-sex love, can be confusing and hurtful to the openly queer person who never receives confirmation of interest from a peer still working through their emotions. Instead, they are left to parse through plausible deniability and mentally litigate whether connections were real or imagined. Because of these myriad impacts of outness, until the rest of the world looks a little more like Kirkland House, the decision of whether to come out will continue to matter, even at — if not especially at — Harvard.

stanforddaily_2023_44,"In my nine years teaching at Stanford, I’ve been surprised often not to hear back from people I emailed at all levels, from the President to deans to professors to administrators to administrative assistants. Students and colleagues have told me their requests have also often gone unanswered. I’ve heard that this is common in academia. Universities should urge faculty and administrators to respond to all emails from others at their school. At Stanford Business School, where I teach practical writing, I warn: Why the big deal? From more than a decade in top management at a large company, and from talking with countless executives about their own businesses, I can tell you that email habits say a lot about the culture of an organization. Are people collaborative? For Stanford, this is particularly important now, because the Doerr School of Sustainability is new (and so very important , and needs support from other schools here. What troubles me even more: Replying is so much easier than it was in the days of pen and paper. “Smart reply,” using artificial-intelligence software to suggest answers, makes it simpler. And for more complicated answers, so do chatbots likeChatGPT, which millions have already tried. Look, I’m not an academic; I’ve worked for almost half a century in the private sector since graduating from Stanford in 1975. I was told when I began teaching at age 61 that academia would be very different from business, that interpersonal and teaching skills are less important than research and publication. It IS very different here. But most disappointing is the way many people deal with email. Yes, some at Stanford are admirably responsive. Howard Wolf — who as Alumni Director must deal with more than 235,000 living Stanford alumni, many of them as cranky as me — is one of them. And my Stanford Business School colleagues who have worked in business all say they always respond to Stanford emails. But too many are just the opposite. I try to help my students. Recently, I sent a short email to three people at the new Doerr School asking for a contact to spread the word about the students’ newsletter on career opportunities in climate tech. No response. I sent a similar email to people at the Engineering School. No response. That administrators at these schools didn’t reply to such a simple request – one that could benefit their students – gives me pause. I wonder: Are they aloof, arrogant and/or overwhelmed? Even if they’re not, they might appear to be. What kind of example does this set for students? This is by no means the first time I’ve emailed a suggestion to a Stanford dean, faculty member or other administrator without response. Even a two-second reply that said “Not interested” would be more polite than radio silence – what my students call “ghosting.” Better yet would be what we in publishing call a “nice no” – “Thanks, but no thanks.” Better still would be an attempt to engage. My former boss at The New York Times, Dean Baquet, tries never to say no. Instead, he says, “Yes, but how about….” Jeff Bezos at Amazon is famous forforwarding emailslike mine to the appropriate employee with just a “?.” He said in an interview: “I still have an email address customers can write to. I see most of those emails. I see them and I forward them to the executives in charge of the area with a question mark. It’s shorthand for , ‘Can you look into this?’ ’’ Eric Schmidt, who ran Google and has taught at my business school,has said: “There are people who can be relied upon to respond promptly to emails, and those who can’t. Strive to be one of the former. Most of the best—and busiest—people we know act quickly on their emails, not just for a select few senders, but to everyone.” Why can’t people at universities do that? Some have arguedagainst responding to so many emails, to preserve your mental health. “In these exhausting times, when so many are overburdened with family responsibilities, stress, grief and anxiety, perhaps we should let go of the outdated, demanding requirement to participate in ceaseless back-and-forth conversations,” wrote Erica Dhawan in The Times. I get it; we’re busy, and responding to lots of emails is hard. But if an email from someone with a connection to your school is written to you in particular — as opposed to just impersonally blasted to a bunch of people — it should be answered. As part of your job. Or, if you’re an alum, as an obligation to the school that brung ya. Sometimes we mean to reply but forget to. That’s why it’s always worth trying again – “bumping this up” or “just assuring you saw this.” But if after three emails, still no reply, we have a problem. I fear that in some cases, people don’t respond because the email isn’t written well. It should start fast — “bottom line up front,” as my students from the military say. It should be short. And polite. It should use conversational language and avoid jargon. It should try to make a warm personal connection. It should drop a name you know, or have someone you know make an introduction. It should sound confident but not arrogant. Humor helps. And the “ask” should be small and simple. How to assure compliance to a “please respond” recommendation? When I was in management, we made people’s pay contingent on compliance with our rules. Didn’t write those performance reviews? Your bonus would be cut. Didn’t search far and wide enough for the best candidate? Ditto. Seen as uncollaborative? Lose out on a promotion. I knew that if I didn’t respond to emails, I’d soon be selling apples on the street out front. And I don’t mean computers. I’m told it doesn’t work this way in academia. It should. We should be judged by how collaborative we are, not just on what we publish.

stanforddaily_2023_45,"With words of sacred scriptureI shield the oranges from the sting of phosphorousand the shades of cloud from the smog. I grant you refuge in knowingthat the dust will clear,and they who fell in love and died togetherwill one day laugh. —Hiba Abu Nada (1991-2023 Translated from Arabic by Huda Fakhreddine In 2021, the Palestinian American poet, translator and doctor Fady Joudah wrote: “I’ve long been aware of the crushing weight that reduces Palestine in English to a product with limited features, a perverse irony that revolves around the violence that Israel and the United States, culture and system, launch against Palestinians.” And later: “The overlap zone with Palestine in Arabic is not small, but the empathy field in English is malnourished.” These weeks we have witnessed the starkest reminders of this devastating lack. In the United States, mainstream journalists use their English to obfuscate Israel’s crimes against a besieged civilian population in Palestine. Their English cloaks the perpetrators, making them invisible to every logic that would damn them. Theysuggestthat Palestinians “die” while Israelis “are killed” and treat the occupied as terroristic and the occupier as reasonable and just. The atrocities of Oct. 7 are repeatedly framed in the context of hundreds of years of antisemitism. But Palestinians are not granted this historical view. Instead, people are chastised or worse when they mention the last 75 years of Israeli occupation or when they condemn U.S. support of the slaughter of Palestinians. Israeli officials wage war against “human animals” and “children of darkness,” familiar tropes meant to dehumanize. This genocidal language has gone largely unchecked by so many of our celebrated cultural and educational institutions. Rhetoric that should be met with denunciation and disavowal has instead been received with a cruel, festering, permissive silence — a silence that pledges its allegiance to one life and its disregard of another. It feels absurd to write to you of language when hour by hour the people of Palestinefaceannihilation. But here we are, bereft of the widespread condemnation of these unambiguous horrors. Where is the fire-language of protection for our Palestinian, Muslim and Arab beloveds with whom we are in community? Where are thegreennessesand blessings for the ones who speak, who fight? For me, the ongoing student sit-in at Stanford is a language unto itself, a collaborative practice that makes visible a presence of resistance, education and outrage in the face of such silence. These brave students of conscience have sacrificed their comfort in order to call us into dialogue at a time when so many are afraid to speak. It seems theirs is a vision of effortful togetherness, a patchwork of tents, tables and resources — an evolving grammar of grappling and disruption. The words of poet Rasha Abdulhadi fly through me: “Let the soft animal of your body get in the way of the death machines. Let the soft animal of your body make some safety for other people. Let the soft animal of your body refuse and disobey.” Protesters are rejecting the lie that all of our histories are unrelated and that this particular history is too complex to speak about if you support Palestinian rights and are not from the region. As Gwendolyn Brooks says, “We are each other’s business. We are each other’s magnitude and bond.” On this campus, I consider what the sit-in might mean to a range of students, staff and faculty who are themselves survivors of ethnic cleansing or genocide. While these histories of catastrophe are distinct, they also exist within an intricate web of relation. I am seized by the possibility that this sit-in, in addition to making clear students’ demands, also generates a signal of commitment to our shared humanity. *** The Palestinian poet Hiba Abu Nada —all blessings and wildflowers to her name— waskilledby an Israeli airstrike within days of writing the poem excerpted in the epigraph above. With these words, in the last days of her life, she protects the oranges and the shades of the clouds. Elsewhere, she blesses the children. She writes a future when even the dead will one day laugh, and with her language makes a refuge, a refusal and a shield. These are the words I think of when I meet the students in White Plaza or see their tents from a distance as I walk to meetings. These weeks we have seen student protesters refusing the regimes of silence that threaten to normalize mass killings. With their discipline, they shield action from despair. They are a greenness in the heart of campus, calling us to life. Aracelis Girmay is a poet and professor of English.

crimson_2023_32,"Midterms might be winding down, but the hustle is year round. On social media, Elon Musk declares that “nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.” On YouTube, motivational speakers pace the stage and tell us that we shouldn’t stop when we’re tired, we should stop when we’re done. On Instagram, self-help accounts splice together pictures of hustlers on jet skis next to non-hustlers in office cubicles (you, too, can become a jet ski guy, if you grind the right way and wake up at 5 a.m. every day! It’s not just an internet quirk: The hustle has made its way into the real world, where unpaid overtime seems to be a new company norm and phrases like “workplace burnout” have devolved into little more than tired truisms. To these hustlers, there’s nothing more romantic than sacrificing it all for success. They tell us: If you’re not relentless, fierce, and exhausted, you’re doing it all wrong. But there’s a slight problem. This way of fetishizing work, this idea that you can’t be successful without struggling like crazy, has become a masochistic obsession so deeply lodged into Harvard culture that we’re starting to believe that it might actually be true. At Harvard, we compete to see who can take on the most, hold up the longest, and hang by the thinnest thread. Because when the hustle is religion and we’ve become its devoted converts, the only proof of our faith is constant exhaustion. We’ve been programmed to take a twisted joy in saying that we got insert-psychotically-low-number hours of sleep. We skip meals to pset, and we smile at the dozen overlapping events on our calendars. We push ourselves to the breaking point. We actually relish it. Hard work is hard. That’s never been a question. But because of the hustle, we take it one step further and think that struggle is an absolute, non-negotiable, undisputed indicator for success — and that if we’re not struggling, there’s something deeply wrong with us. But when we think like this, we’re maintaining a thorny image of control when the working reality is much grimmer — because, before “rise and grind” was ever a mantra, it was a coping mechanism. At Harvard, it’s not an option to just chill — that was part of the fine print of what we signed up for. As former Yale English professor William Deresiewicz put itin his 2014 essay, “The prospect of not being successful terrifies them, disorients them.” (Them being us, unfortunately. According to him, we are simultaneously smart and anxious, talented and timid, driven and lost. We have a “violent aversion to risk.” We have “no margin for error.” After all, the very nature of admissions at institutions like Harvard, Deresiewicz writes damningly, is to select for a whole class of kids who don’t know anything but success and will stop at nothing to get it. The hustle knows this, and that’s why it keeps us running on treadmills in the highest gear, declaring that struggling will take us to the very top. And we sacrifice a lot to be there. A 2018report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropic public health organization, cited one of six major environmental conditions harming adolescent wellness as an “excessive pressure to excel.”Other studies have foundthat students in high-achieving schools can experience anxiety and depression at rates double or triple the national average. It’s all around us — we take on so many clubs, classes, and commitments that we leave nothing for ourselves. Hustle culture demands struggle. It’s entitled to it. So when we’re conditioned to think that sleep deprivation and burnout just come with what it means to be successful, we romanticize our overwork. We indulge the very toxic idea that there’s no alternative to success, that success and struggle are impossible to disentangle, and that to cope with this inevitable struggle, we have to love it. Even if — especially if — it consumes us. Zoe Yu ’27, a Crimson Editorial comper, lives in Wigglesworth Hall."
ubyssey_2023_21,"April 30, 2023 Written byTova GasterandMichelle Xie After decades of student pressure, dozens of universities across the continent have pledged to take portions of their investment funds out of fossil fuels. As of 2019,UBCis one of them. But as universitiescongratulate themselveson their divestment plans, they’re hiding something critical. Every year, oil and gas companies pour billions of dollars into university research — and often it comes with strings attached. A student-ledinvestigationfound significant UBC research is funded by fossil fuel companies — most prevalently in Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (EOAS . Since 2011, 509 papers published by UBC researchers have acknowledged fossil-fuel industry funding. The fossil fuel industry has funded at least $18 million dollars of research since 1999 — and that’s an underestimate, because UBC does not collect or publicize centralized data about the specific composition of industry research partnerships. We are concerned UBC continues to collaborate with fossil fuel funders in spite of its stated commitments toclimate justice. Students and staff fromPrinceton,Cambridge,Harvardand other schools are demanding universities not only divest their endowments, but cut ties with fossil fuel corporations entirely — including rejecting research funding and donations. It’s time for UBC to do the same. By donating to universities, fossil fuel companies get apublic image boostandinfluence over the researchtheir money funds. At this crucial juncture in addressing the climate crisis, Canadian universities collaborating with fossil fuel companies for research compromises our future. Some fossil fuel-funded research at UBC helps directly facilitate gas extraction; one example is a Shell and Chevron-funded researchprojectwhich developed new remote sensing technology for oil in the Gulf of Mexico from 2005–2017. Other fossil fuel-funded projects seem more environmentally-friendly. A large 2019–2021 oil-funded UBC research grant studied how to abandon gas wells — important research for a safe transition away from fossil fuel infrastructure. However, the project’s research donor Petroleum Tech Alliance — a large fossil fuel lobbyist group — boasts the explicit goal to “provide their industry with the social license to operate.” In a word, their mission is explicitly to make the fossil fuel industry look good. Meanwhile, Petroleum Tech Alliance’s partners continue to dig new oil wells and build new pipelines. Donating to environmental research makes it seem like Big Oil is doing their part to fix the problem they created — aliethat universities validate when their researchers end up relying on their money. Scientific research provides a roadmap to navigating the climate crisis. It helps us understand its scope and nuances, and outline which solutions could be most feasible — solutions which could save millions of lives. We cannot afford to allow fossil fuel money to skew understanding of what post-fossil fuel environmental futures are possible and how to get there. First, UBC departments, including EOAS, should conduct an internal review of their funding sources and partnerships and make this information publicly available. This follows precedents like the University of California’s policies around the tobacco industry — just as cigarette manufacturers shouldn’t be funding cancer research, fossil fuel producers shouldn’t be funding research into climate change. EOAS students have released anopen letterwith recommendations to bring EOAS’ actions in line with its stated values. That includes incorporating climate justice and Indigenous perspectives into curricula. It also includes making sure that fossil fuels aren’t using UBC environmental research to prop up their societal power. As student pressure continues to build, more attention is being brought to the issue of fossil fuel-funded research. Some universities are moving towards rejecting these partnerships and creating sustainable alternatives in both research and curricula. Last year, Princeton Universityvoted to cut all ties, including research partnerships, with the fossil fuel industry. More recently, amulti-university studyco-authored byData for Progressand theFossil Free Researchcoalition uncovered that a number of prominent American universities – including Harvard, Stanford and MIT – have received $700 million from Big Oil within a mere decade. Organizers have leveraged this information to fight for greater institutional accountability. The point isn’t to shame individuals. Money is tight and one of the principles of ajust transitionis to support abundant futures where workers — including publicly-funded researchers — can thrive and contribute to a post-fossil fuel society. Princeton is creating a fossil fuel-free research fund, called theEnergy Research Fundto replace lost fossil fuel financial support, and with support from the provincial and federal governments, UBC could adopt a similar approach. A just transition away from fossil fuel university funding is not only possible, but necessary. Fossil fuel companies are the architects of the climate crisis, and it s time that we stop letting them buy influence, prestige and legitimacy.

crimson_2023_121,"In a 1966 booklet called “College Admissions and the Public Interest,” B. Alden Thresher, the first ever director of admissions at MIT, laid out two approaches to higher education: the “poetic” and the “utilitarian.” While “utilitarian” students were “impelled by practical considerations,” their “poetic” counterparts took “innate pleasure” in learning. Well, Harvard poets are now few and far between:As of 2022, more than forty percent of working seniors go into either consulting or finance. That number jumps to 58 percent when you add in the technology sector. By comparison, employment in the nonprofit or public service sector sits below four percent. Many articleshave bemoanedthis trend of students “selling out,” but few have taken the time to quantitatively assess its origin. In this piece, I’m trying to do precisely that. I’m not intending to denigrate anyone’s career choices; I’m hoping to present a nonjudgmental sociological explanation. As Harvard transitioned from a patrician school to a seemingly meritocratic one, students increasingly began to view their degrees as financial investments, attempting to maximize return while limiting downside risk. It is this new, pecuniary approach to one’s college education that is to blame for the vertiginous increase in consultants and bankers. When Thresher was writing in the 1960s, Harvard was mostly white and rich. The school has, thankfully, diversified over time, and many point to this newfound diversity as causing the stark rise in students pursuing consulting and finance. Students that don’t come from familial wealth may be “disinclined to smell the flowers along the way and to take some chances,” said former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. But I think this change is more attributable to the culture of Harvard than to a demographic shift — for a few reasons. First, as I’ve written, Harvard isstill not particularly socioeconomically diverse: Only one-fifth of students come from the bottom 60 percent of the income spectrum. Even if each of these low-income students at Harvard in the 2000s and 2010s went into finance and consulting, that wouldn’t account for all the seniors choosing these career paths. Second, using data from The Crimson’s senior survey, I looked at whether parental income was correlated with career choice. As you can see, low-income students are comparatively much more likely to go into technology over finance. But the aggregate rate of selling out is about the same — around 60 percent — for all income brackets. Finally, there’s a tendency to overstate the role of money in students’ careers and ignore the culprit of prestige. The majority of Harvard students graduate debt-free — even English concentrators reported earning a median of six figures ten years after graduation. Meanwhile, a whopping 18 percent of Harvard graduates in 2011 applied to Teach For America, likely due in part to the program’s status and exclusivity. Although economic diversification may not be to blame for higher levels of selling out, changing admissions over the past 60 years have played an important role. While Harvard hasn’t gotten much more economically diverse, the school’s newfound commitment to meritocracy has set off a rat race that ends at the doors of McKinsey. Starting in the mid-20th century, Harvard shifted from a finishing school for patricians, to an embodiment of meritocracy — at least in brand. With today’s roughly 1 in 30 chance of a Harvard acceptance, the hustle starts early. A manic, frantic generation of kids spend fewer hours with friends and more time doing schoolwork, extracurriculars, and volunteering, trying to get into the colleges of their dreams. But getting into college isn’t the end. “They’ve been through a highly competitive series of tests and applications, and they want to succeed,” English and Comparative Literature professor James T. Engell ’73 said about Harvard students. “But then they look around and they look at what the measures of success are.” Having worked so hard to earn their spot here, students begin to chase their next marker of success. Although current undergraduates are still wealthy, their wealth is no longer a guarantee of success in an economy that increasingly values skills over connections. New York Times writer and former Crimson columnist Ross G. Douthat ’02 describes this trend: “In today’s meritocracy, the family fortune must be reconstituted in every generation. Even if you could live off your parents’ wealth, the ethos of the meritocracy holds that you shouldn’t.” But something is lost in all this busyness. An undergraduate degree, as Classics professor Richard F. Thomas told me, “is to prepare you to live an examined and meaningful life.” The constant chase of more success seems neither examined nor meaningful. By the time students get to Harvard, then, academics are often the least of their concerns. Instead, some view college as “a stepping stone rather than an end in itself,” as Engell put it. “If you go way back in time, when I was here, 1963 to ’67, people were much less focused on their eventual careers,” former Freshman Dean Dingman told me. Engell concurred: “It’s not that people didn’t think about that 50 years ago — of course they thought about it — but there was not, I think, the near obsession, or in some cases the obsession, with it.” The clearest example of Harvard’s careerist turn is its extracurriculars. Instead of being a way to “chill” or “get away from the academic stressors,” as Dingman says clubs used to be, student organizations — such as Harvard College Consulting Group and Harvard Financial Analysts Club — increasingly function as pre-professional outlets. These efforts often come at the expense of classwork, converting even the most poetic student into a utilitarian careerist. Research showsa long-term, national decline in hours devoted to schoolwork per week by college students. Here, too, Harvard seniors reported spending almost as much time collectively on extracurriculars, athletics, and employment as they spend on their classes. This stands in stark contrast to students’ old priorities. During Engell’s college years, he said, “it seems to me that the centerpiece for many students — not all — of their experience at Harvard-Radcliffe was the four courses they were taking each term.” Now, students are “more conservative in course choices,” according to Dingman. Risk-averse careerism has seeped into the choice of classes themselves. Many students now concentrate in fields like Economics or Computer Science to increase their job prospects. Their grades, too, have assumed an outsized importance due to increasingly competitive graduate school applications, according to Engell. I’ve seen it: My pre-law friend dropped out of a class after receiving a B+ on an essay, for fear of rejection from law school. This culture of pre-professionalism and risk aversion isn’t just an abstract pall hanging over campus. It’s also embodied by the constant physical presence of recruiters, who promise the job security that students are craving. The administration is arguably culpable in this process; students have complained that Harvard prioritizes industry jobs at the expense of the public service and nonprofit sector. Classics professor Thomas joked that “Goldman rents out the faculty club and has people there and has nice hors d’oeuvres and so on, whereas if you’re interested in public service, OCS will maybe have some Goldfish for you to munch on.” “That difference in worlds and difference in messaging is colossal,” he added. To Thomas’ point, the Office of Career Services is certainly not at fault for the culture created by recruitment-hungry companies. Ironically, though, the office was recently renamed the Mignone Center for Career Success after a large donation that came in part from an investment management firm partner. Every part of the recruitment infrastructure is meant to minimize risk. Interviews have moved earlier and earlier, and sophomores now often finish the academic year having already signed an offer for their senior summer. Students can relax knowing that they’ve precommitted, eliminating any career uncertainty. After all of this — getting into Harvard, joining pre-professional clubs, and doing the recruitment dance — even getting an offer isn’t the end. As Ezra Klein, another New York Times columnist,has argued, it’s precisely the temporary and noncommittal nature of these jobs that makes them attractive to students unsure of their preferred career trajectory. A case in point: Even though the percentage of Harvard graduates who go into consulting has increased sevenfold since 1969, the amount of students who pursue consulting as a permanent career has stayed relatively stable. The search for success continues. In transitioning from aristocracy to meritocracy, the ideal of a liberal arts education as a moral and intellectual pursuit was lost along the way. In its stead was left a breathless professionalism, one that instrumentalizes everything in its path for pecuniary gain. But glimmers of change are starting to appear. Enrollments in humanities classes are still high, even if humanities majors are down. Also, Emanuel Contomanolis, the director of the newly-renamed Mignone Center, wrote to me in an email that Harvard students are increasingly interested in environmentally conscious roles in finance, and consulting for public interest and nonprofits rather than for large private firms. So, while careerism has arguably put the classroom in the coffin at Harvard, perhaps we can find ways to keep up Thresher’s poetic tradition — even as we continue to sell out.

stanforddaily_2023_12,"To the editor: This is my first letter to Stanford since graduating in 1972. I don’t remember any politically polarized person being invited to speak at Stanford when I was a student there. We already had the world’s experts teaching on a variety of subjects. In a case like this, it would be best for the visiting judge to sit down in a group and have a Goethean discussion, with each person’s comments adding to the comments before, with the intent to arrive closer to truth. That being impossible, where such a large group was interested in either cheering on or opposing the ideas of the judge, it would have been better to have a true debate, with someone of equal stature having the opposite point of view on stage debating the issue with the visiting judge. The audience would not only learn about true debating but be able to judge the winner. Shame on you Stanford for setting up a forum that was likely to end the very way it did.

crimson_2023_65,"This op-ed is part of a special opinion package, “Antisemitism at Harvard, According to Seven Jewish Affiliates.”View the full package here. For eighteen years I had the great privilege of working as Executive Director of Harvard Hillel. As a leader of Jewish communities on campus, in New England, and around the nation, I have helped cultivate a new generation of Jewish leaders and citizens. I navigated moments of tension and war: the tumultuous 1990s, as the Oslo Accords began to crumble; the Second Intifada; 9/11 and its fallout; the Iraq War; Israel’s Second Lebanon War and its war on Gaza in late 2008. During my long career as a Jewish educator and leader — including thirteen years living in Jerusalem — I have seen and lived through my community’s struggles. Now, as an elder leader, with the benefit of hindsight, I feel compelled to speak to what I see as a disturbing trend gripping our campus, and many others: The cynical weaponization of antisemitism by powerful forces who seek to intimidate and ultimately silence legitimate criticism of Israel and of American policy on Israel. In most cases, it takes the form ofbullying pro-Palestine organizers. In others, these campaigns persecute anyone who simply doesn’t show due deference to the bullies. The recenteffort to smearour new University President, Claudine Gay, is a case in point. I applaud the decision by the Harvard Corporation tostand by Dr. Gayamid the ludicrous charges that she somehow supports genocide against Jews, and I hope Harvard will continue to take a clear and strong stance against any further efforts by these powerful parties to meddle in university affairs, especially over personnel decisions. The toppling of the president of the University of Pennsylvania is a sobering example of what can happen when we empower these unscrupulous forces to dictate our path as university leaders. The stakes are as high as they’ve ever been. Our vigilance must be up to the task. As a leader in the Jewish community, I am particularly alarmed by today’s McCarthyist tactic of manufacturing an antisemitism scare, which, in effect, turns the very real issue of Jewish safety into a pawn in a cynical political game to cover for Israel’s deeply unpopular policies with regard to Palestine. (Arecent pollfound that 66 percent of all U.S. voters and 80 percent of Democratic voters desire an end to Israel’s current war, for instance. What makes this trend particularly disturbing is the power differential: Billionaire donors and the politically-connected, non-Jews and Jews alike on one side, targeting disproportionately people of vulnerable populations on the other, including students, untenured faculty, persons of color, Muslims, and, especially, Palestinian activists. Let me speak directly to Jewish students at Harvard. I know that it’s alienating and hurtful to so many of you when campus Jewish organizations, like Hillel and Chabad, take positions that exclude your voices. To those students, I say: The Jewish tradition is much deeper than any organization. No one has a monopoly on Judaism. Continue to learn Torah, Jewish history, and our ethical traditions. Continue to draw from these sources — your sources — to find yourself, to build community, to build your own power, and even to build your own Jewish organizations. Be boldly critical of Israel — not despite being Jewish, but because you are. There is no tradition more central to Judaism than prophetic truth-telling, no Jewish imperative more urgent than bravely criticizing corrupt leadership, starting with our own. As someone who spent over forty years running programs in which Jews, often young people, were under my care, the safety of Jews has always been my highest priority — and, frankly, the thing that keeps me up at night. I have myself been the victim of antisemitism, including, on more than one occasion, serious violent attack. I know what antisemitism looks like and I do not take the issue of violence against Jews lightly. I have monitored, with vigilance, the kinds of speech that Israel-aligned parties are calling “antisemitic,” and it simply does not pass the sniff test. Let me speak plainly: It is not antisemitic to demand justice for all Palestinians living in their ancestral lands. The activists who employ this language, and the politics of liberation, are sincere people; their cause is a legitimate and important movement dissenting against the brutal treatment of Palestinians that has been ongoing for 75 years. One can disagree with any part of what these activists say, but they must be allowed to speak safely and afforded the respect their morally serious position deserves. I have learned much by listening and carefully considering the positions of these activists. If Israel’s cause is just, let it speak eloquently in its own defense. It is very telling that some of Israel’s own supporters instead go to extraordinary lengths to utterly silence the other side. Smearing one’s opponents is rarely a tactic employed by those confident that justice is on their side. If Israel’s case requires branding its critics antisemites, it is already conceding defeat. Let me be clear: Antisemitism in the U.S. is a real and dangerous phenomenon, most pressingly from the alt-right white-supremacist politics that have become alarmingly mainstream since 2016. To contend against these and other antisemitic forces with clarity and purpose, we must put aside all fabricated and weaponized charges of “antisemitism” that serve to silence criticism of Israeli policy and its sponsors in the U.S. As a Jewish leader, I say: Enough. Bernie Steinberg was the executive director of Harvard Hillel from 1993 to 2010."
rice_thresher_2023_5,"ByElisabeth Torres-Schulte1/10/23 9:48pm Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. A choice, by definition, must be between two or more possibilities. As I read about Rice’s Reproductive Health Working Group in the Thresher’s Nov. 30 Special Project, I’m struck by the fact that only one response to student pregnancy was presented. Reproductive health is not limited to contraceptives and abortions, but also includes prenatal, postnatal and maternal care and it is critical that the RHWG include these elements in their priorities. For Rice to be pro-choice means that it supports students regardless of their choice, and while some might choose to procure an abortion, others may choose to keep their child. Presently, Rice is woefully unequipped to deal with student pregnancy, especially at the undergraduate level. With Texas’s total ban on abortion, the university needs to reckon with the fact that its students will get pregnant, and some will choose to have the baby. At the graduate level, students may apply for a six-week parental leave after birth or adoption, with an option to extend the leave for an additional six weeks due to health complications. While students are released from their academic responsibilities during their leave, they are expected to complete all the semester’s coursework upon their return. There does not seem to be a formal policy for undergraduates. Title IX prohibits discrimination against pregnant and parenting students (students cannot be expelled, kicked out of the dorms before the infant is born or lose financial aid due to pregnancy , but it is vague on what accommodations are necessary. Typical accommodations include larger desks, bathroom breaks, access to lactation rooms and excused absences or flexible deadlines for medical reasons. I believe Rice could go well beyond that and follow the lead of other universities who offer highly subsidized child care or even free housing to parenting students. Rice can also mobilize its student body to support parents, such as by offering volunteer babysitting opportunities or expanding the meal-swipe donation program to better accommodate families. It is not only students that Rice can support with improved family policies. While full-time, benefit-eligible faculty who are primary caregivers can receive up to one semester of leave at full pay, this benefit is not offered to other Rice employees. While Rice Children’s Campus is a fantastic resource offering convenient, high quality education for preschoolers of current Rice affiliates, it’s on the more expensive side and is inaccessible to many. One fifth of American undergraduates are parents, and they are not supported. 61% of student fathers drop out of college, along with 41% of student mothers, yet those who do graduate have higher average GPAs than their peers. Parenting students are a valuable group in education, and the solution isn’t getting rid of them — it’s making sure they’re cared for. Rice claims it wants to increase its enrollment and diversity, yet neglects this demographic. It touts a Culture of Care, but fails to foster a culture that cares for families. If “Abortion Through the Ages” shows us anything, it’s that Rice students will face unplanned pregnancies. What if Rice went far beyond contraception vending machines, and truly supported students, no matter which way they chose? April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

state_press_2023_49,"The H.B. Farmer Education Building for the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College on Thursday, Oct. 13, 2022, in Tempe. The Arizona Teachers Academyrecently received $15 million to fund more tuition scholarships given to teachers if they stay in Arizona. This measure attempts to addressArizona s worsening teacher shortageby covering thetuition costs of aspiring teachers. Although well-intentioned, increasing teacher scholarships is a laughable Band-Aid solution that fails to resolve Arizona s escalating teacher crisis. David Berliner, a Regents professor emeritus in theMary Lou Fulton Teachers College, stresses that providing resources for students to go to college in itself is beneficial. However, he posits that infusing money into scholarships is not an ideal strategy if the goal is to improve teacher retention. The college degree is good, but even if (students go into teaching they will leave in a couple years because the status and pay are very poor, Berliner said. The respect isn t there and the pay as a teacher is not there. Observing these working conditions caused Sierra Pitlick, a former education student at ASU, to switch her major to psychology. You see people who are doing the job you want to do and you can tell how much they really don t want to be doing it anymore, she said. I would rather save myself the major disappointment of thinking, Oh, I can do it anyway, and then a couple years down the line being like, Oh wow, they were right this was not at all what I was hoping for. Pitlick added that she is now paid as much, if not more, in her current entry-level position than if she continued on to be a teacher. Berliner cites this unfortunate reality as the heart of the teacher retention issue. The root of everything is decent pay, he said. It s false to think you can get (students into the college track to get teaching credentials and then retain them. It’s not a job that you can love if you don t have respect and pay. Pitlick expressed similar skepticism about tuition scholarships as solutions to Arizona s teacher crisis. I ve never really heard people complain about the tuition that they have to pay, she said. It s the (other costs of the job. Minimal pay is only part of the package. Paying out of pocket for school supplies and taking on extra hours to assist schools extracurricular programs are among the additional financial and temporal expenses that teachers take on, according to both Pitlick and Berliner. Across Arizona, teachers face short staffing, burnout and insufficient support on top ofearning 20% less than peerswith similar educational backgrounds in other fields. Add managing students and dealing with uncooperative parents to the melee and the teacher landscape ends up resembling more of a perpetually losing battlefield than a classroom. Responding to this grim and ongoing crisis by trying to bribe students to become teachers brilliantly exemplifies the circular reasoning that has characterized Arizona s deficient education policy for so long. After all, what student would want to leap headfirst into teaching if the working conditions are only worsening? If, once they exit college with a diploma in their hands, they will make less money, work more hours and get less respect than their non-teacher peers? No amount of tuition money is worth exchanging a potentially livable future for the soul brutalizing job that is teaching in Arizona. Instead of throwing money into paying teachers tuition, maybe it s time to put the money into cutting better paychecks. Edited by Piper Hansen, Reagan Priest and Anusha Natarajan.

crimson_2023_137,"On April 11, nearly 5,000 students at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences were greeted with an unwelcome surprise: Our schoolwas renamed the Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, effective immediately. After almost a year of celebrations for our 150th anniversary, the announcement was jarring, to say the least. Since then, much has been written about how members of our communityfind Kenneth C. Griffin ’89’s ideological affiliations to be in conflict with our core values. But my objective is not to belabor those points. Instead, I want to explain why the way these events transpired was deeply unjust and hurtful. As Shakespeare said, “that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” Though its name changed overnight, our school’s people and their values haven’t changed. From this perspective, our frustration might seem unwarranted. Yet every single person I’ve spoken to at GSAS — students, alumni, and administrators — has expressed a deep sense of injustice and hurt. This is because names do more than allow us to refer to people or things: Who and what we choose to honor in a name also expresses a commitment to values and causes, which can guide future action. Thus, if we respect existing members of the community as stakeholders, they should be included in the decision-making process for something as monumental as the entire community’s renaming. And you don’t have to take it from me. In a 2020 message to the FAS community regarding the Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard President-Elect Claudine Gay described the Harvard administration’s process of deciding who and what to memorialize, writing: “Honest and rigorous conversations about how we weave together our past, present, and future through our visual culture and symbols are necessary to build the stronger, more equitable future we envision.” And yet, without any “rigorous conversation” with GSAS students, those same administrators changed our name — the most public “symbol” of our school. This raises the question: How was such a blatantly unjust decision allowed to happen, and why did it happen to us? For the past three years, I’ve worked alongside many student leaders and administrators to improve GSAS students’ lives as a GSAS Student Center Fellow, as an executive on the Graduate Residence Hall Council, and as the secretary, vice president, then president of the GSAS Student Council. I’m sad to say that no one I work with was surprised that we were abruptly renamed. For as long as I’ve been a leader, GSAS students told me that they feel like second-class citizens at Harvard. And that’s by design: An administrator explained to a group of us recently that we can’t expect equal treatment with the College because alumni of the College donate more money. We see this dynamic play out every day. For instance, when GSAS students were pushed out of the College House system in 2019, we lost access to intramural sports. This hurt: Athletics are an invaluable way to build community and promote mental health, somethingmany graduate studentsstruggle with. Since then, we’ve consistently pushed for athletic opportunities, but made little headway. Students resort to workarounds like cross-registering at MIT just to get access to athletic facilities because Harvard Athletics won’t let our groups use theirs. And although the University committed to creating a graduate IM league by Fall 2021, the single staff position charged with leading that effort was not filled until October 2022. Another thoroughly exhausting fight has been about renovating the GSAS Student Center at Lehman Hall, the only space GSAS students can call their own. Much needs to be done: For example, many wheelchairs can’t fit in the building’s elevator, and a lack of power outlets makes it difficult to work there. A 2021-22 feasibility study included concrete plans for renovation. But despite our support, it has been frustratingly difficult to get any indication of when — or even if — they might be approved. Recently, we learned that the plans would be delayed by another year. Yet, Harvard hasalready spent over $800 million renovating the College Houses. The amount proposed to renovate Lehman Hall is a small fraction of that. This history makes us incredibly skeptical about how much of Griffin’s $300 million gift will go into supporting GSAS directly as opposed to FAS or the College. Yet it’s us who got renamed, reinforcing the message that we’re worth less to Harvard. We’re reminded of this message every time we see the new name. A particularly painful downstream effect of the renaming is that our student groups and programs will likely have to be renamed accordingly. For example, Figure Skating@GSAS, a group that means a lot to me personally as a symbol of our commitment to student wellbeing outside of academics, will most likely become Figure Skating@Harvard Griffin GSAS. None of our traditions or sacred spaces will be left unscarred. I’m not writing this with the intent to push for a particular solution. I don’t know if there’s a good one. But students at GSAS and the administration need to talk. The GSAS community deserves to know how the decision to rename us was made, and how the gift will benefit GSAS. We need Harvard to acknowledge the hurt that has been inflicted upon us, and to commit to conversations going forward not only to address that hurt but also to prevent similar injustices in the future. Surely, we deserve that much. Zachary Lim is a fourth-year student at the Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the President of the GSAS Student Council."
ubyssey_2023_37,"March 6, 2023 Written byUbyssey news staff All year, we’ve been attending governance meetings and keeping an eye on what’s going on in the AMS, Senate and Board of Governors. We’re familiar with the issues and the pressures of each position in student government. This elections season, we talked to all the candidates, attended all the debates and fact-checked their claims and platforms. Here’s the result. We’re not here to tell you who to vote for, but we will be honest about each candidates’ strengths and weaknesses. Behold,The Ubyssey’s guide to all of the 2023 AMS Elections candidates. ChatGPT is an AI software. While it can tell a good joke, its ability to engage with students meaningfully and with empathy is unclear (again, it is a software program, not a person . It also was not able to participate in debates due to a ban on technology, which raises questions on how it will interact with students. While it understood policies and issues facing the AMS to an extent, it made some factual errors in its interview withThe Ubyssey— despite its claims to being all-knowing (because again, it’s an AI program . Du is the status quo candidate in this race with the most experience. As VP admin, he has rebuilt relationships between clubs and the AMS. His idea to conduct an audit of AMS businesses to lower food prices and find ways to partner with local and BIPOC-led businesses is fresh. But, the rest of his platform seems to be an extension of his VP admin goals, like making Clubs Fair bigger and better with a ferris wheel. His idea to improve the consultation process on the AMS/GSS Health & Dental Plan also isn’t groundbreaking and while he said he is voting in favour of both referenda, he voted against Trans students’ push to combine the two health care referenda this year. Despite their name, Remy the Rat is running as a serious candidate this year. If last year’s campaign saw Remy calling the shots, this year Esmé Decker is in control of the kitchen. Remy/Decker has a lot of good ideas that would bring a new perspective to the AMS, notably around the student society’s relationship with RBC. And while they do not have experience working within the organization — which sometimes showed during debates when they said their opponent Ben Du knew more on some things — their work with student advocacy clubs will provide a solid foundation for them to represent student interests. Kumar’sexperience in club executive positions gives her firsthand experience with the shortcomings of the current VP administration office — which could help if elected. She plans on addressing gaps in engagement by focusing on student visibility and inclusivity, but how they plan to carry this out is a bit unclear. Kumar’s only concrete plans are holding weekly in-person forums with student groups. However, the debates showed Kumar’s passion about incorporating more equity, diversity and inclusion-oriented training programs for student clubs and constituencies — even if she lacks some policy knowledge, specifically about the AMS Sustainability Action Plan. Awotundeclearly has a passion for improving the student experience. But her platform lacks some specifics, showing a potential misunderstanding of the VP admin role. She does have some relevant experience from serving in student leadership of an undergraduate club or serving as a youth mentor for the UN Association in Canada. But these experiences seem best suited for external student advocacy — and the VP admin role is inward facing. While Awotunde could learn about the VP admin role if elected, there might not be enough time in a one-year term to complete everything on her to-do list. Caguiathas extensive student leadership experience, from Arts Undergraduate Society VP administration to AMS AVP academic and university affairs. Although his ideas seem to be building off of existing initiatives, it is clear he knows the inner workings of the AMS, and possesses the operational knowledge to execute his platform. Expanding the Nest s accessibility is a guiding force for his campaign — from improving room booking requests to revitalizing the Commons Lounge into an upper-year collegium. He also has had the most to say about sustainability and Indigenous coordination during the debates, which is something the current VP administration portfolio is lacking. Lu’spassion for the VP admin role grew through the campaign, demonstrated by her performance in the two debates. It’s clear Lu put in the work to find out what clubs and constituencies need by speaking to different students about their experiences. But as a new student, Lu lacks some experience, and while she talked about CampusBase’s deficiencies more than any other candidate, she has knowledge gaps in other areas of the role. Lu also questioned the necessity of some clubs, saying that some were taking up resources that would be better-used by other clubs. Sawatzky’splatform focuses mainly on reviving campus life with “fun and engaging events.” Sawatzky shows a willingness to learn more about the VP admin portfolio and wants to advocate for clubs to reduce reimbursement processing times, something that former VP admins and VP finances have strived toward. But, Sawatzky’s limited experience with clubs is reflected in his platform, which has fewer specifics on administrative aspects of the job. He might have challenges when it comes to the management side of this portfolio, but if you want a candidate that cares about fun, he’s the guy for you. Mishraseems passionate about working as the VP finance and has experience working with the AMS as the events coordinator and the events ambassador for AMS Events. His platform focuses on improving communication and accountability, securing long-term funding for the AMS Food Bank and supporting students with off-campus housing. He is also keen on clearing the backlogs of club reimbursements. He has some new ideas like raising funds for the AMS Food Bank through AMS Events, but their feasibility remains to be seen. However, he has some knowledge gaps on the AMS Indigenous Finance Guidelines, the AMS/GSS Health & Dental plan referenda and the AMS’s deficit. Zheng, the current AMS associate VP finance and former Arts Undergraduate Society VP finance, brings a lot of experience with the finance portfolio. She seems to have realistic goals and was able to answer most questions during the VP finance debate in a concrete manner. However, most of her ideas have been explored by past candidates. Also, she lacked a concrete plan to financially help students with housing. Nevertheless, it seems that her knowledge would help her assume the role at a time when AMS is dealing with budget deficits, club reimbursement backlogs and the depleting health and dental reserve. Kanjihas extensive experience within the AMS and VP academic and university affairs office, thanks to his time on the AMS Advocacy Committee and as the strategy and governance lead. Kanji seems passionate about advocating for students, and he aims to address pressing issues like affordability, equity and open educational resources. Notably, he lacked details on how he would advocate for sexual violence policies, which he was also criticized for when he ran last year. If Kanji accomplishes his goals, he could deliver for students, but his platform does not bring many new ideas. Tongis running uncontested for VP external. While Tong is aware of many of key issues like food security, housing and affordability, her lack of advocacy experience will likely be a challenge if she is elected. During the campaign she demonstrated a lack of familiarity with public administration, and during the debate she seemed to be unaware of police violence faced by marginalized communities (although she has since issued an apology , among other knowledge gaps regarding housing and provincial sexual violence policy. Her platform indicates a misunderstanding of the difference between VP external and other roles on the AMS executive, and her being out of touch with social justice demands means she would likely be unable to advocate for the interests of all students if elected. After two years as an AMS executive and three years as student senator,Bhanguknows her policy. She distinguishes herself from the other candidates with specific, realistic plans for the Board and would likely perform similarly to this year’s representatives. Bhangu has championed affordability for students as a member of the Student Affordability Task Force. However, it’s unclear whether Bhangu could improve student engagement. She has had difficulty consulting with student groups in her time as president, leading to several public confrontations at AMS Council. Bhangu says she wants to engage students through constituency channels, the ones she knows best, but that seems to leave out the students who have been protesting at Board meetings this year. Hassibis a passionate advocate on social justice issues, but still has some learning to do on UBC policy. He has clear positions on increasing housing supply and divesting from companies involved in human rights violations, but he seemed to fall back on these points during debates when he couldn’t directly respond to questions. His background as an activist means the structure of the Board will likely limit his goals no matter what, but he would be a strong advocate for his positions. It’s easy to be skeptical about plans for social media engagement, but Hassib has a micro-influencer amount of Instagram followers that could make it work. Razia has realistic plans on affordability and food security. She also has passion for community work, demonstrated by her leadership roles in several clubs. But Razia lacks some specific policy knowledge and made some factual errors in debates. Her Senate and Board platforms are also quite similar. Other ideas of Razia’s may not succeed in a single term — in particular her plan to increase student seats on Board, considering it would require amending the University Act. It’s also unclear how Razia’s plan to implement informal polling will increase engagement as students are already saying they face survey fatigue from UBC. Wang brings UBC knowledge from his time as a student senator, but lacks understanding of what the Board does outside of its finance committee. He wants to bring more equity, diversity and inclusion to UBC through his work on the Board, but it’s unclear how he would represent a majority of students while supporting incremental tuition increases — which 92 per cent of students opposed in this year’s tuition engagement survey. Wang also does not have a public platform and could not attend either debate, leaving us with questions about who he is and what he stands for. As a PhD student, Odenigbo has a unique vantage point on university governance, and he was the only candidate to discuss graduate research funding unprompted. He also has experience in the GSS which informs his proposals for housing aid and gives him financial experience the other governance newcomers lack. Beyond financials though, Odenigbo’s platform lacks some specific policy knowledge and awareness of the limits of the Board’s power. Also, his plan to get the Board to forcibly follow general student opinion shows ambition, but realistically it’s unlikely he could get this done. Hajizadeh is a qualified candidate not only as an incumbent, but through her roles last year as co-chair of the Student Senate Caucus and vice-chair of the Agenda Committee — which showed in her confidence during the debates. Experience and institutional knowledge may count for a lot in an election cycle when there will be many new faces elected. While much of her campaign borrows heavily from what she promised last year in terms of student engagement and increased equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives, she brings a strong track record of engaging with and advocating for student issues. Hassibis a fresh face to student governance, although he has a background in political organizing and is clearly passionate about his values. He brings a progressive and action-focused lens to the Senate race, focusing on issues of accessibility and reconciliation through platform points like making it compulsory for all professors to record their lectures and pushing for mandatory Indigenous courses in all degree programs. Delivering on these ambitious promises could prove to be challenging as Hassib may be hindered by UBC’s commitment to academic freedom and his lack of experience in a slow-moving body that relies on procedure and bureaucracy. Hobrings years of experience in different student governance roles, like serving as an AMS Councillor, and has clearly engaged with the materials and issues presented in these positions. Ho has a history of identifying and understanding the type of work that can be done under the Senate portfolio, and his platform is well-researched and achievable. While Ho’s answers at the debate were sometimes circuitous, their substance demonstrated a strong understanding of the issues behind the questions being asked. Student senators work as a team, and Ho would contribute valuable institutional and policy knowledge to the caucus. Irfanhas considerable experience with student governance in her previous role as the AMS representative for the Faculty of Arts, as well as a position in the Arts Undergraduate Society as a BIPOC coordinator. Like her previous work, her campaign has a specific focus on equity-based initiatives, like recognizing more religious holidays in the UBC academic calendar and including a mandatory Indigenous course. Her adamance for consistent communication with UBC’s numerous BIPOC and religious organizations, as well as the improvement of the Senate’s transparency, are foundational to her platform and she seems to have a strong understanding of where and how the Senate could improve on these things. Kanjiis running to continue his appointed position on the Senate. He has experience within the AMS from his time on its Advocacy Committee and as the strategy and governance lead. His platform has an abundance of policy change goals — like advocating for more open education resources and adjusting Campus Vision 2050 to include more quiet spaces on campus. He also has specific plans to improve communication with the student body. However, he didn’t achieve this goal in the last term — on the basis that he did not have enough time to do so. With his background in student advocacy,Lihas the toolkit to complete a smooth jump from the Science Undergraduate Society to the Senate. While he isn’t proposing transformative ideas, his platform demonstrates a good grasp of student concerns, like increased lecture accessibility and lowering the cost of learning. During the debate, Li’s newcomer status showed when he could not recall particular details of specific Senate policies. However, he has demonstrated an ability and a willingness to learn. Overall, Li is a candidate who acknowledges his strengths and weaknesses which could be a solid asset in the Senate. Raziahas the passion and the desire to advocate for her peers for years to come and has served as the first-year representative for the Science Undergraduate Society. However, she only displayed a surface-level understanding of Senate workings, often stumbling over policies and their contents. Razia’s platform is very student-focused with affordability, education and student engagement as core ideas, demonstrating her enthusiasm for improving student life. But, her lack of experience in student governance may hinder her ability to deliver on her promises. Overall, Razia is a promising candidate but may face too steep of a learning curve this year.

wildcat_arizona_2023_11,"Last spring, I wrote anarticleabout why I chose the University of Arizona and how it was the right choice for me. I have some revisions. When I wrote the article, I was sure that the UA was for me and I loved so many things about the college. Then, last semester happened. Two instances stick out: theOct. 5shooting and death of professor Thomas Meixner and the harassment of a fellowDaily Wildcatopinions writer over anarticle. The university did nothandleeither situationwell. There were also multiple shootings around campus and at the high-rise apartments across the street from campus. On Oct. 6, students and faculty returned to campus as if nothing had happened. There were still news trucks outside the John W. Harshbarger building when I walked to class less than 24 hours after the murder occurred. We were given no time to grieve and process the tragedy that rocked our community. We need to be able to trust the people who are supposed to protect us. After the shooting, my mental health tanked, and I felt unsafe going to my classes. I know I was not the only one, as survivors of school shootings oftenexperiencePTSD, depression and anxiety.Also, students’ attendance rates and test scores drop. School shootings do not only affect victims, they impact everyone in the community. When a fellow writer published an article about a well-known TikToker, I was thrilled that she could express her mind. I was appalled when she told me about the death threats and other heinous comments she received. The UA dean of students did seeminglynothingto help her with the aftermath. The writer should not have been going through the harassment alone, and the university should have stepped in when it happened. I am a sophomore, but I plan on graduating a year early because I cannot wait to get away from this university. College is supposed to be the “best years” of your life, but over the past few months it has become apparent that it will not happen. I have opened the transfer portal more times than I can count, but I can’t leave because some of my credits will not transfer. Mental health issues have recently increased among college students, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the American Phycological Association, about60%of college students experienced some type of mental illness in the 2020-21 school year, and, according to Bloom Health Centers,21%of counseling center students have experienced serious mental health concerns. Students are under a lot of stress, contributing to their mental health issues like depression and anxiety. With the added stress of wanting to transfer, students’ health can plummet. There are many other things wrong with the UA, but I had missed them, especially during my freshman year because I was in a little bubble that did not want to believe I had made the wrong decision for college. Looking back at writing my old article, I did not realize I could criticize the university, but now I’m not afraid to do it. The people who have the power to change, the president and the provost, should be doing more for their students. Colleges are supposed to protect their students and make sure the campus is a safe environment for everyone. Things need to change for people to feel safe. I don’t think I could ever trust the UA fully and fully love being a student here again. Follow Kelly Marry onTwitter Kelly Marry (she/her is a sophomore studying journalism and public relations.

ubyssey_2023_5,"Nov. 1, 2023 Written byHicham Safieddine Dr. Hicham Safieddine is an Associate Professor in the Department of History and the Canada Research Chair in the History of the Modern Middle East. Gaza is burning. It is a children’s graveyard, and the digging hasn’t stopped, courtesy of the Israeli military machine. On Tuesday, a despairing director at the New York office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rightswrote in his letter of resignation: “Once again, we are seeing a genocide unfolding before our eyes and the Organization that we serve appears powerless to stop it. Why, in the face of daily footage and mounting evidence, is there such a callous denial, nay, persistent silencing and demonizing of those speaking out in Canada, the US, and Europe? What logic allows or enables pro-Israeli groups on and off UBC campus to label the calling for an end to the killing and the dismantling of the system of occupation and apartheid at its root as hate speech? Under current circumstances, denial is not a simple act of othering that we can debate in classrooms. It is a matter of life and death for millions of Palestinians. When “peace-loving” Canada and other pro-Israel regimes, including fascist governments in Europe, oppose or abstain during aGeneral assembly votecalling for a ceasefire, it is giving Israel a green light to continue the mass slaughter. If government policy is dictated by Machiavellian calculations of power, what is the excuse of academic institutions like UBC for failing to live up to their mandate of supporting efforts at decolonizing education? Why did UBC’s interim president choose to condemn the Hamas operation on October 7 but remain silent in the fact of Israel’s ongoing atrocities? Why are students rightly encouraged to speak out about decolonization and anti-racism in relation to other struggles but are faced with intimidation or silence in the case of Palestine? Why is it frowned upon to suggest a moral equivalence between oppressor and oppressed unless we are discussing Palestine? The answer lies in Palestinian exceptionalism. It is a sign of how entrenched the Zionist narrative remains in Canadian public perception and political power. The road to decolonize the discussion around Palestine is still rough and rugged. Those calling to decolonize Palestine are not even accorded a so-called balanced approach. When respected public figures like Ontario MPP Sarah Jama, a black woman activist for disabled rights, call for an end to occupation and Israeli apartheid,they are censuredby the Canadian mainstream left and right alike. Meanwhile, vile and hateful speech by Israel government officials and their Canadian allies depicting Palestinians as “human animals” goes unpunished. We must not be surprised at such an archaic language of racial supremacy. The inhumane logic of colonialism, which is still at work in the case of Palestine, has in the past operated in similar fashion elsewhere. As Martinique author Frantz Fanon told us more than half a century ago, the dehumanization of the colonized leads the colonizers to describe them using zoological terms. An important step on the road to decolonize the debate around Palestine at UBC — and elsewhere in Canada — is to confront the pernicious attack against pro-Palestinian voices under the false accusation of antisemitism. This accusation predates October 7 by decades. Its primary target has included non-violent activists calling for boycott, divestment and sanctions. According to its inverted logic, calling for an end to racial discrimination based on legalized ethno-religious supremacy and advocating for a single state for all its citizens is hate speech. The arsenal of hyperbolic and fear-mongering language used to hide the absurdity of this claim will not make it any less paradoxical or whitewash Israeli crimes. The apartheid emperor has no clothes, and it is incumbent on us to expose it without apology or hesitation. The unfortunate instrumentalization of antisemitism, such as the adoption of theflawed IHRAdefinition to shame and even criminalize those who oppose Israeli apartheid, has several connotations. It reflects the long-held Zionist ideology of conflating Zionism with Judaism. It also shows that Zionists have lost the argument and are scandalously using a discursive sledgehammer to demonize their opponents. It finally exposes the complicity of federal, provincial, and local governments in perpetuating anti-Palestinian prejudice. In the context of Palestine, zero tolerance for antisemitism must be coupled with zero tolerance for its instrumentalization to suppress Palestinian rights. That is the consistently humanistic position to take. More importantly, it is not incumbent on the colonized, the brutalized and the oppressed to constantly undergo a moral litmus test in the court of Western public opinion when this West’s moral pedestal lies at the lowest rung of Dante’s inferno. As historians know all too well, Global North states have a centuries-long history of horrific crimes against the peoples of the Global South and their own racialized populations. These crimes extend to every corner of this globe including the very land UBC is built on. The contemporary record of these states, as the people of Afghanistan, Yemen and Iraq know all too well, is no better. Since October 7, a new wave of McCarthyism has risen against pro-Palestinian voices across the “democratic” West. Many academics and evenphysiciansare feeling its reverberations in Canada. Rather than instil fear, it must embolden us to continue to speak truth to power until we are heard. This is especially true in a place of critical learning like the university. Public educators have a duty not to remain silent even at the risk of intensified suppression of the right to criticize Israel. In due course, history will absolve them the way it absolved their predecessors. The fact that more than 125 UBC faculty members and over 1000 students, staff and other community memberssigned a letterin response to the UBC president’s letter is a heartening sign in this regard. Students facing intimidation for supporting justice in Palestine also deserve faculty support and administrative protection from constant harassment and demonization. Students with opposed views might hopefully be encouraged to overcome their fears or prejudices and question some of their assumptions about the struggle for Palestinian liberation. Unlearning is the first step to learning. This cannot happen in a hostile climate. The history of colonization in Palestine did not begin on October 7. Understanding that history, which is part of the global history of colonization, as well as the rich precolonial history of co-existence, is a necessary step to making sense of the future. At present, the priority is to end the Israeli slaughter and large-scale destruction of Gaza by calling for a ceasefire, permitting the unconditional entry of humanitarian aid, restoring power, safeguarding hospitals, and eventually facilitating a prisoner’s exchange (Yes, there arethousands of Palestinian prisoners, including dozens of children, languishing in Israeli jails .

crimson_2023_73,"Before my classmates and I even set foot on campus as students, we had already received an impressive collection of school merchandise: a Harvard cap, a Harvard phone pocket, a Harvard t-shirt, a page of Harvard stickers. I was thrilled to finally be a part of this community, and I appreciated Harvard’s gesture. But this also marked the beginning of something far less exciting: a seemingly never-ending barrage of free merchandise that masks environmental damage and overconsumption under the guise of school spirit. There is nothing wrong with wanting to collect a few items of clothing and other accessories that represent one’s school. And at Harvard, students aren’t the only ones demanding loads of logo-filled accessories — as illustrated by the numerous gift shops around Harvard Square catering to tourists who want a material souvenir to bring back from their visit. Everything from sweatshirts and shot glasses to dog leashes and infant onesies, adorned with the Harvard name and crest, line the walls of shops throughout Massachusetts Avenue and John F. Kennedy Street. Perhaps, for tourists, merchandise sells because people like to have some sort of proof that they have been here or merely want to feel more in touch with a storied institution (after all, some of those onesies do read “Future Freshman” . But as Harvard students, our belonging to this community is not in question. We have no affiliation to prove, no need for souvenirs. Yet we continue to rely on excessive amounts of merchandise as some sort of manifestation of our belonging — to the College and to our houses, concentrations, and clubs. It’s time to reexamine our reliance on merchandise as a student body. I expect we’ll find that any intangible benefits pale in comparison to the very real costs. The creation of a single cotton t-shirt requires around 2,700 liters of water and produces nearly 15 pounds of carbon. That means that producing t-shirts for every undergraduate enrolled at the College ends up costing more than 19 million liters of water and 106,000 pounds of carbon. These numbers feel distant when students are faced with the offer of another free t-shirt, but they drive at the heart of the climate crisis, with the fashion industryfueling up to 10 percentof carbon emissions across the globe. One could argue that merchandise is a crucial way of showing the pride we take in our school —, of demonstrating our commitment to the College and our different communities within it. That is true, if we allow it to be. But we can also choose a different path — one that accepts limitations on the material goods we demand in order to help out our planet. Perhaps the first Class of 2025 t-shirt did make me feel closer to this community, more like an actual Harvard student. But can most of us say the same about every subsequent Harvard blanket, water bottle, freshman Yard t-shirt, House t-shirt, Harvard-Yale game sweater, and plastic Housing Day medal we may receive (to name just a few ? Our excessive consumption of free merchandise has offered me more climate anxiety than it has school spirit. It is particularly frustrating that one of the world’s leading research institutions, whose first and foremost role is to educate future generations, in some ways appears apathetic to that future. I feel no closer to Harvard by being in a sea of crimson-colored sweatshirts, and I feel no closer to my House by wearing a t-shirt featuring our (admittedly great polar bear mascot. At the end of the day, we can still be the loudest supporters at sports stadiums and the most united Houses on Housing Day without relying on merchandise to prove it. What binds our community together, rather, is the time we spend together, the activities that unite and inspire us, and our capacity to include and learn from each other. The most compassionate thing we can do to show support for ourselves, our classmates, and the future of our school is to take care of the earth that we live on. That would be a much stronger show of solidarity and mutual engagement than the performativity of identical t-shirts. And if Harvard is looking for ways to spend its $50.9 billion endowment, it might consider investing in our future through climate-positive action. School spirit is great — but so is the need to preserve the environment of the only planet we have. I’d be willing to trade in a few sweatshirts for the latter. Mie L.

crimson_2023_160,"I just finished my first year of college at Harvard. I would have been euphoric to learn this as a third grader, when my ambitions to attend a top college first sprung up. To me, college was the means to a high paying job, a stable career, and a contented life. It seems that many others would disagree with my naivety. Faith in our system of college education is falling. A recent study by the University of Chicago and The Wall Street Journal found that 56 percent of Americans feel that a four-year college degree isn’t worth it. High college tuitions, the competitiveness of obtaining a highly paying job, and long turnaround times for earning a degree may all be to blame. But I view this study a bit more optimistically. Americans may be losing faith in a traditional college education, but this says little about their faith in education as a whole. Instead, I believe this trend simply reflects an ongoing transition from formal education to novel forms of learning. College is the ultimate formal educational opportunity, and many of the fields its graduates pursue, including medicine, academia, and law, require even further formal education. Though colleges may look different from each other, the way they operate is similar: Students must acquire certain levels of subject mastery and use it to meet academic and credit benchmarks to succeed. However, there are many other avenues of acquiring this knowledge. The growth of open-access resources like Khan Academy has enabled educators to offer lessons that parallel ones you might find in an Ivy League classroom. Some popular Harvard classes, such as Stat110 and CS50, are in fact readily available on YouTube — some of them even with practice resources published online for the world to use. Thus, a motivated enough student could obtain a Harvard-level education without actually setting foot on campus! There is also something to be said about the distinction between education through action and education through theory. Harvard has some great exemplars among its dropouts: Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. They evidently decided the constraints of a traditional college education couldn’t support their ambitions. Action suited them better. So why waste time and exorbitant sums of money on seemingly futile college courses? Harvard’s liberal arts establishment might cringe at such a notion. Its goal is, of course, to develop a well-rounded understanding of the world we live in, “to navigate the world’s most complex issues, and address future innovations with unforeseen challenges.” But, is this perspective worth its roughly $80,000 per year price tag? This is where I might flip a coin. Heads: Clearly, this is where I land. I’m not sure what my career will look like, and I am reliant on a college education for inspiration. Along with studying subjects like biology, chemistry and literature formally, I have gained new skills (for example, I can mount an ant on a paper chad for imaging and intuitions that have fundamentally changed the way I think and view the world and my future in it. My college education is also not limited to a classroom. I learn just as much from working with clubs, having spirited debates with friends in dining halls and library foyers, and writing for The Crimson. These experiences can’t be found on Khan Academy. Tails: College may not be the best way to obtain specialized skill sets that some highly profitable and fulfilling careers require. Learning a trade, spending time honing coding skills, or dedicating one’s life to a sport are all careers for which a formal college education may be redundant and unnecessary. Realistically, the prestige of a Harvard education opens doors to many careers — though it’s hard to distinguish the role played by a person’s own skills and that of their degree. Yet having a degree at all seems to matter. Many employers still prefer hiring college graduates, and college graduates still earn more on average than their counterparts. However, as college remains inaccessible for many, educational institutions like Harvard must invest more resources into open-access educational tools, and we as a society must strengthen our system of K-12 education to set students up for successful careers right out of high school. A formal college education may not be the right option for everyone. This shouldn’t discourage us; it should remind us to consider the myriad of ways education can empower and uplift.

stanforddaily_2023_53,"Imagine it’s a sunny day at Stanford in 2018. You wake up and check your phone to see the latest FoHo newsletter drop in your email inbox — a Stanford medical studentpoisonedtheir classmates with formaldehyde?! At breakfast, you might pick up a copy of the Stanford Politics magazine in a dining hall and read its latestresponseto The Stanford Daily’s Editorial Board’sresponseto Stanford Politics’critiqueof The Daily. Not to mention the Stanford Sphere’s or the Stanford Review’scommentaryon the inter-newspaper drama. Today, only The Daily and the Review remain, leaving gaping holes in Stanford’s previously multifarious news media ecosystem. What happened to these publications, and what implications does their loss have on our community? The Fountain Hopper (or FoHo as it was more commonly known was an irreverent student-run tabloid whose anonymous newsletters were delivered directly to thousands of subscribers’ inboxes. It was the first publication tobreakthe Brock Turner story and delivered great continuing coverage on the case and itsaftermathat Stanford. FoHo also gained national attention for revealing how Stanford students could access theiradmissions files. Sadly, over COVID, its scoops dwindled, and today FoHo’s website no longer exists. FoHo occupied a unique place in our campus media landscape; without a high bar for fact-checking and sourcing, it could turn around breaking news before any facts were confirmed. These included stories about allegedcrimeson campus, alleged misconduct by Stanford administrators andfacultyand anecdotes about parties and student mischief. Although we don’t condone FoHo’s methods of uncovering and disseminating information, which revolved around anonymous and often unverified tips, we mourn the loss of such a widely-read media outlet. FoHo’s demise coincided with the rise of the social media app Fizz, an anonymous discussion forum app at Stanford and many other college campuses where anyone with a university email can post campus commentary, memes and odd requests. At first glance, it may seem like FoHo has beenreplacedby Fizz with its bulletin board-like discourse. However, Fizz lacks several defining features that lent FoHo its particular strength as a media outlet. Fizz is a free-for-all where any user can post any content without accountability. Without editors or writers who have a vested interest in maintaining and building the reputation of a breaking-news newsletter, Fizz seems to more closely resemble a campus-wide game of “telephone,” which can sometimes become a breeding ground for misinformation. In contrast, FoHo curated, chose and developed on the stories of most interest to the Stanford community to create its digests. FoHo is not the only student-run media outlet at Stanford that has ceased to exist. Most prominent among the rest wasStanford Politics, which was an invaluable source of high-quality, impactful investigations that sadly petered out in 2021. Their coverage was broad and unique in focus, ranging from an investigation intosorority lifeon campus to commentary on theLebanese governmentto think-pieces on Americancriminal justice reform. Stanford Politics pieces were thoughtful, well-sourced and held to high standards, fostering deepinvestigationsinto Stanford issues and providing a platform for political discourse ranging beyond Stanford’s campus. There was also theStanford Sphere, a lesser-read but still rigorous publication whose left-wing editorials balanced out theStanford Review’s conservative slant. The Review remains active and is today’s most prominent student publication after The Stanford Daily. Founded in 1987 by Peter Thiel and Norman Book, the Review’s primary output is op-eds, although it dabbles innews coverageandsatire. Although the Review does not have as long of a history as The Daily nor match its publishing volume, the two papers play a critical role in facilitating campus discourse. The coexistence of the Review’s and The Daily’s Opinions sections allows for more spacious commentary on campus events. For instance, the two outlets have offered unique critiques on Hoover’s institutionaldecisionsandpolicies. The Review also provides perspectives that lack on-campus representation, such as itscommentaryon last Spring’s Judge Duncancontroversy, where students continually interrupted a guest speaker. While none of The Daily’s writers opined about the issue, we applaud the Review’s timely position when other campus publications were quieter. We believe that the Reviewinjectsan integral dose of contrarianism into predominantly-liberal campus discourse — one that challenges students to question their existing beliefs and examine issues through a new lens. While we often differ from the conclusions and rhetoric of the Review, the Review’s contribution to the ideological diversity of Stanford’s media system deserves our recognition. Before COVID, the diversity of student-run media outlets dedicated to discovering stories created a healthy symbiotic relationship in our campus news ecosystem. FoHo curated the juiciest stories by parsing through hundreds of tips from on-the-ground sources, which The Daily would often investigate and publish with accurate facts and verifiable sources. Stanford Politics published long-term investigative projects and political commentary that went beyond the Stanford bubble. The Review and the Stanford Sphere filled out the spectrum of ideas and beliefs on campus, prompting open discourse and debate. This range of styles and competition for eyes kept more Stanford community members more informed, and constantly pushed publications to a higher standard of timeliness, engagement and impact. Without a range of options for all reading appetites, many Stanford students have simply turned to Fizz for their news and entertainment, where there is little to no authority, trusted sources, accountability, nor the ability to follow up on stories or make corrections in a uniform and transparent way. The Stanford Daily, the Stanford Review and even Fizz can only write, report, analyze and elicit so much. Our reach and perspectives are limited. New outlets, forming a more vibrant Stanford press environment, will provide more forums of empowerment for all to participate in campus conversations. We want to see more different publications independently going after the truth, so that as a community we obtain better facts faster and avoid bias. We want to read an array of well-developed, accountable opinions across the political spectrum. We want to see publications in conversation, holding each other accountable and achieving greater heights of student journalism through competition. Most of all, we want the whimsical, skeptical, curious spirit of Stanford to be enabled and elevated by our student-run publications, as they always have been. We look forward to seeing the ghosts of publications past resurrected – or replaced. The Stanford Daily Editorial Board comprises Opinions Editors, Columnists, and at least one member of the Stanford Community. The Board s views are reached through research, debate and individual expertise. The Board does not represent the views of the newsroom nor The Stanford Daily as a whole.

crimson_2023_24,"When I came to Harvard from India, I did so with the intention of studying the developing world. I understood the irony of going to the United States to learn how to contribute to South Asia, but when Harvard came calling it was very hard to refuse. I tried to make up for this cross-ocean selling out by filling my schedule with classes that assuaged my guilt: a history seminar on political independence and economic development in Africa, public policy and politics of the Middle East, and Indian Literature in Translation, a kind of lifeline to home. But all I received in many of my courses was a filtered, diluted, adulterated version of the Global South — the equivalent of watching a yellow-filter movie set in the slums of Dhaka or the saturated favelas of Rio. To blame Harvard alone for my dislocation, however, would be unjust. The international students Harvard admits are rarely the ones who can truly offer this institution the maximum amount of diversity. The kids at my school who applied to colleges abroad knew the U.S. intimately already. They watched American movies, listened to English music, and barely spoke their native languages — and I was no different. I did not grow up on the streets of Mumbai or shopping in Chandni-Chowk in Old Delhi but instead ate Domino’s pizza under the light of the skyscrapers of Bengaluru’s booming I.T. sector. Knowing that we would probably apply abroad from the moment we entered high school meant we shaped our lives to the standards of international colleges. We watched documentaries about the British forces at the Somme in our history classes, spent time on Reddit researching the PSAT and the SAT, looked at all the extracurricular activities that kids in America were doing and mimicked them. The pressure to look and act like other applicants, even in a system that supposedly encouraged individuality, persisted — because how were the admissions officers supposed to be able to understand our uniqueness if it was not couched in language and experiences they could understand with minimal effort? This ability to assimilate from afar is a privilege. It requires the resources and ability to engage with a completely different culture from one’s own. The students who can do this are already removed from the vast majority of their country’s population, and therefore their culture and way of life. Harvard misses swaths of talented students from around the world because those students believe they would never be able to get in, and thus don’t even apply. This generalization is obviously not true of every student and every country, but is definitely a clear trend in the international student body, particularly from the developing world. Close your eyes and imagine the average Indian. Whether inspired by Slumdog Millionaire or riding a cow, that person looks a lot more like the median Indian — even the median urban Indian — than any of the students I know from India who were accepted to the College Class of 2026. But when we come here, we are asked to speak for our country. I have never felt more Indian than when I have been here, alone, and faced with incessant questions from other students about my home country. And at the same time, I have never felt more Americanized, learning how to view my home through the eyes of neoliberal economics and modernization theory. All our lives, many of us felt like we lived with one foot in each world, never really global citizens but never really children of our country’s soil. Going to an institution like Harvard pulls us further away from a home we are already hesitant to call our own. Perhaps, then, what I should aim for is not to be acted upon by Harvard but to act upon it. If I don’t make the active effort to find the classes that focus on what I want to learn, can I really complain about Economics 10b: “Principles of Economics” slides that contrast suited Americans smiling at the camera with Indians fixing a bullock cart? Harvard does not make this easy. In many courses, the non-U.S. is usually only important as a counterpoint, a mirror to our real focus. At best, these classes will devote a slide to the Global not-West every few sessions, a single lecture in a semester, sometimes even just a footnote in a reading. But what Harvard will always have is opportunities, resources, information — if I go that bit further and look for them. It will have rooms full of census data from the developing world, hiding under Lamont. Centers devoted to studying parts of the Global South shelved above coffee shops in the Square. Indian poet A.K. Ramanujan once said that tradition is not a birthright, but that it has to be “earned and repossessed.” Perhaps coming to Harvard can be my opportunity to discover it, reimagine it, and begin to live it.

stanforddaily_2023_28,"Hello, My name is Jasmin Palmer. I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the mechanical engineering department. I live in EVGR B, where I have a clear view of the EVGR B/C courtyard (if you excuse the windows that have not been cleaned in two plus years . Like many graduate students, I am appalled by Stanford’s lack of action concerning affordability. I have attached a picture I took from my apartment of students lined up for the food pantry. Every time the food pantry occurs I feel the line gets longer as a result of how unsustainably expensive it has become to be a graduate student-employee of Stanford. Though I appreciate that the food pantry is an option for students in need, I can’t help but feel disgusted that it is needed at all at an institution that possesses more wealth and resources than most of us can imagine and then still has the gall to increase tuition for its students who are clearly not seeing that benefit pass down. I hope that some administrator sees these images and that it inspires them to actually act on Stanford’s supposed interest in prioritizing student well-being. Because as our employer and landlord, setting wages and housing prices such that an increasing number of students need food assistance is certainly not doing that."
rice_thresher_2023_50,"ByBen Baker-KatzandMorgan Gage3/21/23 9:19pm Several changes were introduced to Beer Bike this year, largely at the urging of administrators, in hopes of a smoother, safer race. While we don’t strongly disagree with any of the changes that were implemented, the process illustrates a broader push to strip away the traditions that make RiceRice. A few weeks ago, members of pit crews across campus were asked to sign a contract stating they acknowledge Rice Program Council’s right to remove them from the track should they blow an 0.02 BAC on a race-day breathalyzer test, never mind the fact that it is legal to operate a 4000 pound motor vehicle with a BAC four times higher. Though the final BAC limit for pit crew has yet to be finalized, administrators also considered, but did not implement, requiring chuggers to be breathalyzed alongside bikers and pit crew. Necessary safety precautions are just that, but overzealous precautions endanger campus traditions. Continuing to discourage students with any level of alcohol in their system from participating in events will simply lead to those events’ decay. Forcing all students, not just bikers, to choose between the Beer Bike races and the Beer Bike experience is a waste of time and energy that comes at the expense of campus traditions. While we embrace students shedding the traditions that no longer suit the campus community and forging new ones in their place, that is different than admin-imposed restrictions which lead to the slow dulling of traditions’ shine and their eventual deaths. Will we even hear Beer Bike croak in 20 years? Not to lecture about itagain, but the very idea of public parties being public has withered. Since public parties returned after a COVID-19 hiatus, students compete for a spot in the line of a Google form — instead of having truly public parties with natural capacity limits — since ticketing and wristband requirements have been imposed. With no remaining COVID restrictions on campus, the impetus for selling wristbands has disappeared. Now all we have is 18-year-olds reselling free wristbands for a profit. These traditions were all reduced from their former glory in service of an administrative desire for “safety.” We don’t mean to minimize safety concerns. We’ve called forincreased responsibilitywhen drinking from our editors’ desk before. But decades of Rice students have made it through drinking, biking and college parties relatively fine, and when something goes wrong? We’re adults. That’s on us. But Beer Bike, with or without alcohol, is an inherently unsafe event. Bikers whipping around the track at high speeds is a recipe for disaster every year. The waivers all students on the track are required to sign is acknowledgment of that. Though less severe, the same holds true for public parties and a host of other college traditions, at Rice and beyond. As long as there will never be a perfectly safe Beer Bike, which there never will be, campus is forced to make trade-offs between safety and tradition. Recently, we think campus has leaned too hard toward performative precautions at the expense of preserving those traditions. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2023_90,"This is the second article in the Editorial Board’s three-part series on revitalizing Stanford student life. This piece focuses on how the Stanford community — students, alumni, faculty, governance and administration — can work towards a more accountable future. At long last, it appears the wind of change is blowing on Stanford’s campus. After adisastrous year for Stanford’s reputationand amid a brewing storm of student, alumni, and faculty discontent, there are signs that the University may be changing course. The Provost has unexpectedlyresigned. The President may beunlikely to survive. And the newly elected ASSU Executives promise areturn of funto revive Stanford’s ailing student life. As much as these changes in leadership are welcome, they risk being a temporary reprieve. Only when true accountability reaches across the entire Stanford administration — from middle management to those delivering front-line student services — can we fix the lasting damage to the university and students’ experiences and well-being. To achieve this, Stanford stakeholders need to act collectively to hold administrators at all levels responsible to the community they serve. First, we must take stock of the toll that Stanford’s unchecked administrative growth has taken on student life and consequently the university’s standing. The viralPalladium articleandour previous editorialhave detailed how the Stanford administration’s relentless campaign to absolve itself from liability has decimated student life and made campus less safe. But the problem of administrative malfeasance extends far beyond destroying the“esoteric whimsical nature”of Stanford culture. From student groupsstruggling for fundingwhile beingtightly controlled by administrators, to international students despairing if they’llreceive visa assistancein time so they can stay in the country, to the anxious wait forfinancial aid support, to hungry students resorting tofood bankssince groceries on campus areextortionate, to stillnot having enough counselorsto address the mental health crisis on campus, Stanford student services are unfit for an institution claiming to be among the best in the world. Instead of learning and developing, students find their Stanford experiences and communities wracked by inadequate services and excessive bureaucracy. The rampant expansion in administration and regulation is actively hurting Stanford’s strategic interests. When students spend their days fighting administrative battles, they become reluctant to advocate for, or eventually donate to, an institution that seems to only want toexpand the number of staff and administrators— currently17,000strong — who were in many cases detrimental to their experience. When it becomes harder to convince the very brightest that Stanford is the place where they’ll thrive — when current students themselves have no confidence in the university’s leadership — it hurts the well-being of the Stanford body and Stanford’s standing relative to its peers. The ongoing disillusionment of students burdened by administrative incompetence and overreach threatens tospill into the public sphere. The fundamental problem isa lack of accountabilityfor administrators. This has been driven by a loss of institutional knowledge and connections between students, alumni, faculty, and university governance from the pandemic that has made it harder to collectively organize. Administrators have had free rein to push throughunpopular policiesand expandregulationsthat prioritize reducing liability over enhancing opportunity. When challenged, administrators set up “task forces,” “accelerators” and “working groups”that delayand distract from action. Often, offices dealing with students eagerly shift responsibility onto another part of Stanford’s labyrinthine network of administrators (the Office of the General Counsel and“Risk Management”are classic favorites which makes it impossible to pin down who exactly can solve problems. If all else fails, they simply wait students out until we are exhausted or graduated.Students feel powerless. We currently do not have the resources to resist, so individual administrators can act with impunity since there is no direct accountability or transparent feedback from those they serve. “Administration” can be a nebulous concept.To strike back, members of the Stanford community need to understand how Stanford operates and consequently what specific levers of power we can pull to bring about change. The key isincreasing transparency and collective action. A revolutionary step would be to implement a feedback system for administrative services in a manner similar toCarta, where students anonymously share their evaluations of teaching staff. If student feedback ratings were tied to administrators’ performance reviews, this could massively drive up standards. And as recent leadershipchangesshow, the Stanford community expressing its collective views can advance the university. This radically new system is unlikely to be adopted by the University (we would love to be proven wrong , but in its absence, how can stakeholders act to protect their interests and guide Stanford towards a better future? Students, Alumni, and theASSU Faculty, Governance and Administration An alum recently remarked to an Editorial Board member that “Stanford today has become like the government — but worse.” As a society, we have learned that it requires transparency and accountability to ensure that those in positions of power serve their constituents. While administrators may not yet be formally accountable to the student body they serve, as members of the Stanford community we have both the responsibility and ability to keep the university on the right track. Through increasing collective action and doing our part to hold the university administration to account, we can ensure that Stanford’s winds of freedom continue to blow.

state_press_2023_24,"ASU men s basketball head coach Bobby Hurley calling a play at the University of Dayton Arena on Wednesday, March 15, 2023. ASU beat Nevada 98-73. Bobby Hurley s tenure as ASU men s basketball coach was in question weeks ago. After starting 15-3, the team dropped nine of its last 13 games to finish the regular season 20-11. Only a desperatehalf-court heaveby Desmond Cambridge Jr. to beat Arizona in Tuscon kept the team s NCAA Tournament hopes alive, and a solid conference tournament run ended up being enough to get the team into March Madness. We could say what if all we want about Cambridge Jr. s game-winner orASU s conference tournament run. However, the fact is that ASU made the NCAA Tournament, won a game and nearly won a second. They also beat Arizona in Tucson, a feat not accomplished since 2019. If a Sun Devil fan were told that was how the season would go before the season started, it s highly unlikely they would be doing anything more than asking for an extension of Hurley s time at ASU. Luckily, that s exactly what happened, as Hurley s contract has been extended through the 2025-2026 men s college basketball season. READ MORE:ASU extends basketball coach Bobby Hurley s contract through 2026 That s not to say, of course, that Hurley s 2022-2023 season was all roses. The middle-of-the-season collapse before the trip to Tucson was a horrific blemish on what was, at one point, a historically excellent season. One could argue that barely making it into the tournament with the talent the team had was a disappointment in itself. Yet, the heights that the team reached are much more important than the lows that Hurley saw during this past season. Over his tenure, Hurley has taken the Sun Devils to the NCAA Tournament a total of three times. In the seasons when the team didn t make the NCAA tournament, its win-loss percentage was at least close to .500 and they may have made the NCAA tournament in the 2019-2020 season if not for the tournament being canceled. That is a track record of success. It s not excellence, perfection or close to the loftiest of standards for Sun Devil fans, but it s still success. Importantly, Hurley isn t just a good coach; he s a good person. Michael Randle, an ASU basketball fan, went to the ASU versus Arizona men s basketball game in Tucson, the game where Cambridge Jr. hit the half-court shot. At the game, Randle said he was called racial slurs by a fan who was upset with the ASU gear Randle was wearing. After the game, Randle received a call. Coach Hurley was one of those people that called me and apologized for me having gone through that, Randle said. I don t care about what other people say about Coach Hurley, I love the man as a human being. Hurley is also loved by his players. After the team sNCAA Tournament loss to TCU, Cambridge Jr. tweeted out his feelings and showed his support for Hurley, tweeting #TeamBobbyHurley. Unfortunately, Hurley s team next season is going to look much different. At the least, Cambridge Jr. and Luther Muhammad will not be returning to the team, as both have exhausted their playing eligibility. Devan Cambridge, Warren Washington and Alonzo Gaffney are seniors but still have remaining eligibility. Those players were the heart of this Sun Devil team. That doesn t mean Hurley won t have talent to work with. Even if those players leave, guys such as Frankie Collins, Jamiya Neal, Austin Nunez and DJ Horne hold promise. Slight regression next season should be expected, but ASU fans should remember this past season as a sign of how things can be for ASU men s basketball when key players have time and experience. Hurley has proven himself to be able to succeed, and now he has time to take the squad to the next level. Whether or not letting Hurley go after his new extension would be a good decision remains to be seen, but Sun Devil fans need to remember that the grass isn t always greener on the other side. For now, they should applaud the 2022-2023 team and its accomplishments, and then lend support to a team that could be on the way to new heights for a program that hasn t reached its highest potential.

rice_thresher_2023_46,"ByLuke Han4/11/23 11:58pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. As a large and diverse community, Rice University offers numerous opportunities for students to socialize and have fun outside the classroom. Some of the more notable events are the student-run public parties. However, in recent years, there has been a trend and movement to push for increased safety at such social events. While I acknowledge that maintaining tradition is important, it is time for Rice University to take more proactive approaches to ensure the safety of its students at social events such as publics. At public parties, security should be a top priority. Unfortunately, recent incidents have highlighted the failures of current security measures. The combination of alcohol, a tight-knit community and tickets creates a challenging environment for security at publics. While the ticketing measures were implemented with goals of limiting capacity at publics, the actual execution of the ticketing program has created rifts between students and the volunteers running such social events. Having attended the majority of publics and volunteered for the Wiess College and Martel College publics, it’s clear that security volunteers, college socials and coordinators struggle with enforcing the security rules that protect attendees. As an example, at the Martel public, there were large groups of students let in through the side doors by a security volunteer. The group then proceeded to sneak up into the Martel sundeck with assistance by the same security volunteer. On that same morning, it was communicated to security volunteers that a large group of Lovetteers on the third floor forced their way through RUPD officers and security volunteers onto the sundeck. Besides the fact that such actions are unfair to the students that legitimately got tickets, such failures by volunteers in security roles present a great and life-threatening danger to students. If security student volunteers are to continue, there is a need for them to be bold, loud and courageous in challenging people. As an example, the most outrageous violation I ever witnessed working security was with two students and the same volunteer that opened the side doors at Martel to allow groups to enter. The two students and volunteer, working together to take a filled water cooler from the first floor, snuck past the RUPD officer and Martel coordinator, spilling water all over the stairs while doing so. The consequences of failures in access control should not occur; students should be proactive in safety and maintaining a secure environment to protect the Rice population from hostile forces. One possible solution to this issue is to increase the presence of security personnel at these events. Rice University should consider hiring more security guards or partnering with local law enforcement to ensure that these parties are properly staffed. While Rice currently has its police force at publics, they are underutilized as students continue to break through security. There is a need for Rice to bolster its police presence by hiring more RUPD officers or bringing in additional Houston Police Department officers and Harris County constables to protect students at Rice publics. Furthermore, deterrents to would-be troublemakers should be considered, including drug and bomb sniffing dogs along with searches of event attendees. In addition to being deterrents, such initiatives would also give students peace of mind knowing that there are trained professionals on hand to protect them from the many dangers present at publics. While some may contend that such measures will choke many campus traditions to the point of elimination, it is important to note that historically, traditions have successfully been adjusted for safety without sacrificing the meaning of the traditions. For instance, the spirit of Beer Bike today continues despite the elimination of beer from the chugging component of the race, with no sacrifices to the energy and festivities associated with Rice’s most iconic tradition. And at Texas A&M, the Aggie Bonfire since the 1999 collapse has been modified to be much smaller, yet safer than its predecessors, showing that traditions can be maintained without sacrificing safety. Rice University must continue their proactive approach to ensure the safety of its students at public parties. While such measures may weaken existing traditions or seem inconvenient, such sacrifices must be made to ensure the safety of every single student, no matter the hazard. These measures are a necessary step to ensure that students can have fun and socialize in a safe and secure environment. By prioritizing the safety of its students, Rice University can foster a stronger sense of community and create a more vibrant campus culture. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.

stanforddaily_2023_86,"The old guy in the classroom may not look like a typical Stanford student, but he is living the dream the rest of those in the room are lucky enough to share. I started as a fellow in Stanford’s year-long Distinguished Careers Institute (DCI program last September and I have loved every minute of my time here. DCI wascreatedin 2015 by Dr. Phil Pizzo, the former Dean of the Stanford School of Medicine (now in his late 70s, and a former Catholic who converted to Judaism and is currentlystudyingto become a rabbi, demonstrating vividly to all of us that learning has no age limits . Our cohort consists of about 30 each year, a few of whom bring their partners to participate in the program. We are happily welcomed in most classes across the University — I have taken courses in history, law, medicine, psychology, writing, ethics and more. I have had the privilege of absorbing wisdom from historian David Kennedy, psychologist and longevity expert Laura Carstensen, ethicist Rob Reich and neuroscientist David Eagleman, but also lesser known but significant talents such as poet and memoir teacher John Evans, visiting family law instructor Joanna Grossman and many others. And we are fortunate to have a new “faculty dialogue” every Wednesday with Stanford professors we might not otherwise have the opportunity to get to know. DCIbuildsits program on three pillars: community, purpose and wellness. But for me, and I believe for most of us, what emerges during the year as the most profound and meaningful experience is community, both within our cohort and throughout Stanford. We come from a wide range of backgrounds (mine was film, television and journalism and locations. My cohort has three Brazilians, one Venezuelan, two from the UK, one from China and of course many from all over the US (including one from New Jersey, myself . The alchemy somehow works brilliantly. Do we all love each other? Perhaps not. But I am confident in saying we all get along, engage in frequent conversations, socialize and, above all, help each other in ways I did not think were possible. When one of the members of our cohort was hit by a car while riding his bicycle early in the year, the cohort was there for him and his family, providing food, care and emotional support. People are frequently offering the use of their homes to other fellows (and their families . And the exchange of introductions, and dare I say, wisdom, among fellows has been ongoing and without the need for any quid pro quo. Graciousness and generosity are manifest on a regular basis in the program among people who didn’t know each other at all and now are willing, indeed eager, to go the extra mile for one another. At the core of DCI is something called the Life Transformation Reflection, or LTR. We are not required to do it, but nearly everyone does. The LTR is a 20 minute “presentation” by each fellow, and happens on Wednesdays. The fellow chooses what they want to talk about. There are neither requirements nor limitations (beyond a general appreciation for civility . They can be and have been funny and lighthearted. But many have been stunningly personal and revealing, and have brought many of us to tears. It is a tribute to the program and its creators that the LTR is a place where people of considerable achievement feel comfortable to share in many cases stories they admit they have never shared with anyone outside their partners — and in some cases not even that. Then there is the incredibly important intergenerational piece of our experience. I’m the oldest member of our cohort. There. I said it. I have a granddaughter who is nearly old enough to be a Stanford freshman. I love being a part of a great university with so many energetic, motivated, gifted young people pursuing so many different pathways, many of whom I have met in the classroom, at panels and events with Knight-Hennessy Scholars, at MSx (Masters in Management mixers, in undergraduate courses and through random interactions that have enhanced my experience here — and perhaps even theirs a bit. I’ve gone to dozens of sporting events here, attended many lectures and other events outside of the classroom, explored the campus and beyond, yet only scratched the surface of what this place has to offer. I don’t know what they think of me, but I have interacted with many students, and they have been wonderful, and I wish and hope I am around long enough to know what they accomplish in coming years. September to August isn’t enough time. I am on campus most days from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. Not long enough. That old guy in the classroom knows how lucky he is to be here, and he is grateful to the Stanford community for being so welcoming.

state_press_2023_4,"ASU Students frustrated over an online assignment in the Noble Library in Tempe on Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2023. ASU Online is the campus everyone forgets about, and it shows. Online students have to deal with accelerated courses and large class sizes which makes keeping up even harder than for traditional in-person students. ASU should address this gap and make sure that online students also have a high-quality education. Unlike in-person classes, the majority of ASU Online courses areaccelerated, meaning their time frame is about seven and a half weeks instead of the regular 15 weeks for most in-person classes. ASU Online students also reported their classes typically being on the larger end, which makes it difficult to connect with one another. Because of this, ASU should offer more semester-length courses and have smaller class sizes to aid with more personalized learning. An ASU spokesperson did not respond in time to requests for comment. Cass Dent, an ASU Online sophomore studying political science, said that this speedy format makes it harder to learn. “(Accelerated courses make it hard to have time to fully grasp the concepts before you re moving on to the next thing,” Dent said. “The classes are just very fast-paced.” Another issue with learning virtually is that it is not as engaging as learning face-to-face. According to a study by theNational Library of Medicine, face-to-face learning causes most people to feel more engaged with the content and are able retain it more easily. Johanna Scarlata, an ASU Online freshman studying English, prefers learning in person for this reason. “I was more engaged (in person . Online I’m just focused on getting things done and moving on to the next thing,” Scarlata said. “I m still learning, but it s not staying in my brain as it (did when I went to school in person.” The rapid-paced courses do not do much to offset this learning loss. Rather than genuinely learning the content, Dent said she feels that she is only cramming the information. “When you cram for a test, and you‘re like, ‘I need to take this test and get an A’, but it doesn’t matter how much I retain after,” Dent said. “It feels like a constant state of just cramming for the next quiz.” Another issue with learning online is the struggle to have a connection with others and get that extra support. Luz María Hernández Chaparro, an ASU Online freshman studying physics, finds being an online student an isolating experience. “I do feel alone because there s no one my age in my house,” Hernández Chaparro said. “I have no classmates that are sitting right next to me that I can (ask to clarify a question that I have.” Not being able to have those connections with fellow students and professors that in-person students have causes generalloneliness and isolationamong online students. Smaller class sizes and more engagement would be helpful because getting that personalized learning would close the gap between students and professors. It would help students to get to know each other. However, ASU Online professors themselves are flexible and accommodating which does help lessen the load. “If I emailed them, they’ll be there right away,” Hernández Chaparro said. Some professors provide extensive help to make sure each student knows what they should be doing. “I had a professor who, when I submitted an essay for my English class, made a five-minute full-length video just for me and for each student and posted it on YouTube, analyzing the paper step-by-step, and telling you what you need to fix specifically,” Scarlata said. Although not all professors are the same, the majority of them do what they can to help students thrive in their courses. But their efforts alone are not enough to help students be engaged. The problem lies within the structure of ASU Online courses rather than the professors individually. For that, ASU needs to rethink the way online courses function, so online students do not have to struggle as much to get their education.

state_press_2023_32,"Despite Tempe City Council s efforts to curb the craving of vaping, they need to do more to stop ASU students and other young adults in Arizona from partaking in the habit. On Feb. 2, Tempe City Council released a new plan to enact tobacco sales licenses to address youth vaping and tobacco use. This replaced its old plan: banning flavored tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes. Though I agree with the spirit of this policy, the approach is flawed because it fails to target the most important demographic: the youth. Arizona isone of 10 stateswithout a statewide tobacco licensing registry. Alicensing registryis meant to hold sellers to account with the threat of losing their licenses to sell if they break tobacco laws. However, cities, such as Tucson and Flagstaff, have implemented tobacco sales license registries on a local level through ordinances, similar to what Tempe City Council is proposing. We ve heard from school boards, parents and health advocates saying that something needs to be done about vaping and tobacco use by our kids, Councilmember Doreen Garlid said in a committee meeting regarding the plan. As councilmembers, it s our responsibility to look out for the health and safety of our youth. We will continue to work to make sure that these dangerous and addictive products stay out of the hands of kids and teens. I absolutely agree with the sentiment of combating youth vaping. What I disagree with, however, is how the City Council is getting its ideas. Garlid said it herself: the council has listened to school boards, parents and health advocates. But in my eyes, the elephant in the room is the group the council hasn t listened to; the group that it is trying to target with this proposal. I don t think that unless you see the problem firsthand you can actually truly understand it, said Joe Beining, a freshman studying political science and psychology at the Tempe campus. (If you try to act like you re the voices of the people who see this stuff, it s not gonna do anything. If you re going to effectively create policy to address a problem, you should focus on taking ideas from the group most affected bythat problem. In this case, that would be the youth. I don t think we were ever really taught a whole ton about vaping, Beining said. There was a lot of stuff about alcoholism and drugs but for whatever reason, vaping seemed to get kind of swept under the rug. I, too, think that the best solutions to the vaping crisis stem from education. In my own experience, I was not taught much in regard to vaping or thelong-term health effectsexperienced by its users. Sure, implementing a tobacco licensing registry isn t a bad idea, but to put it in Beining s words, you know a guy who knows a guy who s gonna sell to you. A tobacco licensing registry can t prevent an of-age person from buying vape and tobacco products for someone underage, but education on the subject can prevent an underage person from having someone buy for them in the first place. READ MORE:Tempe City Council pivots to restrictions instead of bans on vape and tobacco Dylan Seeman, a sophomore studying art at the Downtown Phoenix campus, started smoking when he was 13 years old. Currently, he is trying to quit. He thinks that education would have put him off of his habit before he started. The biggest problem is not realizing that these (cigarettes and vapes have consequences, he said. I think if you took me when I was a little kid and you showed me someone in a hospital and they were gasping for air and you re like oh, that can be me, that’s a much bigger educational impact than telling me something s bad. Simply telling kids that something is bad for them down the road won t make them understand the true harms and risks of it. You have to show them those consequences for them to truly register. This has been my biggest regret in life and all because I saw 50s movies and I thought it was cool, Seeman said. I thought man I really wanna be like that guy, that guy is cool! No, you don t. It actually just chains you and now I lose $300 a month. So perhaps, instead of justattacking the issue of youth vaping at the point of sale, I d say the City Council should also be focusing on the educational aspect of the issue. If you want true change and a real reduction in youth vaping, you need to focus on telling kids whythey shouldn t vape, instead of just restricting their means to vape in the first place. Tempe City Council has its heart in the right place, but the proposed plan doesn t fully recognize the reality of the situation. Should the council want its approach to match reality, it needs to talk to the youth it aims to help. Edited by Kate Duffy, Reagan Priest, Greta Forslund and Anusha Natarajan.

thetech_mit_2023_2,"We, a collective of graduate students in the MIT Doctoral Program in History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society (HASTS , forcefully condemn the recent actions of the MIT administration toward members of our campus community speaking out against the violent oppression of Palestinian people and genocide being enacted in Gaza by the Israeli state, which has received military and financial backing from the United States. We stand in solidarity with student groups across campus—includingMIT Jews for Ceasefire, theArab Student Organization, theBlack Graduate Student Association, theBlack Students’ Union, theAsian American Initiative, and the broaderMIT Coalition for Palestine—in calling for the liberation of Palestine and an end to more than 75 years of Israeli settler-occupation, towards a land with freedom and equal rights for all. We grieve all lives lost and fiercely oppose all forms of Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, and racist violence. We are extremely concerned that the Institute chose to deploy armed campus police tocancel apeaceful teach-inon Friday, November 10, 2023, quashing dissent through fear-based tactics that have infamous historical precedentsat MITandin the USmore broadly. We are especially alarmed by the Institute’s threat to suspend students—even if only from non-academic activities—who had participated in a sit-in on Thursday, November 9. While MIT justified this disciplinary action by claiming that demonstrators were acting against Institute guidelines by organizing a demonstration in an unapproved location,the guidelinechanging Lobby 7 from a preferred location to a by-approval-only one was introducedafterthe sit-in had already been organized and announced,raising questions about its timing and purpose. We see this as a contradiction toMIT’s stated commitmentto academic freedom and freedom of expression. Our concerns are heightened amidst risingcensorship on US university campusesabout Palestinian human rights, which scholars have termed the “Palestine exception”to free speech. Actively preventing students and researchers from speaking openly about historical events and their ongoing implications is not only a moral and ethical failure—it also flies in the face of MIT’s commitment to the pursuit of knowledge based on empirical evidence. It is disturbing that Institute administrators chose to punish students who are standing against a “mass ethnic cleansing,” in the words of the UN Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories. We are worried that the Institute’s current approach—including theexpansion of police presenceon campus—impedes campus safety for all students, especially those from already marginalized groups, and degrades the Institute as a space of learning and empowerment. We applaud student protesters for addressing the uncomfortable and complicated ways that MIT abets global violence and militarism. As historians and anthropologists of science and technology, we too feel driven to identify and challenge how MIT programs aid and benefit from settler-occupation, militarization, and genocide, both past and present. MIT’s active participation in the violent projects ofAmerican slaveryandsettler-colonialismhas been well-documented, and its alignment with US policy support for the Israeli government and military continues this legacy. MIT is also imbricated in the violence through its own research ties: theMIT-Israel Lockheed Martin Seed Fund, for instance, openly fosters the MIT community’s involvement with Lockheed Martin facilities in Israel that conduct research in potential service to the development of military and carceral technologies. While we acknowledge the complicity of our respective academic disciplines in global projects of colonial and imperial oppression, we also staunchly believe in their ability to contribute to our ongoing scholarly commitments to feminist, anti-colonial, and anti-oppressive research. We amplifythe voices of scholarsin our fields who are speaking up. We draw inspiration from the long history of the MIT community’s opposition against the Institute’s complicity in global injustices, ranging from theVietnam Wartoapartheid in South Africa. We urge MIT to opposeapartheidin Israel and call out the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians by severing its academic, financial, and political partnerships with entities that facilitate this violence, including the Lockheed Martin Seed Fund. We are optimistic that institutional change is possible given the precedents set by such student movements of the past. In 1969, for example, MIT students and faculty held ananti-war research strike, successfully forcing MIT toofficially divestfrom the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory (now Draper Laboratories . Informed by this history, we believe in MIT s power to create meaningful change, in both the local and international spheres. We ask the MIT administration to support all students whose safety and well-being are adversely impacted by the decades-long violence in Israel and Palestine and who are expressing their views on campus. To ensure this, our requests are as follows: We urge that peaceful demonstrations be allowed on campus, including by groups that were unfairly threatened with suspension from non-academic activities for the non-violent sit-in on November 9. The way we see it, the goal of a demonstrationisto disrupt, to acknowledge that business should not go on as usual. Even so, the demonstration for which protestors were punisheddid not prevent any students from going to class nor cause significant disruption. We demand that MIT conduct open and thorough investigations ofongoing harassment,intimidation and doxxingfaced by students supporting Palestinian human rights, faced by students supporting Palestinian human rights, and to take concrete measures ensuring that all students are protected from such harassment. This includes ensuring that protesters are not filmed against their consent with the goal of intimidation and doxxing as occurred at the sit-in on November 9. We ask the Institute to be transparent about its Ad Hoc Complaint Response Team, including communicating to the community: what behavior constitutes harassment; where and how it can be reported; how complaints will be reviewed; what the disciplinary consequences are for specific harassing actions; and where further support and resources can be found at MIT. We ask that the proposed councilStanding Together Against Hateclearly distinguish between anti-Semitism and Islamophobia on the one hand, and the protest of states and state policies on the other, asMIT Jews for Ceasefire has also demanded. We ask that the administration and its various offices make clear what students’ legal and institutional rights are in demonstrating on and off campus, and how to seek protection if needed. We echo thedemands made by facultyfor clarity about disciplinary decision-making processes and students’ right to due process. We ask that the Institute allocate financial and human resources to existing departments, centers, and programs that are best suited to provide educational programming on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially through the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS . The History department already offers courses that explore MIT’s historical and ongoing involvement in systemic inequality and oppression, such asMIT and SlaveryandThe Indigenous History of MIT. We ask MIT to similarly invest in educational programming about MIT’s ties to militarism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by, for instance, developing a course on MIT and Defense Funding/Research. Above all, we ask that MIT be an institution true to itsvaluesas a place where rights to freedom of expression are upheld, and where commitments toward making a better world are driven by the desire for human flourishing—not the interests of donors, the net gain of financial holdings, or US foreign policy agendas. Until that time arrives, we join our voices to those of our campus colleagues to demand that MIT stop repressing members of the community who are bravely giving their time and energy to advocate for an end to the violence in occupied Palestine. An institution of MIT’s caliber deserves better leadership. This statement was collectively authored and/or endorsed by a group of 20 doctoral students in History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society (HASTS at MIT, a program committed to the interdisciplinary study of the social, cultural, and political life of science and technology. It represents our own views, not those of all individuals in the program nor those of the program itself. Traditionally, The Tech requests that opinion pieces carry the names of the authors to ensure credibility and accountability for the content. However, in light ofdoxxing incidents faced by students at other universities, we have chosen to not include the names of the individual students whose views are represented here. -Srinidhi Narayanan, Editor-in-Chief"
rice_thresher_2023_11,"ByClaire Druffner11/14/23 10:41pm Editor’s Note: This story contains explicit descriptions of abortion. This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Last semester at West Servery, I found my flyer, “Pro-life after Roe: Catholic Answers to FAQ’s,” vandalized. “FORCED BIRTH” was scrawled over “Pro-life” in big block letters. I was disappointed; these flyers were meant to engage the Rice community in healthy conversation. “Pro-Life after Roe,” like all of the talks hosted by the Catholic Student Association, provided the Catholic Christian perspective on various topics and a space for healthy conversation. With these talks, I want people to dialogue with teachings founded in truth, mercy and love. One such teaching is that every person has inherent, immutable dignity. Human life is sacred from the moment of conception until natural death. 96%percent of self-selecting biologists, of which 85% identify as pro-choice, affirm that human life begins at fertilization, according to a survey conducted as part of the 2022 Supreme Court caseDobbs v. Jackson. The Church upholds this living fetus as a humanpersonin its mission to protect all persons — the immigrant, the elderly, the disabled, the convicted, the homeless, the trafficked, the unborn, the single mother: all forgotten in our “eat or be eaten” society. In contrast, the pro-choice movement prioritizes the choice of the mother over the life of the fetus; the pro-life movement values both the life of mother and child. In addition to the Church’s position on personhood, “Pro-Life After Roe” discussed questions like, what about cases when the life of the mother is threatened by pregnancy? For legal, medical and moral purposes,the Church, the pro-life movementand the currentlaw underDobbsdefine abortion as the intentional killing of a fetus. In some medical terminology, an abortion can also refer to a miscarriage or procedure that saves the life of the mother like the removal of an ectopic pregnancy. I find it necessary to make this distinction to prevent confusion: Theintentionandactionof an abortion are distinct because an abortion acts on a fetus to destroy it inside the uterus, whereas a miscarriage and life-saving medical care do not. Ina medical abortion, conducted up to nine weeks of pregnancy, the patient swallows two pills: first, mifepristone cuts off the fetus’ access to nutrients by ending implantation. Then, misoprostol induces labor of the dead fetus.In a surgical abortion, first trimester abortions are normally performed with a suction device that pulls apart the fetus and vacuums out their parts. In asecond trimester abortion, medicine may be injected to induce a fetal heart attack. Then, forcepsdismemberthe fetus. Finally, a suction device and sharp curette clears out the remaining fetal parts. In cases of removing a fetus to give the mother medical care, a fetus is not killed inside the womb. Instead, a fetus might be carried as long as possible and then delivered via early induced labor or C-section and immediately placed in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit or in comfort care depending on viability. For example, a cancerous uterus would harm the life of a pregnant mother. Since the intention is not to kill the baby and the procedure itself does not act on a fetus to destroy it, this hysterectomy is not an abortion since it preserves the life and dignity of mother and child even if the child does not survive. These alternative procedures to abortion are protected underDobbsbecause they are life-saving maternal medical care. The talk also addressed cases of rape and incest. These are evil and criminal acts and need to be fully punished, but no child should be punished for the crimes of their father. The mother should be supported through this difficult pregnancy and not be subjected to the “fix” of abortion, a “fix” that takes away her baby forever and does not take away the trauma of rape. Again, the pro-life movement provides women who have experienced rape or incest with the dignity, love and resources necessary to care for her already existent child. Pro-life organizations provide women with free resources likehousing,pre-natal careand baby clothes, continuously upholding the lives of every mother, father and child. Even after an abortion,organizationsexist to heal mothers and fathers of post-abortive psychological trauma. As I witnessed from my vandalized flyer, minority views on this college campus are often shut down. I would like to see our Rice community practice critical thinking and healthy dialogue with these difficult topics so that every perspective can be considered. Although the Catholic Church opposes abortion, you don’t need religion to know that each human life is valuable. Do you believe that each person is worth fighting for, no matter the circumstances? How are you upholding the dignity of the forgotten in our society? The homeless, the infirm, the single mother, the unborn — they all need our care and attention. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2023_7,"To the Stanford Administration and the Stanford Community, Our graduate student workers are in the process of organizing a union. This important, legally protected and democratic process ensures that graduate student workers will have the power to collectively participate in shaping their work environment. We, alongside over 150 other postdocs at the time of publication, stand in solidarity with graduate student workers and wholeheartedly support their unionization effort. As postdocs at Stanford, we know firsthand how critical the work of graduate student workers is to the core research and teaching missions of the University. This work is indispensable for the functioning of the University and to our own success. For this reason, we stand in solidarity with graduate student workers and call on the University to respect their right to unionize. Graduate student workers are the driving force of Stanford’s academic excellence. However, the lack of fair compensation for their work that is commensurate with the cost of living is detrimental to graduate productivity and their personal well-being. According to theBill on Affordabilitypublished in October of 2022 by the Graduate Student Council (GSC , Stanford graduate students’ income over the last decade has consistently fallen into the Very Low-Income category, and 78% of graduate students in the most recent survey affirmed they do not meet the minimum standards for financial well-being. Furthermore, annual salary increases have not kept pace with record-high inflation rates and increasing housing costs. In addition, many graduate students experience food insecurity and lack of access to transportation. These circumstances make pursuing a Stanford graduate degree especially challenging for international students and students from marginalized backgrounds. Based on these concerns, the GSC has worked tirelessly to advocate for better conditions for graduate student workers with the University administration, including salaries commensurate with cost of living, better healthcare coverage and sustainable transit benefits. Disappointingly, administrators have repeatedly dismissed the data collected by the GSC that support their concerns on affordability. The University also failed to consult the GSC when setting next year’s minimum salary, despite having promised otherwise. The University’srepeated lack of collaboration and communication with the GSCon affordability issues has demonstrated that real change for graduate student workers can only come through unionization, giving them an equal seat at the table when demanding better conditions. A union empowers workers to seek better working and living conditions with the University administration through structured, legally-enforced collective bargaining and increased solidarity. We support the process by which graduate student workers are organizing and ask Stanford to remain neutral while graduate students undergo the democratic decision of forming a union. Further, we ask the University to refrain from joining Duke University in attempting tooverturnthe National Labor Relations Board ruling that grants graduate students at private universities the right to organize a union. Should the graduate student workers vote to unionize, we hope that the University will recognize the democratically-elected union and conduct negotiations in good faith.

crimson_2023_49,"I am Asian. More specifically, I am Hmong. The Hmong people are a Southeast Asian ethnic group mostly from China, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar. My Hmong parents fled from their homes in war-torn Vietnam to America in search of new lives. Now, nearly 50 years since the first wave of Hmong refugees arrived in America, the United States Hmong population exceeds 300,000, primarily clustered in California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Growing up in California’s Central Valley, I was surrounded by a rich Pan-Asian community — including many, many other Hmong people. It was in that context that my parents endlessly reiterated the value of learning as the ultimate means of social mobility. As my mother still never ceases to remind me when I call home: “Education is key.” And if education is indeed the key, Harvard is the door swinging wide open. But an unpleasant reality lurked on the other side. Despite the fact that approximately 20 percent of Harvard College is Asian, I have only encountered one other Hmong undergraduate out of a student body numbering more than 7,000. And, none of Harvard’s publicly available demographic data reflects this diversity blindspot. Instead, Harvard has amalgamated all Asian ethnicities under one umbrella term. The monolithic label of “Asian” obscures more than it reveals. In my experience, most of the Asian population at Harvard is of East Asian descent, while many Southeast Asian populations, like Vietnamese, Thai, Lao, Khmer, or Hmong people are less prominent. The label of “Asian” smashes and blends this jumble of distinct communities and cultures into a homogenous consolidation. In reality, the Pan-Asian experience is complex. It’s a product of geographical, cultural, and historical distinctions that accentuate a plethora of totally different languages, cuisines, religions, and cultures. Although there is certainly a collective Asian American experience, my life as a Hmong individual (specifically the son of Hmong refugee parents is vastly different from that of a Chinese, Japanese, or Indian person. To group the South Asian experience with the Southeast Asian and East Asian experience is an injustice to the rich individuality of each Asian ethnicity. Simply put, not all Asians are the same. And by treating them as such, Harvard undermines its stated commitment to diversity. To honor the various lived experiences of Asians, Harvard must make disaggregated demographic data public. First, disaggregation would directly counter the colonialist tendency to label all Asians under one umbrella term. Such language eerily resembles historically racist terms like “easterner” or “Oriental.” Second, distinguishing Asian ethnicities would reveal inequities that would otherwise be obscured. For instance, the recent fall of race-based affirmative action, although some perceive it as beneficial to Asian Americans, will likely hurt refugee Southeast Asians and other marginalized groups that have historically benefited from affirmative action. Without clear numbers, the magnitude of this effect will be difficult to decipher. With affirmative action newly overturned, Harvard can still commit to diversity in admissions by officially reporting its demographics — upholding its commitment to veritas in the process. Our university ought to reveal the existing heterogeneity of the Asian diaspora on this campus as a step towards promoting further diversity. Harvard need not specify every minute ethnic distinction within its Asian population, but it should provide a more nuanced and transparent picture. Growing up, universities like Harvard symbolized keys to intellectual, academic, and socioeconomic freedom. If our university is truly devoted to supporting marginalized Asian communities, the first step is to disaggregate our demographics. Z.

wildcat_arizona_2023_6,"Jonathan Bonilla Leon While it varies from person to person, a “situationship” can be most broadly described as the gray area between two people who aren’t in a labeled relationship but aren’t quite friends either. Olivia KruppMarch 17, 2023 A few months ago, a friend showed me an instagram post of some couple I vaguely knew. “Look how cute they are. They look so good together,” she said. I agreed. They are cute. I followed our adoration of their cuteness by asking how long they’ve been dating. “Oh, they aren’t dating. They’re kind of just in a situationship,” she said. She followed it with a mixture of a laugh and uncomfortable smile. I nodded and smiled back. I reassured her that I understood but while doing so I began to feel like I was actually reassuring myself. While it varies from person to person, a situationship can be most broadly described as the gray area between two people who aren’t in a labeled relationship but aren’t quite friends either. It’s amongst the likes of phrases such as “we’re talking,” “we’re a thing,” or even “we’re snapchatting.”GoogleTrendsreports the word hitting an all time high in popularity, as of February 2023. Oxford dictionary describes a situationship as a romantic or sexual relationship that is not considered to be formal or established. The sample sentence below the definition reads, “I’m trying to turn our situationship into something more serious.” If we aren’t the ones saying it, we’re hearing it – and vice versa. While it is undeniable that relationships, especially in college, can be trying and complex – one cannot help but wonder about the damage done to a generation who can’t learn to commit. Or rather, one that doesn’t want to. Unfortunately for most of Gen-Z, we have created a culture in which the mere thought of being in something serious is seen as a bind similar to marriage. Instead, most would rather play house and do every single thing people in relationships do – just without the pesky label of boyfriend or girfriend. Herein lies the shiny appeal and short shelf-life of situationships. For a generation who has become accustomed to automated-responses like “I’m not ready,” or “I don’t like labels,” anything else seems almost abnormal. In fact, we can probably count on one hand the amount of people we know who are in labeled, committed relationships.A survey taken in 2022found that 68% of millennials have been in a relationship while only 34% of Gen-Z can say the same. The statistic is significant and yet not at all surprising. What happened? The question isn’t an easy one to answer. The phobia of labels and decrease in dating is a fairly recent and ever-growing epidemic within our age group – its effects resulting in terms like “situationship.” It feels probable that the explanation for this new phenomenon stems from social media and the illusion of choice more than anything else. Through media like dating apps, Instagram and Tiktok, we are oversaturated with beautiful people, places and things at our fingertips. This influx of media and perceived options creates a fantasy world before our eyes, distorting the way we view ourselves and our relationships with other people. Dole out a few more likes, scroll just a little bit longer: there’s always something better out there and your 3,000 instagram followers prove it so. Everyone is interchangeable, just small pixels in a sea of endless and seemingly accessible options. Keep scrolling. Whether we’re conscious of it or not, this illusion is infiltrating our lives. The idea that there is a better option out there, that the grass is greener somewhere else – it isn’t the truth. This delusion has left us paralyzed and socially stunted, evolving us backwards at rapid speed. A study done bySurvey Center on American Lifereports nearly one in five American men admitting to not having a single close friend while 59% of men and women are able to identify just one person as their best friend. These statistics counter a culture engulfed with dating apps, influencers and Instagram following. Shouldn’t we feel more connected than ever? Social behavioral norms made regular through social media likeghostingor Instagram stalking have turned once authentic interactions into a game. We size up meaning through relationships via their spot on our snapchat best friend list or whether we’ve posted together on instagram – something our parents never experienced. While our followers are the highest they’ve ever been, our connections with other people have never been more watered down. In truth, we exist in a state of perceived closeness with the people around us. Perhaps this is why we struggle to form real relationships – we’ve tricked ourselves into thinking we have them all already. Unfortunately, so much of Gen-Z wants their cake and they want to eat it too. They want the benefits of having a boyfriend or girlfriend – the emotional support, the company and the bonding – without the commitment of actually having the title. It’s easy to get wrapped up in the seemingly beneficial aspects of a relationship like this and even easier to become wrapped up in the pursuit of the next best thing. The truth is, real and meaningful connections, especially in 2023, are not a dime a dozen. The Instagram models you follow don’t know you exist and you cannot swipe right on someone in real life. People are not always interchangeable and there is no substitute for real life relationships and people – especially the romantic ones. While looking at modern relationships through this lens, it’s easy to understand how the “situationships” we so often experience aren’t based in reality. The lack of interest to create a deeper connection doesn’t make the couple on instagram a situationship – it makes them friends. This terminology and culture we have created is not one we need to reassure ourselves is normal or even healthy – the beauty being that we can choose to opt out if we so desire. Like anything else, there is always a gray area within relationships, especially for college students. We are young, unsure and unaware of exactly what we want. The notion, however, that someone being non-commital is anything other than them being non-committal is problematic, exhausting and harmful to your mental health. For many of us, the grass is as green as it’s going to get. FollowOlivia Krupp onTwitter Olivia is a sophomore studying journalism. She enjoys reading, foreign films, and poetry in her free time."
state_press_2023_12,"There’s a problem with how ASU is handling its football department. While the University has made an effort to improve fan engagement off the field, the actual performance of the team has left fans with little reason to stick around Mountain America Stadium. Last Saturday’s game saw a historically severe loss to Fresno State. This 29-0 result marks the first time since1988that the Sun Devils been shutout at home, and the student section was nearly vacant by the end of halftime. “In order to win in college football, you need everybody behind you, Coach Kenny Dillingham said on Monday during the postgame press conference. We need people to stay behind us, stay behind our players, and stay behind the process that it takes to be successful. This game performance comes amidan NCAA investigationinto the University s alleged recruiting violations during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make matters worse, ASU decided a self-imposedbowl banwould soften the inevitable blow from the results of the NCAA investigation. After the disappointing loss, fans took their frustrations about ASU s disappointing defeat to X (formerly known as Twitter . ASU alumnus Jeffrey Krieg similarly expressed frustration as a long-time Sun Devil football fan and season ticket holder. Krieg described how he set up an 80-inch TV with surround sound in his garage to watch games from the comfort of his home because of his lack of motivation to come to the game in Tempe. We’re not only supposed to beat them Fresno State , but we’re supposed to blow them out, he said. “I didn’t watch the entire game because I was just disgusted. For fans like Krieg, this waning enthusiasm for ASU football deters them from even attending games in person. From 2019 to 2022, the total attendance decreased by 14%, from 49,166 to 43,081, about a tenth of the stadium capacity. The attendance dip coincides with a worsening record since 2021, with the team finishing 8-5 in 2021, 3-9 in 2022, and starting the 2023 season at 1-2. The University tries to engage football fans with a variety of tailgating events, offering 10 parking lots that open five hours before the game and even upgrading concession prices in August. But fans are still not showing up, and those who do head for the exits early. However, no matter how good or disappointing the team is, tailgating and going to the game in the desert heat is difficult. It was close to or over 100 degrees at the Southern Utah, Oklahoma State and Fresno State games. Fans still have been few reasons to stick around for a losing team in that heat. Thus, ASU can t rely on these off-field engagement efforts to keep the Sun Devil football spirit alive. Until the Sun Devils can improve their performance, nothing in ASU’s playbook can cure growing fan apathy as the losses continue to pile up. Edited by Mia Osmonbekov, Walker Smith and Shane Brennan.

rice_thresher_2023_66,"ByThresher Editorial Board1/31/23 10:51pm Housing and Dining recently spoke out about an unacceptable number of missing ceramic plates from serveries across campus, prompting several college presidents and coordinators to remind students not to throw these plates away or leave them in shared spaces. The issue has gotten so bad that H&D has stated that they will begin charging colleges each time they find one in the trash. We should be mortified that the situation has come to this. Seriously, y’all? We’re all smart enough to get into this school, and we’re definitely smart enough to distinguish between paper plates that are able to be disposed of and ceramic plates that most certainly are not. We realize many students are not yet used to the pre-pandemic non-disposable plates. But that is utterly no excuse for students throwing these plates in the trash, leaving them in public spaces or keeping them for their own personal use. This is just part of a trend we’ve noticed in this post-pandemic era where shared things and spaces are not treated with the respect they deserve. Choosing to be part of this community means treating H&D staff and communal spaces with basic levels of respect. H&D will be adding bins at the colleges to make it even easier to return your plates. H&D staff does so much work for us already — it is distressing and insulting to make them count the number of plates in the trash in addition to their other duties. As students, we should do the absolute bare minimum of returning our plates so that someone else can wash them. We always ask for the administration to trust us, to treat us like adults. But only a child would throw away a reusable plate or leave it somewhere expecting a real adult to clean up after them.

stanforddaily_2023_49,"Some say the unifying Stanford experience is CS 106A, a class that many will have taken during their student career. We say that it is the arts. A look at class enrollment data reveals the arts’ central position in student life. The Department of Music saw a total of 1,573 enrollments during this fall quarter, ranking seventh among undergraduate departments in terms of enrollment. Arts-leaning divisions combined — namely music, art history, dance, art studies, film and theater and performance studies — have 3,310 enrollments, surpassing all departments and divisions besides computer science. The numbers tell us that most of us have been in an arts class, regardless of our field of study. We’d venture to say that almostallof us have created or consumed student art in some form or another — be it an a cappella show, a theater production or that student band concert at The Arbor you walked by on a Friday night. Whether we realize it or not, the arts shape how we interact with others on campus.

You may not even be aware of Stanford’s unofficial jugger team, whichinvitesanyone from students to dining hall staff to join in weekly games reminiscent of capture the flag. What is the overarching theme in these student performances, late-night get-togethers and club opportunities? It is that the arts and cultural events are crucial to creating a unique, safe space for us to relax, experiment and regroup as a student body. Stanford would not be the community that it is without its artistic opportunities. And this is what we attempt to convey in this issue. “Intermission,” named after the weekly culture-centric newspaper that The Daily put out between 1989 and 2013, tries to bring the arts back to center stage. Departing from the original — which detailed campus goings-on, as well as personal stories andquirky advice columns— our “Intermission” special issue aims to spotlight hidden corners of campus arts and culture, those experiences that don’t make the headlines but scaffold our student experience. Insofar as an intermission is a pause, we want to inspire you to stop and notice the remarkable everyday creativity that surrounds us. We especially hope to introduce you to some of the humans who are indispensable to making those essential experiences happen.

thetech_mit_2023_10,"On February 8th at 11:40 AM, during the 49th annual MLK Luncheon, 40 Black students mobilized and entered Walker Memorial despite the event being at capacity. While Dr. Angela Davis’ activism and scholarship brings great inspiration, Black students did not mobilize to see her. Nor did they stand in the room because they were dying to have lunch with administration. Black students entered the event to demonstrate that we will not be silenced and to ensure our experiences are not sanitized for the comfort of others. This effort was organized in response to malicious events that occurred during the first week of classes, but Black people on campus deal with nearly constant affronts that spur our organizing including daily racial aggressions, traumatizing encounters with MIT police, and years-long deferrals on meaningful action to address our needs. What happened the first week of classes, detailed below, is both symbolic and symptomatic of larger issues of anti-Blackness within the Institute. Black Hack Summary Each year during Black History Month, the Black Student Union (BSU and Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA take over MIT’s Lobby 7 for “Black Hack,” an installation and/or demonstration often used to celebrate Black scholars or amplify issues that affect Black people on campus. In preparation for this year’s Black Hack, the BSU received permission for an installation in Lobby 7. On Monday, February 6, students hung posters that posed two key questions: “What actually are MIT’s values?” and “What makes a welcoming community?” Black students answered these questions with chalked replies on the poster that revealed a stark contrast between the lived experiences of Black students, and MIT s official values portrayed by the five brightly-colored,billboard-scale banners that run floor to ceiling in Lobby 7. The lived experiences of Black students do not reflect an environment of “Belonging and Community,” “Openness and Respect,” or “Excellence and Curiosity,” as purported by theMIT Values statement. Less than 12 hours after being displayed, the Black Hack installation was defaced. Concerns written by Black students from the BSU, like the persistence of ignorance, optics over action, “covering up problems”, and gentrification, were crossed out and rewritten by unknown actors as knowledge, action, “problem solving”, and development, respectively. The perspectives and experiences of Black students were crossed out, sanitized, and editorialized. Monday night, Black students went out again to display flyers explaining what happened. Flyers were placed all through Lobby 7, down the infinite, and surrounding the original posters. The vandalized poster was left up purposely as it was exemplary evidence of the lived experience of Black students at MIT; when we raise concerns, speak out, or challenge systems that harm us, members of the MIT community do not believe us. By Tuesday morning, all of these flyers had been taken down. All that remained was the vandalized banner. This is what spurred students to mobilize and disrupt the MLK Luncheon on February 8th. The Larger Problem Does MIT fulfill the values it claims? In April 2022, President Rafael Reif, Provost Cynthia Barnhart and Chancellor Melissa Nobles shared thevalues statementwith the community. However, releasing a statement does not materially change the environment at MIT. In order to “face difficult facts, speak plainly about failings in our systems, and work to overcome them” (as proclaimed in the values statement , the Institute must follow through on its commitments. We are tired of nice words and drawn-out committee processes; we demand that MIT take action to promote student public safety and DEI efforts in concrete ways. We demand transparency. The Black Hack demonstration is yet another example of a lack of fulfillment on behalf of the Institute. Although MIT administration has attempted to display that they are listening to the voices of Black students, their actions have been inadequate and superficial. For example,The MIT Strategic Action Plan for Belonging, Achievement, & Composition, released earlier last semester, features manyoptionaldiversity initiatives — such as training that is ‘encouraged’ but not required for faculty and supervisors, and overall lacks any clear structures regarding accountability for instances of racial discrimination and bias, despiterepeated protests from students on the Strategic Planning Committee. Similar to this plan, many DEI initiatives at MIT take years to complete but don’t tangibly improve the culture at MIT, and we are left with a similar set of optional recommendations with minimal action. This is not a standalone incident; there is a longstanding history of MIT administration making empty promises to students and not using the entirety of their many resources to see them through sincerely. In 2015, administration committed to executedemands made by the Black Students’ Union and Black Graduate Student Association.However, the implementation of these demands falls short. One of the things the Institute committed to was creating a Diversity representative in each department. And although many academic departments have hired diversity officers, they face a large financial burden, as MIT doesn’t provide them with allocated funding to follow through on DEI initiatives. Another demand centered on increasing accountability for departmental performance, specifically on the data for the matriculation and graduation rates of underrepresented graduate students. In response to this demand, aDiversity Dashboardwas created to give more details about demographics across the institute, which explores gender and race/ethnicity of the MIT community by school, degree, and gives graduation rates by race for the past few years. In contrast, the leadership of each department receives a curated report on “demographic comparisons”; this includes important information on representation within majors, flux between majors, and graduation rates for each department and lab that is not available to everyone else. With this, the administration is still refusing Black students the full transparency of information that we are demanding. Instead, we have been left with a familiar sidelining and lack of tangible action, or thorough plan to act:“The strategic action plan for diversity, equity and inclusion will further address this recommendation.” Public Safety We see a similar lack of transparency and meaningful change in the Institute’s hollow improvements to public safety on campus. Three years ago, after the “national reckoning” following the murder of George Floyd by police, and afterconcerns of police bias arose on campus, over5,000 MIT community members organizedto demand substantive changes to policing and public safety. The need to reimagine public safety predates George Floyd and still persists. Just in January, 29 year old Tyre Nichols was beaten by Memphis police during a traffic stop and later died in the hospital. After the release of footage from a body camera and a nearby street camera, it was found that the footage contradicted the story of the officers on duty. Issues with the modern policing system have also touched us locally with the fatal shooting of UMass student Arif Sayed Faisal by Cambridge PD when he was having a mental health crisis, a mere block away from Pika, an independent living group at MIT. And yet MIT has not made a statement, much less having a conversation on public safety and police reform. The fact that MIT PD’s policies are“very similar”to those of Cambridge PD is especially alarming and evidence that the change is overdue. MIT’s approach to public safety must evolve in response to this persistent inadequacy of policing seen over hundreds of years of American history, and in our own backyard with Faisal. To address issues regarding public safety at MIT, theWorking Group on Reimagining Public Safety at MITwas formed in 2020. After two years, the administration published a condensedsummaryof the recommendations that proposed several changes that would begin to transform public safety on campus including having unarmed community service officers (CSOs and/or clinicians respond to routine calls and mental health calls, instead of police. However, these recommendations have not been committed to. Although MIT has acknowledged that many Boston-area schools have implemented unarmed CSOs, MIT still hasn’t adopted similar measures, which already have existing models that are ready for implementation. In fact, former President Reif called these solutions “far-reaching,” and instead, the administration has planned toconsiderhow to enact these changes. Following a working group drawing upon undergraduate and graduate students devoting their labor to this serious issue, no substantive changes have been explicitly committed to. Further, MIT has withheld the full, data-driven report that was created during the working group, another salient example of non-transparency. We are tired of the constant cycle of issues that impact us being shuttled to working groups and committees that end up going nowhere and result in no concrete implementation of solutions. It feels as if the Institute waits for us to exhaust our energy for change, until the issue fades into the background, unattended to until it happens again, and then we’re back at square one. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whom the Institute celebrated this month, is famous for the quote “Justice delayed, is justice denied.” Following these words, we say enough is enough and we won’t let this issue of public safety be delayed any longer. Demand 1: We demand that MIT, in the name of full transparency regarding public safety, release the full report created by the Reimagining Public Safety working group. As a school dedicated to shaping the next generation of engineers, scientists and problem solvers, we deserve to see these findings to ensure that a sound, data-driven approach is being pursued for the protection of the MIT community. Demand 2: We demand that MIT swiftly implements an alternative, unarmed response to routine calls and mental health crises. Other campuses have implemented such solutions already. The need is apparent and requires action now. We hope President Sally Kornbluth will chart a new path for MIT where the concerns of Black students are listened to and acted upon, rather than silenced and sidelined as they have been in the past. If MIT truly wishes to live up to its own values of belonging and being a welcoming community to all of its members, these demands are only the first step. Until we see substantive changes, we will not be silent. Ayantu Tamene is a 1st year undergraduate student in Computer Science and Molecular Biology and a member of the MIT Black Students’ Union.

crimson_2023_69,"Today, University President Claudine Gay is testifying in front of Congress about antisemitism on college campuses. As she gives her remarks, President Gay must not forget the ongoing climate of fear and intimidation facing Harvard’s Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities since the outbreak of war and what many scholars and lawyers have called a genocide in Gaza. On Nov. 1, hedge fund billionaire Bill A. Ackman ’88 spoke at the Jewish Leaders Forum. The event was organized by Harvard Chabad and took place following his calls for the mass doxxing of pro-Palestinian students whose organizationsco-signed a statementin response to the Oct. 7 attacks. Ackman’s invitation to campus was only one of the many incidents of Harvard’s neglect of students’ safety concerns. In the same week that Ackman and other prominent figures lambasted pro-Palestinian students on social media, I saw the faces and names of my peersplastered on a truckdriving around campus, each accompanied by the title of “Harvard’s Leading Antisemites.” The truck was funded by Accuracy in Media, a conservative advocacy group. According toan interviewwith two doxxed students, the majority of those individuals were Black and brown. It took Harvard almost two weeks just to privately email affected students about atask force for doxxed students. By that point, students had faceddeath threatsand found their personal information circulated online. Soon after, Accuracy in Media sent the truck to some of the students’ hometowns. Harvard’s failure to treat this incident with the urgency it deserved endangered pro-Palestinian students and promoted prejudice on campus. A significant increase in antisemitic hate crimes in the United States has accompanied these targeted attacks on pro-Palestinian students. In response to these heinous attacks on the Jewish community, Harvard created anantisemitism advisory group. The administration’s move is commendable and warranted — and that same institutional support should also be extended to Muslims and Arabs on campus whose communities have faced a similar upsurge in Islamophobic, anti-Arab, and anti-Palestinian racism: The Council on American-Islamic Relations documented anincrease in Islamophobic incidentsand hate crimes in the U.S. of more than 180 percent between Oct. 7 and Oct. 24. The director of research and advocacy of that organization noted that this surging hate has been born out of rhetoric particularly targeting Palestinian communities. Why is Harvard refusing to extend the same valuable institutional resource it provides to Jewish students to their Arab and Muslim peers? The administration’s inadequate response tells me that I, as a Palestinian, do not meet the standards for safety or support. The lack of action taken by our university has potentially dangerous implications in light of recent anti-Arab and Islamophobic attacks on other college campuses. At Stanford University, campus police are investigating allegations that a student wearing a shirt with the Syrian city of Damascus written in Arabic on it was struck by a car, the driver of which yelled, “Fuck you people.”At George Washington University, students reported instances of strangers ripping hijabs from the heads of Muslim students. Andat Yale University, a message declaring “Death to Palestine” was found written on a whiteboard inside of a student dorm building. On Nov. 25, this bigotry turned into bullets. That day,three Palestinian college students in Vermontwere shot while speaking Arabic and wearing keffiyehs, traditional Palestinian scarves. That attack on Hisham Awartani, a student at Brown University; Kinnan Abdalhamid, a student at Haverford University; and Tahseen Ali Ahmed, a student at Trinity University, should remind the nation of the consequences of ignoring anti-Palestinian racism. These racist attacks are not isolated incidents. As Hisham, who was left paralyzed from the chest down by the assault, bravely noted in a statement, he is “but one casualty in this much wider conflict” against Palestinians globally, whether in the United States or inOccupied Palestinian Territories. Harvard’s failure to adequately respond to the scale of this crisis leaves its Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim students to wonder, “Are we next?” Our university, like many of its peers, has already failed these members of our community by not acting faster. Only by leading the way with lasting action can Harvard win back our trust and set a standard for universities nationwide. This is what President Gay must have in mind when she testifies before Congress today. But her words in front of the government are not enough. Whether by divestingits nearly $200 million in investmentstied to Israeli settlements in Palestine; creating an advisory committee to tackle Islamophobia, anti-Arab, and anti-Palestinian racism; reinstating anevicted pro-Palestinian proctor; or extending an invitation to Palestinian students to meet with President Claudine Gay, Harvard must do more to protect us on our own campus. These acts are not just for me, but for Hisham and other Palestinians on college campuses who are deeply worried for their safety. For the people of Gaza gasping for help and calling for a permanent ceasefire. For every member of the Harvard community in need of assurance that Islamophobia, anti-Arab sentiment, and all forms of hate have no place on this campus. For humanity. Mahmoud M.

For international students, here’s alist of some internationally available support hotlinesthat might be helpful. — Eleanor V. Wikstrom and Christina M. Xiao, Editorial Chairs — Cara J. Chang, President During my first weekend at Harvard Law School, I received an email saying that aclassmate in our 80-person sectionhad died by suicide. A native Oklahoman passionate about immigration law, Jeremy was the first person I met at the Law School. As I nervously waited to pick up my orientation packet, Jeremy kindly struck up a conversation with me and told me about his recent road trip to Cambridge with his dog, Louis. I remember thinking to myself that law school couldn’t be so bad if people like Jeremy were in my class. Tragically, Jeremy’s story is not unique at Harvard. At the Law School, at least three students have taken their own lives in the last five years, and between 2007 and 2017, nine undergraduates died by suicide. In 2012, The Crimson estimated the suicide rate at the College was two to four times the national collegiate average, depending on the metric used. Last fall, the University implemented anew mental health initiativeto improve campus resources and raise awareness. However, these recent actions fall short in significant ways and myopically miss a crucial point about mental health altogether. Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services has beenfrequently criticizedfor its slow and bureaucratic nature, which, for some patients last year, includedsix-week wait timesfor therapy appointments. The new mental health initiative strives to streamline the patient intake process and provides students with a teletherapy alternative through the third-party platform TimelyMD. While a good start, far more is needed to bring campus resources to an acceptable level. For the past 10 years, students have called for CAMHS to reform its care timeline, which provides only short-term counseling with sessions spaced out every two to three weeks. Harvard students need longer term and more frequent care, and the University ought to dramatically invest in CAMHS to make this a reality, along with subsidizing the $35 copay students on University medical insurance pay for many off-campus visits. While making treatment access easier and more comprehensive is important, focusing on just this jarringly misses a crucial piece of the puzzle. Mental health issues don’t exist in a vacuum. Instead of making efforts to address structural causes of poor student mental health, like academic and institutional stressors, Harvard’s new initiative continues a trend of reluctance to interrogate the impacts of its environment on its students. When it comes to grades,rising average GPAshave placed greater pressure on students to avoid previously acceptable grades like an A- or (God forbid a B+. Moreover, a lack of transparency in grade distributions can make students feel competitive even in introductory classes, like Expos 20, where perceived difficulty of obtaining an A has left students to speculate about the existence of an unspoken curve. At the Law School, the ostensibly less stressful Pass/Fail grading system is patheticallyundercut by the distinctionbetween Dean’s Scholar, Honors, Pass, and Low Pass categories. That students never receive feedback on any work in many classes prior to taking an eight-hour intensive final exam — worth 90 percent or more of the course grade — is yet another structural factor that places undue stress on students’ mental wellbeing. Unrealistic academic workloads and expectations are also actively detrimental to students’ mental health. First year law students are required to take 18 credits their first semester, yet themaximum allowable creditsfor successive semesters is 16. Additionally, many students can readily recall examples of unacceptable pedagogy by professors that left them anxious and embarrassed like the dreaded and oft-abused cold call. It is indefensible to justify student suffering on the grounds of a trial by fire or by appealing to tradition. At the minimum, the University could better enforce existing academic policies, like the prohibition of assignment deadlines during most of Reading Period, or elsewise hold professors to higher standards of respecting students’ wellbeing. Harvard’s leave policy, too, is an institutional failure. According to 2017 reporting by The Crimson,one in 20students takes time off every year, some involuntarily. For students dealing with severe mental health issues, Harvard often imposes strict requirements for their time off and return to campus, likeinflexible treatment and monitoring guidelines, as conditions of re-enrollment. One such student “contract” hascome under scrutinyin an ongoing lawsuit concerning a 2015 student suicide after Harvard imposed unforgiving and non-negotiable terms for enrollment following a previous suicide attempt. Harvard’s draconian rules allow it to escape liability at the expense of its students. It’s no wonder theRuderman Family Foundationhas scored Harvard’s leave policy at a D-. More broadly, Harvard students frequently encounter an intractable and unaccommodating bureaucracy. At the Law School, class recording requests are only approved in limited circumstances and when made one full business day in advance. Last fall, the administration ignored a student petition to allow a remote option for the last three days of class following Thanksgiving break. The adage that Harvard doesn’t have to care about you because it’s Harvard should be evidence enough that the University needs to tune in to its students’ wellbeing. As we continue into another semester, Harvard must take a serious look at its handling of the ongoing student mental health emergency. By ignoring its institutional responsibility to address structural factors, the University sends a dangerous message: Our campus environment is destined to make students unhappy, and we should just plod onward by developing individual coping mechanisms. Worse still, a culture of cruel optimism blames students when those paltry solutions inevitably fail in the absence of meaningful change. This is wholly inadequate. We must work toward genuine reform that confronts the ugly sides of a Harvard education. Our students deserve better. Vinny K. Byju ’20 is a first-year student at Harvard Law School."
rice_thresher_2023_9,"ByFariha Ahmad11/14/23 10:47pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. The silence is deafening, and I wonder. As the death toll in Palestine continues to rise, the silence of college administrators, faculty and even students sends those of us watching the events unfolding in Gaza and the West Bank into near psychological isolation. Outside of family and select friends, no one is acknowledging the desolate, tear-stricken, burdened people who are sickened by the violence foisted onto the people of Palestine. Besides the fact that Western media, governmental officials and university administrators continue to discount the scenes coming from the ground in Gaza, there is also an undercurrent of fear: If you feel for or are in any way attached to the people of Palestine, youcannot say anything. At the doctorate level, we are afraid of stipends being withheld, immigration status being threatened or of professional opportunities being denied. Outside of our lab spaces and offices, the threat of hate crimes is growing:the exponential uptick in complaints and bias incidents against Muslims reported to the Council on American-Islamic Relations,the harassment of students at the University of Texas at Austin at a Palestinian Solidarity Committee eventandthe murder of a 6-year old Palestinian-American boy in Chicago. All the while, there are mental counts running: days to when hospitals stop functioning, the count of aid trucks trickling in, the numbers of journalists, doctors, children, people, dead. The silence is deafening, and I wonder. We cannot say that we are pro-Palestine or anti-Zionist without people thinking we are antisemitic and yet,we are not antisemitic. We cannot say we will give, we will pray, we feel for the people of Palestine without someone saying, “What about the people in Israel?” We cannot use the words “genocide” or “ethnic cleansing” without a countering of “these people are a casualty of war” (thoughacademic expertsandinternational organizationssuch as the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights will endorse thatthe genocide of Palestinians is imminent . We cannot say, we cannot say, we cannot say. The silence is deafening, and I wonder. I wonder how people can acknowledge that something so wrong is happening in the world and feel no sense of wanting to right it. Regardless of whether that action — signing a petition for a ceasefire, donating to a relief group for children, posting on social media, attending a vigil — feels like a bandage over the gaping wound that is Gaza, I wonder if people think these actions are worthless. I wonder if people really do not hold themselves ethically accountable. I believe that one day, I will have to account for my actions to a higher power; I also believe that one day, my children will ask me what I did during my time at Rice, as the world and I witnessed what UN experts warned to be theethnic cleansing of Palestinians. I will tell them how I prayed, how I donated, how I protested, how I watched, how I spoke, how I wrote. I will tell them how some of my colleagues were brave enough to read and to stand and to take care of others. I will tell them that I wondered how other colleagues could be so concerned about being politically correct when, regardless of where they “stood,” they did nothing to acknowledge the loss of life or the effect it had on their classmates, their community, their world. The silence is deafening, and I wonder and I wonder and I wonder. I wonder if people realize that there is so much they can do right from home. They can learn. They can ask questions. They can spread awareness. They can protest. They can boycott. They can amplify the voices of Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims, activists, people who are trying to make up for the fact that their tax dollars are reconstituted into bombs that spill the blood of thousands of children and innocents. They can do so much, and I am left wondering why nothing is done at all. The silence is deafening, and I wonder. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

state_press_2023_45,"A decision from the Arizona Court of Appeals represents a win for all local businesses near ASU. Last month, the Arizona Court of Appeals lifted the injunction on thecase between Shady Park and Mirabella at ASUin Shady Park’s favor. The injunction placed heavy restrictions on the club regarding hosting live music events, citing chiefly First Amendment concerns among others. Court documents from the Arizona Court of Appeals stated that the injunction “burdens more speech than necessary to address the asserted harm.” The Arizona Court of Appeals has ruled in our favor. Please read our statement for information on the trial and for what s next regarding our fight to bring the music back 🦚 Check out the link in our bio for the complete ruling and relevant articles#SaveShadyParkpic.twitter.com/FaKzMahwCa This inevitable decision seems obvious in light of the initial complaint. Unlike what was issued in the injunction, even Mirabella never asked for a curfew on concerts. The injunction was unnecessarily heavy-handed even when looked at from Mirabella’s perspective. According to the appeal, even Mirabella’s own expert testified in the initial trial that just turning the volume down to 65 decibels would help surrounding residents. Issuing a curfew that effectively kills all nighttime shows is absurd, and this injunction was rightfully vacated and remanded. Hopefully, this case can serve as a lesson for the courts to consider less heavy-handed rulings, thinking them through rather than just going for what is seemingly the easiest approach. But furthermore, this case serves as a lesson for ASU; the University needs to use more foresight in its future investments. If anything, Mirabella is a clear-cut example of a lack of foresight. Putting a retirement community in the middle ofTempeand then expecting peace and quiet is ridiculous, and nowthe studentsare footing the bill for ASU’s lack of foresight and common sense – again, who thought thatMill Avenuewould be the ideal spot for a tranquil retirement community? ASU should not be making blunders like Mirabella, especiallyin light of the expansions the University is making into other statesand just how much these expansions cost the school. Again, it’s important to remember that students foot the bill for these mistakes at the end of the day through tuition. Also, and more importantly, they pay through sacrificing the student experiences that come with living on or near campus – student experiences that ASU is supposed to be keeping in its best interests. Imagine if ASU had chosen a different location with cheaper real estate and a quieter surrounding area to put their retirement community in. Imagine what that money savedcould have been spent on, like finding solutions tothe housing crisis that ASU is currently facingor other things that would directly benefit the vast majority of students’ experiences at the University. In addition, situations like Mirabella s do not look good when the school is making incredibly costly investments in other areas.If ASU is going to be spendinghundreds of thousands of dollars on lobbyingin order to get the funds needed to expand into other areas, they need to show that they can be trusted to think ahead about where they want to expand and what exactly they are trying to create in these areas. Blunders like Mirabella don’t just hurt ASU as a school, they hurt ASU’s student body, taking away experiences that could greatly benefit the vast majority of students. If ASU wants to continue to expand into new areas and break new ground, I hope those in charge will view Mirabella as a lesson and use more forethought in these future developments. They should keep in mindwho,at the end of the day, is paying the bill for the new developments, ormistakes, that ASU may make. Edited by Kate Duffy, Jasmine Kabiri and Caera Learmonth.

rice_thresher_2023_31,"ByThresher Editorial Board9/5/23 10:57pm Rice football kicked off its season with yet another rout at the hands of the University of Texas Longhorns, losing 37-10. At least it wasn’t58-0. With the step-up to the American Athletic Conference and theheavily-coveredtransfer of former five-star recruit and national champion quarterback JT Daniels from West Virginia, the Owls entered their season opener with high expectations. Honestly, when considering the Owls’ performances over the past couple seasons, the final result against America’s No. 11 football team was not surprising. We just wish it were not broadcast on national television. Unfortunately, photos showed a lack of Rice student support for the team, and instead a sea of UT orange. Many Rice students even joined their Longhorn friends in the UT student section. The Marching Owl Band, Rice Owls Dance Team and Rice Cheer were all absent from the game. Rice Rally made a valiant effort as always, but at the end of the day, it’s hard to cheer when Rice is doomed long before kickoff. Such a demoralizing season opener for both the team and its supporters makes it more difficult for students, especially freshmen, to want to follow the Owls and take its football program seriously. It is certainly beneficial for Rice to start the season against a school close enough for students to easily travel to, like Texas. But it does not have to be such a mismatch. Rice does not need to beginevery seasonwith a ‘David vs. Goliath’ situation — especially if David cannot win. The University of Houston, for example, is conveniently located and provides an opportunity for students to see their other Houston-based friends. Rice and UH are moreevenly matched, too; starting the year successfully — or at least not as poorly — may increase hype for an athletic program in real need. Other programs that the Owls could open their season against include similarly academically rigorous and athletically-inclined schools like Vanderbilt University and Duke University. Though a bit far to travel, Rice students may have friends in both places, and the games would be far more balanced than against Texas. Since the hiring of head coach Mike Bloomgren six years ago, the football program has made massive strides in returning back to national relevance. However, starting every season with a depressing loss moves us one step back instead of two steps forward. Our Owls should not be the tune-up game for big schools like Texas. Rice is not a “football school,” and it may never become one. Nevertheless, students should still feel like they can hope for a win once in a while. Playing Texas first takes that away. We should choose not what is easy, but also not what is too hard. Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

crimson_2023_90,"On January 4, Sayed Arif Faisalwas killed by Cambridge police. A student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, a Bangladeshi American, a 20-year-old only child, Faisal’s death sparked protests from the Cambridge community calling for police accountability. Faisal was very probably undergoing a mental health crisis, and instead of helping him, police fatally shot him. As a Bangladeshi immigrant myself, I cannot describe the feelings of anger and grief that I felt when hearing this news. My parents, however, clearly articulated theirs: anger at his death, grief for his parents, and lack of trust in the ability of the police to conduct a thorough investigation. In that moment, the myth of immigrant excellence — of coming to America to achieve a better life — vanished, and all that was left behind was the realization that the police will not protect us. There is an urge, I think, to provide the police with more resources, like body cameras, for the sake of better regulating the system. But bolstering law enforcement does not always keep us safe, for reasons with which we are already all too familiar, although perhaps not well-equipped to see. For South Asians, the stain of British colonialism has never left; the violence perpetuated and the struggle for independence has left behind a legacy of struggle and division. We understand very well the imprint British colonialism has left in our motherlands, and we are aware of our racialized brown bodies in the airport post 9/11, but too often, we fall short at denouncing the American policing system — another tool of colonial and racist/white supremacist/Islamophobic violence, one that does not guarantee safety and protection like it advertises. The United States spends more than 100 billion dollars a year on policing, yet some experts argue that there is no relationship between the number of police present in an area and crime rates. It is clear from the disproportionate impacts that police have on Black people that their presence is not always good for the communities they claim to serve. Many South Asians extend our solidarity with Black Lives Matter by protesting against police brutality and donating to antiracist organizations. However, we often dismiss having discussions of anti-Blackness in our own communities and may believe our efforts are wasted on our parents, who belong to an older generation that can be less socially conscious. To be sure, having these conversations is necessary to create sustained change. But ultimately, atrocities targeting people and bodies we identify as “our own” create powerful feelings of solidarity. This shared sense of vulnerability opens the door wide open for righteous outrage despite these obstacles, just as it did for my parents. This may be uncomfortable for many — as it should be. Narratives of Asian American excellence are designed to placate us and ease our assimilation into the white supremacist fabric of this nation. We may be convinced by the outwardly progressive stance of Cambridge’s government, but they refuse to release the names of the officers involved in Faisal’s shooting, and have placed the man who shot him on paid administrative leave rather than taking stronger action. While we may have nominal freedom to conduct as we choose, what does that mean when the police, a tool of colonial violence, can end our lives on a whim? We should know that we would not be able to live comfortably in this country without the civil rights movement that in many ways fought against police brutality, just as Black Lives Matter does today. Particularly, those of us who come from a privileged caste — meaning that, back home, we wield disproportionate wealth and power, socially, religiously, and politically — must acknowledge the violence that has and will continue to perpetuate towards Black, brown, and low income communities in this country. We can clearly articulate the problems of corruption and violence that exist in our motherlands, but why do we often fail to do so in the United States? Sayed Faisal should be alive today. If proper mental health and emergency response professionals had been available to answer his call, he would not have been viewed as a threat and had his humanity stripped from him. The city of Cambridge should not be able to quietly hide their officers away on what essentially amounts to paid vacation while the community grieves, and we as South Asians have a responsibility to fight against this country’s police system — not just for Faisal and his family, but for every Black and brown American killed by police brutality.

ubyssey_2023_9,"Sept. 29, 2023 Written byMarie Erikson This year’s AMS/GSS Health and Dental plan covers $1,250 in claims for visits with mental health practitioners - equal to last year’s coverage and a reduction from the 2021/2022 policy year. In an interview withThe Ubysseyearlier this September,AMS executives said that a now undone reduction to coveragewas part of an effort by the AMS to combat increasing costs. Students have previouslycriticized the limitations of coverage, forcing them to reexamine whether they can access essential care. Much of the problem lies in the history and expectations of the AMS’ mental health coverage more broadly. Assuming arate of $150 per hour for counselling- higher than the unrealistically low rate AMS president Esmé Decker implied of $100 per hour - the current plan covers only eight full hour-long sessions. Eight sessions can, of course, be helpful to students. Yet, for longer-term problems, this frequency of treatment is not nearly enough. In my own experience, I have had counselling appointments weekly or biweekly for periods of months or years, and while it has been incredibly helpful so far, I currently need my regular appointments to continue indefinitely to maintain a functional level of health. While the AMS supplement helps me access treatment that has been life-changing, it is still merely a supplement; I do not credit it with enabling my access to care. For this policy year, coverage wasreduced to 80 per centof the cost of weekly appointments, down from full coverage in last year, leaving students in situations like mine to manage a cost in the hundreds or thousands. This is a significant amount for anyone, but it is made especially more poignant when students are burdened with tuition and skyrocketing rent costs. Without high incomes or large savings, which is generally not the case among this age demographic, students will often need assistance from family to access the care they need. But even if one’s family is supportive of their efforts, the extent to which a family can provide that resource varies based on their socioeconomic status. In this way, access to care that can be critical and life-saving is only available to students born into middle to high income brackets. While the supplemental coverage from the AMS plan may give more people access, by not covering long-term treatment, students who are unable to pay for themselves or through their family’s support are still being excluded from health care by the AMS because of economic status. Ideally, mental health services would be fully covered under British Columbia’s Medical Services Plan or the University of British Columbia as part of its current budgetary priority to support students in areas including mental health. This could take the form of grants from UBC for students paying out of pocket for mental health care, similar to thefirst-year Student Housing Supplement Grantor theproposed international-student housing bursaryon a broader scale. Such changes could be funded by growing the students’ priorities portion of the operating fund, which for allcategories totalled $54.9 million for the Vancouver campus. Yet if the university is currently not subsidizing the longer-term care it has not offered, the responsibility falls to the AMS, our studentunion, to advocate to UBC on our behalf or create a comprehensive and effective program on its own. To ensure this need is met without the full support of UBC, the AMS needs to more actively prioritize the health and wellbeing of students, the union’s members, in its budget. While smaller changes such as the one-time “emergency” increase to$1500 of coverage for the 2021/22 policy yearare helpful, we as students also need to prevent ourselves from being biased by the paltry numbers we’ve become accustomed to so we can continue to demand that the AMS meet our needs and properly allocate the financial resources we provide when it’s efforts in lobbying the province and UBC fail. It will cost the AMS more, but it is more capable of finding funding for such costs than individuals. And whileAMS VP Finance Abhi Mishra arguedthat there are mental health resources available for UBC students,UBC does not currently provide professional long-term counselling, a critical gap the AMS coverage is intended to fill. A well-functioning system would allow regular appointments to students regardless of their or their family’s financial situation throughout the year. Whether this takes the form of unlimited coverage or a cap several thousand dollars higher is up to the AMS and its insurance partners. Yet for now, the burden lies on us students to demand the support required to allow everyone, regardless of financial resources, to access the health they deserve and need to best succeed in their studies.

stanforddaily_2023_105,"In the past two months, Stanford has been victimized by a succession of antisemitic acts. On April 17, a Nazi swastika wasfoundcarved into the metal panel of a men’s restroom in the History Corner — the fourth time this odious symbol has been found in that location since Feb. 28. Some of these acts have also included the racist n-word and the letters “KKK.” On April 3, a mezuzah wastorn awayfrom the doorframe of an undergraduate residence and broken. And on March 10, a Jewish undergraduate studentdiscovereda caricature of Adolf Hitler surrounded by swastikas on the whiteboard attached to his dorm room door. According to theProtected Identity Harm Reporting(PIHR website, there have now been six documented reports of antisemitic vandalism on our campus since the start of the academic year. As faculty members at Stanford dedicated to creating an environment where all students can learn and thrive, we are deeply unsettled by the prevalence of antisemitism on campus and concerned about the well-being of our Jewish students. Students targeted and harassed for their identity feel marginalized, distrustful and isolated from the campus community. We are disheartened that the victim of one recent antisemitic incident shared that his experience was “really making this living situation feel pretty hostile…” and that “it’s very unsettling thinking that he was in his room sleeping and someone was outside of his door doing this.” We cannot help but be concerned that this will irrevocably tar this student’s experience at our esteemed institution. We believe that it is the responsibility of Stanford University — including ourselves as scholars and educators — to foster a campus climate where all students feel welcome and included, free from bigotry, intimidation and harassment. Thus, we call on our university’s leadership, and our fellow faculty, to double down on confronting antisemitism at Stanford and creating the supportive learning environment that our Jewish students deserve. This will require a sustained effort to understand the scope of the problem, engage a broad array of stakeholders, and educate the campus community about the roots and consequences of one of the oldest and most widespread forms of hate. We stand ready to lend our academic expertise to this necessary task. In addition, many educational organizations, such as the Academic Engagement Network, in which we are members, and Hillel International, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee and others now have excellent resources, trainings, best practices and professional development opportunities and programs that we can utilize in our effort. Our institution, to its credit, has a track record of confronting antisemitism. This past fall, areportwas released detailing Stanford’s deliberate limitation of Jewish enrollment in the mid-twentieth century. President Tessier-Lavigne forthrightlyapologized“to the Jewish community, and to our entire university community, both for the actions documented in this report to suppress the admission of Jewish students in the 1950s and for the university’s denials of those actions in the period that followed,” and stated that “these actions were wrong. They were damaging. And they were unacknowledged for too long.” We hope this courageous work of self-reflection and education will continue in the wake of these most recent incidents of vandalism and harassment. In this spirit, we are proud to endorse the words of Stanford Hillel’s Rabbi Jessica Kirschner, as she exhorts: “Let us ensure that our campus is united by its own founding and current mottos: a place dedicated to truth and service, where the winds of freedom blow for all who are part of this ever-flourishing community.” Professor Danit ArielProfessor David CornfieldProfessor Larry DiamondProfessor Jeffrey GlennProfessor Judith GoldsteinProfessor Roger KornbergProfessor Jonathan LevavProfessor Ronald LevyProfessor Richard PoppProfessor Jeffrey UllmanProfessor Sam WineburgProfessor Adam de la Zarda Several of the authors are Stanford faculty who are members of the Academic Engagement Network, an educational nonprofit organization that works with nearly 900 faculty members on 300 campuses to counter antisemitism and the denigration of Jewish-Zionist identity while upholding academic freedom and freedom of expression.

rice_thresher_2023_27,"ByThresher Editorial Board9/27/23 10:24am In an email last week, Rice Prideannouncedan end to its partnership with Houston Hillel, a Jewish campus organization that has hosted events with Pride since 2016. The statement pointed to the “Standards of Partnership” of Hillel International, the parent group of Houston Hillel, which Pride called exclusionary to Palestinian and Arab queer students. Pride is right to discuss the needs of some of its most marginalized members. Palestinian and Arab queer students deserve to feel safe and welcomed in Pride. Pride was wrong, however, to so quickly end its partnership with Houston Hillel. It made this decision based on the values of Hillel International, with no clear grievances against activities at the Houston chapter. In fact, Pride did not attempt to have a discussion with Houston Hillel before its announcement. Pride claims to have spoken with student organizations such as Rice Students for Justice in Palestine and Judaism On Our Own Terms, but these are explicitly anti-Zionist groups that do not represent the wide spectrum of people who have a stake in this partnership — a particular point of worry given that Pride claims to represent the voices of all LGBTQ+ students on campus, whether they are pro-Israel or pro-Palestine. Most worrying is that Pride seemingly had little-to-no input from queer Jewish students at Rice; had the organization spoken with more Jewish people, it would not have made its announcement during theHigh Holy Days— especially the afternoon after Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year — and would have anticipated the attention this decision has received. Pride should have met with Houston Hillel to relay its concerns with Hillel International’s platform. Houston Hillel was the firstqueer-affirmingreligious group on campus and has hosted a dozen events with Pride about the challenging intersection between queerness and religion. Kenny Weiss, the executive director of Houston Hillel, has even said that the operations of Houston Hillel no longer align completely with the cited “Standards of Partnership” for Hillel International — information Pride could have taken into account if dialogue with Hillel was opened sooner, or even at all. Pride and Houston Hillel could have tried to work together to devise ways to make all members feel included. The importance of an accepting and established space for studying and celebrating religion and queerness cannot be understated. We also believe Pride should have encouraged more dialogue within the organization before making this decision. Many queer Jewish students felt blindsided, and rightfully so: A choice this complex should not be made exclusively by the leadership of a student affinity group. The very nature of intersectionality necessitates a wide discussion among people who hold different identities. More broadly, this announcement brings into focus the way affinity organizations on campus make decisions regarding the diverse and intersectional identities of their members. These are incredibly complicated questions covering queerness, race, religion, violence, legacies of colonization and more. No affinity group executive board is prepared to fairly and wholly answer these questions — and none should try. Because this issue is not black-and-white, Pride’s decision to cut ties with Houston Hillel should not have been either. To carve out a space that is welcoming to queer Jewish, Arab, Palestinian and other members, Rice Pride should have fostered dialogue and worked to build a solution for all. While the political and historical events that have shaped our identities may be beyond our control, the civil and all-encompassing discourse necessary to make difficult decisions is not.

crimson_2023_28,"The publication of thejoint statement by Harvard Palestine solidarity groups, theopen letter to the Harvard communitysigned by several hundred Harvard faculty and scholars, and theop-ed in The Crimsonby our colleagues Melani Cammett, Ryan D. Enos, and Steven Levitsky offer us an opportunity to clarify our commitment to academic freedom. The common saying that “ideas have consequences” can be abused to justify censoring or punishing people for expressing their opinions — abuse we vehemently oppose. We agree with Cammett, Enos, and Levitsky that the students who issued the joint statement have every right to express their opinions, free of censorship, threats, intimidation, punishment, or having their private information exposed. If anyone at Harvard has breached the students’ academic freedom in any of these ways, we’d be the first to urge the University, and the newCouncil on Academic Freedom at Harvard, to take a stand against it. (The two of us are among the six co-presidents of the council, as well as the six co-authors of the open letter, but the opinions expressed here are solely our own. At the same time, expressing ideas has the legitimate consequence that those ideas may be criticized, sometimes harshly. This would be true in any circumstance, but it is especially appropriate now. By any standards, the joint statement is extraordinary. It blames the murder of more than a thousand civilians, includingchildren and the elderly, “entirely” on the victims’ own country’s government. In doing so, it shows ignorance of the widely accepted principle that noncombatants may not be targeted in war, regardless of one’s opinion of the righteousness of the cause. And it simplistically blames a tragic situation with a deep and complex history on a single villain, absolving all other parties: from the men whopulled the triggers,raped the women, andset houses on firewith families in them, to the ideology and tactics of Hamas, the role of Egypt in the blockade of Gaza, andIran’s supportin training and arming Hamas militants. It is entirely legitimate under the principles of free speech to push back hard against the content of this statement. Perhaps, as Cammett, Enos, and Levitsky suggest, some of the signatories thought they were merely advocating “a deeper discussion of the roots of Israeli-Palestinian violence.” But if so, they should recognize that blaming one party for all that occurred is a poor way to begin such a discussion. Cammett, Enos, and Levitsky propose recognizing “the context of decades of dehumanizing occupation,” but this context cannot possibly excuse the perpetrators of atrocious war crimes. It’s all the more legitimate to rebut this statement vociferously given the damage it has done to Harvard and its students. When 34 student organizations, many using “Harvard” in their names, sign onto an inflammatory public statement, it will inevitably taint the entire University (even after some have withdrawn their signatures . We have seen many headlines like “Harvard’s Horror: The statement from student groups blaming Israel for the Hamas attacks will further erode the university’s stature, and deservedly so.” Worse, many of the Harvard students who belong to these clubs found themselves pinned to a statement that they themselves never approved and indeed found abhorrent. Under these circumstances, it is completely appropriate for members of the community to articulate their beliefs by distancing themselves from this statement in the strongest of terms. Doing so is not “bullying” — though that can happen and must be criticized when it occurs — but rather is treating the students as full members of an intellectual community who, like all others, are responsible for the content of their public statements. Yes, the principle of academic freedom gives all members of our community the right to express their opinions without censorship, intimidation, or punishment. It also gives other members of the community the right to rebut those opinions and to draw inferences about the judgment of those expressing them. We look forward to the day when issues such as this, despite being contentious and emotional, are the subject of respectful and productive engagement among members of the Harvard community. Jeffrey S. Flier is the Higginson Professor of Physiology and Medicine. Steven A. Pinker is the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology. Both are co-presidents of the Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard and co-authors of the open letter to the Harvard community."
crimson_2023_53,"My first interaction with the “manosphere” was a long time ago. As a child of the internet age, I was introduced to anti-feminist ideas way too young. Like a lot of young boys, I went through a period of one or two years tacitly endorsing these ideas, because I liked the loud personalities of their proponents. Looking back, I’m not sure I actually believed them, but I consumed this content nonetheless. But as I got a bit older, and made female friends, my opinion shifted. I was utterly turned off by Donald Trump in 2016, ending my brief flirtation with misogyny. It was thus with a bit of levity that I dismissed the misogynistic content creators that started to flood social media a year or two ago. They were, in my mind, just loud personalities that boys would reject once they, you know, started talking to women. So I was a bit horrified when I realized the staying power of people like Andrew Tate and Sneako. They didn’t go away in a week, like I thought they would. They were popular with not just preteens, but with fully grown men. And they made me realize that we’re dealing with a serious societal problem of male resentment. Men hold the majority of power within society. But there are many ways in which men are left behind, hurt by the patriarchy that usually props them up. Men are less likely to seek help for both physical and mental health problems, and this lack of preventative care has impacts down the road: Men make up nearly 80 percent of all suicides in America. And just as women are often reduced to mothers or girlfriends, men are often reduced to their careers, and made to feel like failures if they cannot be successful breadwinners. Perhaps the most insidious effect the patriarchy has on men is promoting the dehumanization of women. Now that women are beginning to occupy traditionally male spaces, men are forced to acknowledge their talents, their ability, their humanity. Men have given up a bit of privilege, and that can often cause resentment. This resentment has, in recent years, combined itself with another related problem pertaining to men’s perceptions of masculinity. In thewords of journalistCaitlin Moran, “Feminism has a stated objective, which is the political, social, sexual and economic equality of women. With men, there isn’t an objective or an aim.” Unlike women entering male-dominated careers, men often refuse to enter traditionally female spaces, because those jobs are paid less and generally carry less prestige. To purportedly fight back, influencers encourage men to see women as distinctly different from themselves. These influencers make up the “manosphere,” and they have, at times, called for the end of no-fault divorce and the end of women’s suffrage, among other things. Undoubtedly the movement’s figurehead is Andrew Tate, a former kickboxing world champion who is currently on trial in Romania for rape, sex trafficking, and organized crime. Tate preaches a rhetoric that has been described as “extreme male gospel.” He says that men should have “authority” over women like they do over children and dogs. He talks endlessly about “The Matrix,” an amalgamation of legitimate societal problems like wage slavery with attacks on feminism. And he has a huge audience: He’s become one of the most popular influencers in the world, with his name being searched on TikTok a staggering 22 billion times as of the end of 2022. This problem is a rot. It has its roots throughout American society, and it will take generations of intentional effort to fix. One part of the solution lies in education. Recently, we’ve seen women begin to outnumber men in higher education. However, in focusing on college, we are ignoring a more fundamental problem: Our educational system is disproportionately failing young boys. According to a2021 studyby the Brookings Institute, young men in America graduate high school at a meaningfully lower rate than young women. It has also been consistently shown that women, on average, achieve more success than men during K-12 education. And, perhaps most importantly, there are far too few men working as teachers, often leaving boys without male role models outside their homes. Education is critically important. It is not, as Tate argues, “insidious propaganda” that will turn you into a “slave.” It will make you a better-educated and more well-rounded member of society. But we need to make sure that boys believe this. Harvard, specifically, should be strongly encouraging more students — especially more male students — to pursue the Education Studies secondary field. Instead, in recent years, Harvard has shut down many opportunities for students to pursue education as a career. They must reverse course fast, investing both in the Ed secondary and related endeavors, such as programs that encourage students to go into teaching. I worry about the world that kids around me are being born into. I worry about the world that I, later in my life, might bring kids into. The position of men is not just a men’s issue, just as feminism is not just a women’s issue. And education serves as the foundation upon which change is built. It’s time Harvard invested in it.

Independence from Stanford was a scary proposition in 1973 from a financial perspective. There was no big brother to bail us out. So, in 1975, we began hosting dinners around the Big Game. We would contract with restaurants in North Beach for Cal away Big Games and at the Faculty Club for home games. Two groups dominated the attendance: the first consisted of alumni from the 1970s, while the second was a group from the 1950s and 1960s, spearheaded by Harry Press ’39, longtime editor of the Stanford Magazine, and his good friend Lorry Lokey ’49. The thought was that a safety net was needed for an independent Daily at some point in the future. It became obvious that the Daily was the most formative part of the Stanford experience for these alumni. The numbers grew from 30 per year coming to the dinner to as many as 150 in recent years. Friendships and professional collaborations grew across the decades from 1945 to 1980. The need for a financial safety net and a new building became obvious in the late 1980s and the Friends of The Stanford Daily was formed in 1991. Press, Elna Tymes ’61 and I embarked on a 14-year struggle to secure Stanford approval for a new site for the Daily, as the University was going to tear down the old Daily building to make way for the Engineering building. Lorry Lokey became the lead donor, and with the help of his challenge grants, Daily alumni came up with the funds for the new Lorry Lokey Building on Panama Mall. Over the years journalists, primarily from the 1950s, established small endowments to fund summer internships for current Daily staff. Christy Wise ’75 began and managed an effort that has led to over 100 summer internship opportunities with newspapers such as The San Jose Mercury and the Washington Post. Over the years, older Daily alumni have provided guidance, education and collaborations with younger Daily alumni. Alumni at large Daily metro papers and national magazines have provided many workshops to current Daily staff. In 1973, we did not know what an independent Daily would face in the future. The oil recession of 1973 to 1975 hit immediately. There were small recessions in the early 1980s and 1990s. The dot com collapse of 2000 hit the paper hard, followed by the 2008 housing bubble recession. The shift away from printed papers and the departure of 90% of revenue from print advertising has been especially difficult. The Friends of the Stanford Daily has provided financial help to the Daily several times since 1991 and to date has largely accomplished its goal: to allow The Stanford Daily to remain independent and provide journalistic education and career opportunities to hundreds of Stanford students. What began as a social lark around Big Game has grown into an effective support organization. Most importantly, it has provided a forum where Stanford alumni some 20 to 40 years apart in age, can gather and exchange memories and wisdom from their student years. The organization has proven to be a critical resource in accomplishing its primary goal, to keep the Daily independent over the last 50 years, and hopefully for 50 years into the future. Charlie Hoffman ’73 MBA ’76 was a member of The Stanford Daily during his time at Stanford and has supported efforts for Daily independence.

crimson_2023_117,"A year ago, Harvard authorized double concentrations for the first time. The move was a welcome increase in academic flexibility, allowing students to pursue multiple interests simultaneously without the more complicated requirements of joint concentrations. Theintroduction of double concentrationsalso means that students can spend a lot more of their class time just meeting requirements. With most concentrations requiring 10 to 14 credits, a double concentrator can now fill up more than two thirds of their 32 total class slots with requirements. A highly ambitious student can even try to rack up two concentrations, one secondary, and a language citation. Double concentrations and language citations seem to represent a choice by Harvard to permit students to take on a lot more structure in their course load than the basic requirement of one concentration, if they choose to do so. Nevertheless, the administration remains unwilling to permit one particular type of course-load structure: multiple secondary fields. This incongruity exists despite the fact that concentration requirements are not only more numerous than a secondary’s four to six courses, but they usually also involve more difficult requirements than a secondary. In simple terms, Harvard allows students to be experts in two subjects and dabble in another, but not to be experts in one and dabble in two. In one fell swoop, Harvard has both added flexibility to its curricular requirements and created a glaring inconsistency. As far as I can tell, it is not clear why Harvard has failed to create double secondaries — whether it is an oversight or a deliberate feature of curricular design. Double secondaries would likely be quite popular. More than 50 percent of students currently complete a secondary field, and because most require few courses, many students likely already complete the requirements for multiple secondaries but have to arbitrarily choose one to be officially awarded. Perhaps administrative higher-ups determined that double secondaries would be too popular or easy to get and are thus less deserving of recognition than double concentrations. Indeed, one could argue that students who already have one secondary would be better off choosing their remaining classes without seeking to satisfy additional requirements. This view would be hard to reconcile with permitting double concentrations, but perhaps administrators perceive that an additional concentration requires so much effort that only the truly passionate will pursue them. By contrast, double secondaries would be too easy to obtain for students with merely a casual interest or a desire to improve their resumé. However, those arguments are unconvincing. For starters, because they require so many additional courses, double concentrations are much more restrictive of course choice than double secondaries. As for academic rigor, it is not necessarily easier to be competent in three subjects (demonstrated by a concentration and two secondaries than to have deep competence in only two: their relative difficulties will vary from person to person. Harvard should thus extend its good sense in allowing double concentrations to the realm of secondary fields. The most coherent option would be to allow up to three secondary fields, at least for single concentrators, since three secondaries’ requirements would add up to roughly as much as a second concentration. What, then, will become of students’ unstructured exploration of different academic subjects? I think it will live on. First, many students choose to come to Harvard in part because it offers the option to take varied classes outside of structured requirements. There is no reason to believe that they will stop doing so simply because they would have additional structured options. Second, it is precisely because students already engage in this sort of exploration, pursuing various disciplines without worrying about recognition on their degree, that many likely already meet the requirements for several secondaries. Allowing multiple secondaries would only give official acknowledgement to this exploration. Ultimately, the introduction of double concentrations, despite the inconsistency that I’ve highlighted, is a good thing for students. But Harvard mustn’t stop at concentrations when prioritizing flexibility in student requirements. It’s time to take the next logical step in ensuring that students can design the best academic plan for themselves. It’s time to permit multiple secondaries. Lucas R. Szwarcberg ’23, a Crimson Editorial comper, is an Applied Mathematics concentrator in Currier House."
ubyssey_2023_17,"May 17, 2023 Written byKatherine FengandKareem Hassib The Senate meets monthly to discuss and vote on UBC academic matters. But, Senate can often be hard to understand for the average student and theagenda docketcan be super long and dull to read. Senate Recentred is written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month. Here’s what to expect at the May 17 Senate meeting. 2020-2023 Triennial review report The Senate operates in cycles of three years, also known as trienniums. As the current triennium and year draw to a conclusion with the final Senate meeting this week, many committees are poised to present their annual reports. In addition to providing an update to all senators on full Senate proceedings, these reports help ensure committees are held accountable for fulfilling their mandates. Created with guidance from senators, senate committees, and members of the UBC community, the Triennial Review is a document that outlines recommendations which may guide future changes to the Senate. Some key recommendations in this cycle’s report include revising orientation and training for new senators as well as making adjustments to committee mandates and composition. The report also recommends an external review of the Senate, which would entail hiring a firm external to UBC to assess the Senate’s procedures and organization. Approval of new academic programs and courses A joint report of the Admissions and Curriculum Committees is proposing four new programs for approval by the Senate. These new programs are: In addition to new courses in several faculties, the Curriculum Committee is proposing the introduction of a new major program to accompany the existing honours program in Cellular, Anatomical, and Physiological Sciences. The committee is also recommending the removal of the accelerated 16-month option for the Master of Public Policy and Global Affairs. Changes in sight for Dean’s Honour in Applied Science and Forestry The Academic Policy Committee is putting forward changes to the academic distinctions granted in the Faculty of Applied Science and the Faculty of Forestry, with the proposal renaming Dean’s Honour to Dean’s List and adding a Dean’s Scholar designation for students achieving averages above 90 per cent. Student appeals on academic discipline report When the President’s Academic Misconduct Committee finds that students committed academic misconduct, students have the option to appeal the decision, which is then considered by this Senate committee. Out of four appeals heard this year, three were dismissed and one allowed in part. Two are currently in progress.

state_press_2023_28,"The Phoenix Suns traded two of their beloved players, Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson, for Brooklyn Nets player, Kevin Durant, in a bittersweet exchange. Kevin Durant s arrival in Phoenix was a bittersweet moment for Suns fans, as the team also traded away its beloved twins, Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson. Phoenix should not have traded away two of its best and most beloved players in order to improve its shot at the NBA Finals. But, the Suns madethe moveanyway. Away go the twins (along with multiple first-round NBA Draft picks and in comes… Durant, the two-time NBA Finals MVP and perennial NBA All-Star. Obviously, Durant is a great player, but it s clearly not as simple as that. The Suns left behind two of their best and most-liked players for Durant, and to some of the team s fanbase, the price was steep. Durant was, notably, once labeled as a snake because of his willingness to leave behind the Oklahoma City Thunder for the Golden State Warriors… after the Warriors beat the Thunder in the playoffs the previous season. He also hasa lengthy injury history,including an Achilles tendon tear that led him to miss the 2019-2020 season and an MCL sprain in the 2021-2022 season that sat him out for six weeks. At the age of 34, those injuries add up. I think the Nets won more of it (the trade . The trade is an all-or-nothing trade to win the championship this year, said Aaron Zhou, a freshman studying accounting and Suns fan. But I don t think it s worth that much for just Durant, especially when he is 34 years old. Further than just the details of the trade and Durant s abilities, the twins meant a lot to the Phoenix sports community. The Arizona Diamondbacks went so far as to have aMikal Bridges appreciation day, which, of course, Cam Johnson tagged along for. Phoenix Suns Cam Johnson and Cam Payne tagging along for Mikal Bridges appreciation day at Chase Field on his birthday. These guys are characters. You love to see it.#AllAZ|#Dbackspic.twitter.com/AQi3rWdWLw It is also worth mentioning that the Suns already had an excellent shot to win a championship, especially given that they went to the finals without Durant in 2021. Yet, no matter the case, teams are willing to do anything to try to (theoretically increase their odds at a championship. It s a sad reality. But, maybe it shouldn t be a reality in the NBA. There s nothing wrong with a star player moving around once or twice in their career, but moving around three, four or five times in the chase for a championship isn t necessary. If NBA players had more incentives to stay with the team they already signed on with, we would see more storybook endings, such as Lebron James famous finals win over the Golden State Warriors for his home state s team.It s possible that Bridges and Johnson could have eventually had a similar moment with the Suns. Durant, for as good as he is, doesn t have that same kind of commitment to the Suns, and a finals win led by Durant would not feel like a perfect fairytale story. This rift is sad in comparison to college basketball, where former ASU guard and current Philadelphia 76ers player, James Harden visited Desert Financial Arena for an ASU men s basketballhome loss to Colorado. He did this when the team was in a bit of a slump, too. A deeper fan-attached culture of loyalty in the NBA could have stopped the Suns trade for Durant from happening. It s a shame that the Suns decided to trade two of their best up-and-coming fan favorites for an aging and occasionally injured all-star to theoretically improve their odds of winning the finals. Loyalty to the fans and their experience should take priority over desperately chasing a championship (especially when the team is already good . It s what makes the college basketball experience more valuable, and, ultimately, it would do the same for the NBA. Edited by Kate Duffy, Reagan Priest and Anusha Natarajan.

stanforddaily_2023_73,"What group of people is best positioned to advise a new school of sustainability? On June 5th, we got Stanford administration’s answer. The Doerr School’s Dean announced the school’sAdvisory Council’snew membership. The Council now counts 22 members, over half of whom are either billionaires or their spouses, and half of whom are executives at large corporations or investment firms. Five of the new council members are researchers, and only three of these researchers have expertise in environment, energy or sustainability. The sole student is a brilliant and thoughtful individual whom I hope will be listened to. The Council includes no community organizers, activists, government officials or representatives from Africa. The Doerr School seeks to address climate change — what former World Bank Economist Nicholas Sterncalled“the greatest and most wide-ranging market failure ever seen.” It is far from obvious that businessmen, financiers and philanthropists steeped in market thinking are best qualified to advise a school of sustainability. But this goes beyond a mismatch of skills. The Council counts among its members a titan of high-tech who made his billionsmonopolistically stifling competitionand who recentlypurchased a stakein the world’s largest private jet services company, the managing director of abank deeply invested in fossil fuel expansion, and the president of a thinktank notable for employing acadre of climatedeniers, to name a few easy examples. Stanford administration’s confusion of accumulated wealth for leadership and fame for wisdom is certainly true to form — after all, what else would you expect from aschool foundedby a notorious robber baron and led for decades by prominent eugenicists? More recently, Stanford dropout Elizabeth Holmes similarly substituted power and money for domain knowledge to form the board ofTheranos. Still, in 2023, Stanford and the Doerr School clinging to the same fallacious logic disappoints. It is shockingly credulous to allow those who have financed or supported oil wars, anti-competitive rents and science denial to advise us on how to solve many of the problems they exacerbated. As Anand Giridharadas points out in his bookWinners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World, it is like assuming that “arsonists make the best firefighters.” Moreover, the vast majority of the Council’s members provide an extraordinarily narrow perspective of shelter and privilege. They will likely experience climate change, an existential threat for billions, as nothing more than an inconvenience. This is fundamentally anti-democratic. Inthe words ofCongresswoman Ayanna Pressley, to make good decisions about an existential threat, “those closest to the pain should be closest to the power.” If we want to solve climate change equitably, we need decision-makers with truly diverse perspectives who have a stake in the solution. Diversity is both just and pragmatic: Stanford’sown researchhas shown that diverse perspectives lead to the best climate adaptation strategies. What do we students do with our intransigent school? Do we put our head down, get our degree and move on to do good in the world? That is certainly one approach. But I think Stanford is too prestigious and wields too much influence to be given up on. And change is possible. This year alone, the Stanford community has already successfully pressured the Doerr School to launch anenvironmental justice centerand toreconsiderits fossil fuel funding. To steer the Doerr School towards true sustainability, we can establish a Council where more young people, people from low-lying island nations who are already forced to abandon their ancestral lands, people who have experienced environmental racism, and people whose livelihoods are dependent on a just energy transition hold the highest advisory roles. In our time here, we have the power to push Stanford ever so slightly towards justice, towards community, and towards sustainability.

ubyssey_2023_40,"March 3, 2023 Written byUbyssey Editorial Board This article contains discussion of transphobia. The February 13 AMS Council meeting demonstrated the AMS’s disregard for the health and wellbeing of Trans students and a failure to live up to itsequitycommitments. Councilvotedto put two separate referendum items in this year’s AMS Elections ballot — one for a general $52.50 fee increase to maintain the current level of coverage and a separate $8 fee increase to add gender-affirming care coverage to the plan that is conditional on the first increase passing. Councillors voted to separate the two items despite the Trans Coalition s specific request to combine them. The Trans Coalition is a group of students advocating for gender-affirming care on campus. Coalition speakers said the separate vote on gender-affirming care places extra scrutiny on their community. This visibility increases Trans students’ risk ofharassmentbecause extra attention toward Trans people often leads to discrimination. The current health care plan isnot sustainablewith the present fee, but the plan also does not include comprehensive gender-affirming health care, creating a financial barrier to accessing life-saving care for many Trans students. Trans students said separating the two referendum items — and making the item on gender-affirming care conditional on the general fee item passing — implies they should be treated differently than cisgender students by the AMS. Some councillors said the two referendum items should be separate because they were asking different things, with one pertaining to a fee increase and the other to adding new coverage. This technicality allowed Council to choose to vote against the wellbeing of Trans students who asked for a single referendum out of visibility and equity concerns. This addition is not merely an expansion of care, but rather an opportunity to fix an oversight in the Health & Dental Plan since the care Trans students need is not already available to them. Past changes in coverage to the Health & Dental Plan — like themental healthcoverageincreases — have been passed internally. AMS executives said they can’t make these changes internally right now due to the poor financial health of the Health & Dental Reserve Fund, but rejecting the simple request to combine these two referenda others Trans students. This blatant disregard for the wellbeing of Trans students goes against the AMSEquity Action Plan, which commits to building stronger anti-discriminatory relationships with the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. One of the actions under goal seven in the Outreach, Advocacy + Communication section of the Equity Action Plan states, “Do not burden individuals from historically, persistently, and systematically marginalized communities … with the responsibility to speak for their entire community or to educate others on justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion issues.” In an effort to appeal to councillors, several Trans Coalition members at the meeting shared their experiences of transphobic harassment and facing barriers to gender-affirming care at UBC and elsewhere. Why did marginalized students need to disclose traumatic anecdotes to convince councillors of the harassment they face? This reveals a failure in how Council handles conversations around the trauma of equity-seeking and marginalized groups. Besides the failure to adhere to the Equity Action Plan and inconsistencies regarding when and why changes to the Health & Dental Plan should be brought to a student vote, Council also displayed a lack of empathy toward the Coalition. Many councillors pushed back against the group, placing their own views of what Trans students needed above those of the Trans activists in the room. Some councillors even insinuated cis students shouldn’t have to pay for Trans students’ health care — an argument that misses the point of a comprehensive health care plan that all students pay into regardless of whether individual students use all of the available benefits. Some councillors also argued adding gender-affirming care to the general fee increase referendum item might cause the proposed fee increase to fail, putting the health care of all students at risk due to the AMS s inability to sustain the plan without a fee increase. But at the same time, Council said they believed the two referendum items would pass individually. These arguments contradict each other. If the AMS believed students would support gender-affirming care as a single item, why wouldn’t they support it while nested within the broader fee increase? While a few councillors spoke in support of the Trans Coalition, most other councillors either pushed back against the Coalition or remained silent. Council also went into a private, in-camera session for the last 40 minutes of the discussion on whether to combine the referenda, meaning all non-voting members, including the Trans Coalition andThe Ubyssey, were kicked out of the room. After the in-camera session, Council voted 16–4 against combining the referenda. We can’t know what was discussed during this session, which raises concerns about transparency. Councillors should be required to publicly share their stances on issues that directly affect students who elected them. When voting in AMS Elections next week, you’ll see two separate referendum items on the ballot. And although this decision is disappointing, know that students advocated for the wellbeing of the UBC Trans community when the AMS wouldn’t.

crimson_2023_140,"When Anne was growing up in New York City, her mother would sometimes reminisce about a radio drama show she remembered from her own childhood called “Grand Central Station.” Each week, the show began with an announcer describing the massive train station as a “crossroad” of innumerable private lives, “a gigantic stage on which a thousand dramas play out daily.” Since we became Faculty Deans a decade ago, and began each year to share our daily lives with hundreds of students, we have learned to think about Harvard undergraduate life as being a little like this. These years have been a profoundly meaningful journey for us. We have eaten with students, sat in quiet companionship with them, hosted them, played with them, advised them, laughed with them, and, on occasion — thankfully, more rarely — weathered struggles, uncertainties, and even tears with them. But perhaps most of all, the years of living in community with students has helped us to appreciate them as people with complex private stories that had previously been mostly invisible to us, back when we were ‘just’ a professor and a museum director. Some students worked long hours at campus jobs, not just to help pay for their own needs or social activities, but because their parents expected them to send money back home to help with living expenses. Some stayed up most of the night to comfort a distraught friend, but still managed to make it to their organic chemistry lecture. Some came out to their parents, only to find they were no longer welcome at home for Thanksgiving. There were always new stories: the student who grew up in a refugee camp; the student who looked after the mental well-being of struggling younger siblings in high school because parents, for whatever reason, could not; the student who was the primary English-language translator for their family, even after arriving on campus. At Commencement, we tend to spend a lot of time celebrating the many visible triumphs of our students: the prizes and scholarships; the Phi Beta Kappa honors; the championship varsity games; the prestigious or incredibly cool jobs; the internships; the great medical, law, or graduate schools. We don’t generally stop to think about the many students who blend into the sea of gowns, but for whom simply arriving at this point is the hardest and most important thing they have ever achieved. Their Harvard experience may not have been primarily about landing that great job or winning that plum prize (though some achieve that too . It may have been primarily about something else that we don’t generally give prizes for: resilience, showing up, giving back, grace, grit, compassion, and perseverance.This, therefore, is an essay of appreciation for all of these students. Students whose time here has been defined by milestones that they may never share with their professors or future employers, and that may never end up in their letters of recommendation. The ones who did not maintain a perfect GPA, but who were there for that friend all night, or showed up for their families in the midst of finals week. The ones who arrived on campus burdened with sometimes difficult stories, but who then also came to realize that they didn’t have to be wholly defined by those stories — that they had the ability to become authors of new stories, stories of their own. And here’s a thought: Maybe these kinds of students offer all of us a different kind of metric of success — one that measures the distance run and the promises kept, and not just the tributes won and the public acclaim received. Maybe the most interesting question we can ask friends as they prepare to depart is not, “What was your concentration?” Or, “What are you doing next?” But, “What’s your story?” “What was your story when you arrived, what did it become, and what is it now?” Some stories are gifts, easily told and publicly celebrated. But others are hard-earned accomplishments, marked by twists and turns that fewer people will ever hear about. This Commencement, as we look out with affection at the final senior class we will help graduate, we will be thinking about these quieter stories, these less frequently told stories, and feeling a special sense of pride.

crimson_2023_12,"Through all the ups and downs of my two years at Harvard, from Housing Day to the Harvard-Yale Game, one constant has persisted in the background. A small, usually brown animal, scurrying along across the street, or flattened unceremoniously on the road. An animal glorified in Ratatouille and studied in labs across our campus. If you haven’t caught on by now: Yes, I am writing about rats. In my most recent encounter, just a month ago, I jumped on my swivel chair as I viewed the engorged body of a rat in its attempt to enter my well-warmed bathroom. My screams resulted in the rat running back to its hiding place: my closet. My scream became a cacophony when my roommate realized what I saw, and we immediately called Yard Operations in our panicked consternation. When we told them about the problem, they started to laugh, assuring us that someone would arrive at our dorm in five minutes. While I appreciated their responsiveness, I was confused about why they were not similarly disgusted. Upon arrival, our Yard Ops representative was similarly confused, because he assumed it was our neighbors who had called — apparently, they also had a rat situation. He told us that rats had been slowly working their way up the dorm, reaching the third floor, a level above our own. As I attempted to fall asleep in a room I was actively scared to stay in, with my desk lamp firmly on, I wondered how we got into this situation, and what I had done to attract these obnoxious rodents. Cambridge is not alone in facing a rat problem; many of the surrounding residential areas are also battling an influx of rats exacerbated by the pandemic. Experts speculate that the growing suburban population, milder winters, and pandemic closures of high-producing trash areas like restaurants mean that the local rats have turned their wandering noses toward residential areas. This development has led to Cambridge creating a position ofrat liaison, to serve as a point of contact between the public and Cambridge City Council for all rat-related complaints and information. All I could think about, as I tried to fall asleep that terrifying night, is why we need a specialized rat liaison — not just the multipurpose tool of Yard Ops — here at Harvard. More than asassy guide, we need a compassionate, human individual to guide us in our legitimate rat-inspired plight. Although the proper methods to handle animal infestations might be obvious to students who come from New York City or rural areas, that isn’t true for everyone, making dorm-wide coordination difficult. At home in Arizona, although we haveroof rats, my family easily controls our indoor rodent population because we inhabit every room in our house, leaving no crevice for stray rodents. In a community of people with different habits of food storage and trash removal like Harvard’s undergraduate dorms, it is much harder to stop the invasion. A rat liaison could help to coordinate connecting living areas and inform each inhabitant about practices to decrease the rat population. In my own Russell Hall, if we were able to end the infestation on the first floor, or at least stop the rodents from traveling upwards, then my neighbors and I on the second floor need not have experienced this calamity. Another aspect in which a rat liaison could be helpful is providing a guide for living with such undesired roommates if preventative efforts are unsuccessful; I know I would have appreciated a crash course in how to live with rats. The week before the break, when I had to deal with the rats, I slept with most of my head covered, scared that I would wake up to a furry face close to my own. My sleep was rocky, culminating with a dream in which the Transportation Security Administration detained me for transporting animals domestically because they found a dorm rat in my luggage. I know this sounds ridiculous, but it’s ridiculous to have to coexist with an extra roommate that does not pay rent. Rodents such as rats can carry diseases like hantavirus, rat bite fever, or lymphocytic choriomeningitis, which are all transmittable to humans. During finals week, it would have been nice to have a good night’s rest and be able to turn my lamp off, or even just to have someone at which to vent about infestations. If my life imitated art, this would be the point where I have a change of heart. I would let go of my disgust and fear of the rat living in my dorm. Slowly we would become friends, and my dorm rat would inform me that they are cousins with Remy from Ratatouille. They would turn out to be a pastry chef and produce culinary delights, and slowly my rat would replace Harvard University Dining Service with a Pâtisserie. But unfortunately, my life does not imitate this particular arc of Ratatouille. While my current dorm in Adams House will be renovated soon, I know my troubles will not end here. With a liaison, I could dream of pastries instead of rats — once I slow down my heart to an acceptable pace. Merlin A.

stanforddaily_2023_65,"Content warning: This article contains references to violence and sexual assault. The killing of civilians is never justified, whether by Israel or Hamas. Theopinionpenned in The Stanford Daily by Stanford Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP on the current Israel-Palestine conflict is vile and despicable. As the great Martin Luther King Jr. intoned in his Nobel speech, “v iolence as a way of achieving racial justice is both impractical and immoral … It solves no social problem: it merely creates new and more complicated ones. Violence is impractical because it is a descending spiral ending in destruction for all. It is immoral because it seeks to humiliate the opponent rather than win his understanding: it seeks to annihilate rather than convert. Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than love. It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible.” While I take deep issue with the treatment of the people of the Gaza Strip over these past decades and staunchly supported their cause many years before that position was “trendy,” there is no justification for Hamas’s terrorism. Hamas hasmassacredJewish men,defiled and rapedJewish women — parading their bodies in front of jeering crowds — andlittered the streetswith the bodies of Jewish children. In Article Seven of their1988 charterHamas wrote, “t he Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews , when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.” Hamas’s dream is not to expel Israel from the Gaza Strip, nor even to exterminate Israel as a nation. Their dream is the extermination of the Jewish people. There were many Israelis who advocated for the lifting of the Gaza blockade. How many of them did Hamas murder? While the Israel Defense Forces have, at times, committed grave injustices against the people of the Gaza Strip, there is no equivalence here. SJP excuses child murder, rape and terrorism as freedom-fighting. The SJP’s article draws a false parallel with Ukrainian soldiers who are bravely fighting to protect their country from autocracy — perhaps SJP believes Russia’s propaganda about the Azov Brigade but takes no affront. SJP paints Israelis as colonialists, ignoring that the Jewish people have suffered persecution and genocides for thousands of years, ignoring that Israel is a nation besieged by antisemitic powers. Hamas is funded by Iran via Hezbollah and by the Gulf States. Finally, let us not forget the treatment of women by Hamas. SJP, under a faux shroud of progressivism, defends a group which, in 2021,determinedthat women should not be allowed to travel freely without the permission of a male guardian. That SJP would call upon the Stanford community to “educate themselves” is frankly insulting given that their article reflects a lack of compassion and a poor understanding of history. To understand the current conflict, one must understand that Hamas does not recognize Israel’s right to exist, as theyreaffirmedin 2017. Hamas rejects the notion of any long-term, peaceful solution. While Israel bears some responsibility for the failure of long-term negotiations, Hamas has, at numerous times, incinerated peaceful dialogue. For instance, in 2003 Hamasended a cease-firewith the suicide bombing of a bus in Jerusalem. That students at this university could be so thoughtless and base as to defend terrorism, sitting safely in their dorm rooms and living privileged lives, speaks poorly of American society and of social studies departments, which have evidently equipped students with the language to discuss colonialism, but a paucity of understanding. An anecdote: tucked away under my mother’s desk is an old box of family photos, passed down to us by my great grandmother. A group of wonderful people sit in that box, people my mother was robbed of the opportunity to know by the Nazis and the German concentration camps where they died torturous deaths. Most of their stories my great grandmother took to her grave. It was too painful to talk about them. I urge the members of SJP to reconsider their position and not, led astray by good intentions, to don the attitudes of Nazis and terrorists. I would rather welcome them as brothers and sisters. Benjamin Driscoll is a Ph.D. student in the computer science department at Stanford University. This article was updated on the request of the author to clarify that their position is that Hamas, not SJP, rejects the notion of any long-term, peaceful solution.

crimson_2023_156,"On the morning train between Harvard Station and Central Station, I pull out my phone and glance at the stopwatch. Twenty four minutes and 19 seconds. I slump against my seat. It’s the 97th straight morning with this slow zone. Over the summer, I timed my commute on the Red Line from Alewife Station to Park Street Station, inspired by therecent revamp of a dashboardby TransitMatters, a Massachusetts organization tracking the (un reliability of the MBTA and advocating for improvement. Last year, I wrote aboutour transportation crisis, arguing that car-dependent infrastructure and urban sprawl impede our shiftfrom motocracytoward a sustainable future. I alsojoined the effortto address these issues by organizing formobility justice, a new framework for providing equal access to movement for people of all backgrounds and abilities. In service of my advocacy, I often document what I see wrong with our current system in my daily life. On bus and train commutes, bike rides, and walking trips, I take note of movement and space, paying particular attention to those most affected by the problems plaguing our transportation. What I see startles me. In the heart of Boston’s daily commute is a frustratingly sluggish, unreliable transit system, underscoring the need to prioritize sustainable, accessible improvement. When I moved to Massachusetts two years ago, I went from having never used public transportation — the way to traverse Myrtle Beach, S.C., isby golf cart— to knowing exactly which bus route to take to access my favorite restaurants (the 86 bus gets you a five-minute walk from the doorstep of Himalayan Kitchen in Somerville . Today, I proudly count myself among the over 750,000 people who rely on the MBTA. We are aregion that needs transit. Why don’t we treat it that way? The MBTA is suffering from a severe safety and operations crisis. Distressing headlines regularly fill the pages of the Boston Globe: “Add 20 minutes to your commute each way.” “More and more T workers are leaving.” “Green Line train derailed at Packard’s Corner.” Earlier this year,the MBTA was placed under reviewby the Federal Transit Administration for safety issues. In response, the T added slow zones, which have increased travel times on the Red Lineby over 80 minutesat its worst. Google Maps estimates it should take around 25 minutes to get downtown from Alewife Station to Park Street Station on the Red Line. In practice, the only certainty of taking the T is the uncertainty of the commute time. My frustration peaks in the slow zone between Harvard Station and Central Station, where the train’s speedslows to 10 miles per hour. Occasionally, an unwitting rider scans the train car and wonders audibly, “Why aren’t we going faster?” Internally, I share that sentiment. Commuting shouldn’t be like this. The United States lags far behind the rest of the developed world in making movement easy, safe, and accessible.In Switzerlandand Chile, convenient, electrified rail is the standard. In Tokyo or Taipei, trains generally staywithin a minute of schedule. Meanwhile,Amsterdam,Paris, andCopenhagenare incredibly bike-friendly cities. Withbillions of dollarslost annually to the costs of car traffic,a significant spikein pedestrian deaths, and aworsening climate crisis, our government should be investing heavily in alternative modes of transportation. And yet we don’t — perhaps because of the influential oil industry, unwarranted stigma around who uses transit, or a legacy ofsystemically racisturban planning policies. These thoughts weigh on my mind as the train inches toward Central. Yet, traveling outside the confines of a car driver’s seat, I realize I can direct my attention beyond my destination. I observe those riding alongside me. Even as we all tire from a system in distress, the train provides a sense of community. Together, we can make our transportation system better. We can embrace mobility justice and actively work to fix theunfair disadvantagescertain people face when they move. To achieve this goal, we must build infrastructure that everyone can use. Creating seamless connections between neighborhoods through well-planned transit hubs, dedicated bus lanes, and safer sidewalks can help people access jobs, schools, and essential services without barriers. The train finally enters Park Street Station. I step out of it and onto the platform, stopping and looking around for a second. Every day, somewhere around 15,000 Bostonians hustle in and out of this station — parents and children, blue-collar and white-collar workers, townies and transplants. True to the city, someone yells an expletive as they narrowly miss the train’s closing doors. I see a bustling hub of people longing for a dependable transportation system. Their stories embody the urgency of reshaping our transportation landscape. Reducing our region’s dependence on cars and shifting towards sustainable transit serves the need forenvironmental resilience and social cohesion. I long for a future where mobility is transformative. For now, I check my stopwatch. 38 minutes and 35 seconds. I sigh and jog up the steps.

state_press_2023_8,"Spin electric scooters are lined up in Phoenix on Monday, Sept. 16, 2019. ASU policy states that electric scooters and other motorized vehicles areprohibitedon campus, a measure meant to prevent accidents. However, this ban hasn t been properly enforced, jeopardizing the safety of students all over campus, and ASU needs to do a better job of protecting them. Erin Levy, a freshman studying nursing who often commutes to the Tempe campus, said that although e-scooters are convenient ways to get around campus, they endanger students especially when they violatewalk-only zones. There s a lot of people that don t follow the rules, Levy said. And that s when it can get dangerous and start causing injuries. Despite the fact that motorized vehicles are banned on campus outright, some ASU students continue to encounter dangerous situations with someone on an electric scooter or skateboard. The University has even continued to hold designated campuslocations for scooter parking. READ MORE:Why can t you park Bird and Lime scooters on the Tempe campus anymore? Annie Sonu, a sophomore studying business law, said a person riding an e-scooter ran into her when she was walking down E. Apache Boulevard. He just slammed straight into me, Sonu said. I got knocked back and fell onto the ground. He probably fell over too, but that knocked the wind out of me so hard. Ever since then, I m really wary of people that go super fast on electric scooters and skateboards. Although Apache Boulevard is adjacent to campus, it is an area where student housing is located so students being reckless on their motorized vehicles is still an issue. E-scooterscan reach speedsof 15 to 25 miles per hour, making their collision with pedestrians extremely dangerous. They re a big enough threat in Arizona to warrant their ownwarning pageon law group consulting sites due to the rate of accidents. Although e-scooters can be a hazard to pedestrians, there are ways for students who ride them to minimize harm to those around them. This is an alternative for ASU if enforcing the ban entirely is unrealistic. Echo Lim, a junior studying psychology, is aware that students don t feel positively toward scooter users but makes sure to ride her scooter responsibly on campus. What I usually do is I put (the scooter on safe mode. So that way the scooter itself goes to a certain amount of miles, but it doesn t go so fast that it’s zipping, Lim said. I also try to ring my bell because it s good communication. However, even having students ride their motorized vehicles carefully is not enough to prevent accidents, especially in walk-only zones. It is ASU s responsibility to make sure its own policies are enforced and to also hold those with reckless behavior accountable. They (ASU could work on making sure that if there are accidents that they take care of them right away. Levy said. Keep the people accountable because they can go out and (continue to do the same thing. It is understandable that completely banning the usage of scooters is hard to regulate with how vast the Tempe campus is. In that case, changes to ASU policy can be done to help enforce campus safety. Walk-only zones at ASU are enforced Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. No one can walk, drive or park any kind of wheeled-vehicle in certain zones, including Cady Mall, Tyler Mall, Hayden Mall, Orange Mall and Palm Walk. These locations are imposed by campus mall enforcement staff members who require students to walk their wheeled vehicles in the zone. Any student who violates it will receive a written warning. Continued infractions will lead to asecond or third violation with a referralto the Dean of Students, Dean or Vice President. One solution is for these three levels of violations to also apply to e-scooters and motorized skateboards, even if it is being walked by a student in the zone. Levy also suggested that the University or ASU PD fine students who have a motorized vehicle on campus. There could be speed limits around campus for scooters especially, Lim said. If implementing the policy as is proves to be difficult, then it would be useful for ASU to tweak the rules to a realistic standard that they would be able to keep track of, and encourage students who do use motorized vehicles to be aware of their surroundings. Whether the University encourages students to be more responsible or enacts harsher punishments for violations of walk-only zones, it is needed to better protect student safety.

crimson_2023_45,"Harvard’s undergraduate population is egregiously unrepresentative of the broader American demographic. According to The Crimson’s freshman survey, over a quarter of the Class of 2025 comes from families in the 95th income percentile or higher. Nearly half of students’ parents earn more than twice the national average income. Harvard is a university where privilege is pervasive. However, for those like me, who do not come from such a privileged background, the adjustment to life here can be difficult. For those less fortunate, privilege lies in smaller things: Not worrying about where their next meal is coming from, not having to work while in high school to support their family, and not fretting about asking their parents for money to partake in the little joys of life. So whether we like it or not, attending Harvard means stepping into a world of privilege unlike anything we’ve ever encountered — a world that many of us never imagined we would inhabit. Coming to Harvard is an adjustment for everyone, but those who come from wealth have a leg up: They already know how to navigate the nuances of an Ivy League school. I remember having conversations — or, more honestly, listening to others have conversations — where I was hesitant to talk because I was unsure of what was going on. “Comping” clubs freshman year feels daunting to everyone, but it’s much harder when you’ve never heard of a “comp” before. Disparities in background become even more pronounced at the pre-professional level. Knowledge about internship programs and their application timelines, and skills like interview preparation and networking — whatever that means — require experience that students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often lack, necessitating a learn-as-we-go approach. Similarly, students frequently don’t have the money to purchase prep materials for internships and graduate school. And on top of all that, less privileged students are less equipped to find advisors who could help them ameliorate these disparities. Harvard has a variety of resources to help students prepare for life beyond undergrad, yet these resources are often decentralized and hard to navigate. Simply knowing someone who knows what Harvard is like before you get here can provide significant stress relief, especially during freshman year. Privilege also takes a social dimension. At the extreme end, wealth disparity can lead to students from less privileged backgrounds feeling the need to keep up with their more affluent friends. Extravagant trips to exotic places can serve as glaring reminders of this disparity. However, Harvard, through both its academic departments and its student organizations, does a good job making opulent opportunities available to as many students as it can. From club retreats in Cape Cod to subsidized January term or spring break trips, there are many ways one can experience the world on Harvard’s dime. Yet for those of us unaccustomed to such luxuries, these experiences can feel strange. Even small things, like fancy dinners on campus, may be entirely new — we often don’t know how to dress, what to say or which utensil to pick up first, and I still forget sometimes — are all things we have to adapt to. And it almost feels wrong to enjoy the wealth, because we are well aware of the myriad other ways that money could have been spent. However, there is something, I believe, that people who don’t come from extreme affluence understand better than most: The stakes of being here. Most of us are well aware of the fact that Harvard can measurably change our lives, because we aren’t surrounded by people who have had such luxury. The spot we take up is one we undoubtedly deserve, but also a spot that could have changed someone else’s. If this sounds like you, remember this: Just because your spot could have changed someone else’s life doesn’t mean that you need to work twice as hard to prove you deserve it. You do not need to take five classes every semester, join every club on campus, and push yourself to the point of exhaustion. Nor should you succumb to the pressure to do the thing that looks the best on a resume instead of what is best for your happiness. I plead you to have an honest conversation with yourself about how you spend your time at Harvard — the earlier the better. There are many things I wish I could have done differently, opportunities I wish I had at least known about my first two years here. I don’t intend to make you feel guilty. Everyone has their own acclimation timeline, and it is not easy to settle in when you come from a very different world. Harvard was built for the elite and still embodies much of that past today, so those not from wealth have to learn the right mannerisms. But the spot you occupy is rightfully yours, and that you should never feel the need to go about your time here doing what others may expect you to do. David I.

crimson_2023_3,"Campus tourists are annoying. At Harvard, this stance is a basic tenet of undergraduate life. Most of us adopt it quickly and uncritically, expressing disdain from the first instance of uninvited photography or blocked walkways. Our annoyance seems reasonable — this campus is our place, so goes the common refrain, and we shouldn’t have to deal with the constant, near-voyeuristic intrusion of outsiders in our place of living and learning. Our unspoken logic is simple: We belong here, and they do not. Naturally salient but not explicit are claims of entitlement (we deserve to be here; they don’t , superiority (we’re good enough to be here; they’re not , and ownership (Harvard is ours, not theirs . This line of reasoning is awfully precarious. Our sense of entitlement, superiority, and ownership all rely on status gained from a single decision made by the Admissions Office. Is it truly reasonable to claim that acceptance to Harvard — a mark of “merit” steeped heavily in chance,privilege, andlegacy status— effects such immediate and certain distinction? Undoubtedly, Harvard students have a claim to ownership at Harvard — we’re the ones who power its research and pay its tuition. But we’re not the only ones who can rightfully claim ownership. Whether we like it or not, Harvard — the school, the symbol, the mythology, the history — is a project of joint ownership. As a practical matter, the university benefits from massive indirect public investment via hidden taxpayer subsidies disguised in the form of its tax-free endowment. As of 2015, this benefit was equivalent to $48,000 per student, almostfive timesthe taxpayer investment per student at Massachusetts’s flagship public university. From a historical perspective, too, Harvard is a monument, a national symbol. Our university has educated eight U.S. presidents and is older than the nation itself. It is inextricably linked to American history. From any perspective, it’s only reasonable that Harvard be, at the very least, available for public viewing. Most importantly, Harvard’s immense cultural clout marks it as an object of public interest and ownership. Consistent media coverage, recurrent public debates, outsize importance in politics and business, and regular Hollywood attention all contribute to a near-obsessive level of public attention — a veritable “cult of Harvard” in American popular culture. We’ve all encountered it in impressively uncreative nicknames from high school friends, copy-and-paste Linkedin entreaties from Harvard hopefuls, and the oddly exhilarating dread that arises when asked “Where do you go to college?” It’s the same cultish attraction driving the tourist swarms. And we hate it. Or so we say. But we don’t actually hate the cult of Harvard; in fact, for many, if not most, of us, it’s part of the reason we’re here. It figured in our decision to commit to Harvard, and it undergirds our self-image and self-worth — whether we admit it or not. This makes sense: In our putatively meritocratic society, going to Harvard is the ultimate mark of success. The clout, attention, and brand power of the Harvard pin on our lapels provide real goods — both material and psychological. So why do the tourists irritate us? If their presence is just a particularly immediate manifestation of the cultural fixation we seem to enjoy, our exasperation makes no sense. Shouldn’t we enjoy all the attention they provide? Rather, our excessive annoyance with campus tourists reveals something else: an ambivalence about the cult of Harvard — a preoccupation with several unresolved questions over our university’s peculiar cultural role. For example: Is the cult of Harvard just? I assume many would join me in arguing that the immense prestige afforded to Harvard alumni in the professional world produces and exacerbates systemic inequities. Is the cult of Harvard democratic? The predominantbias toward Harvard graduatesin American politics, almost by definition, is not conducive to representative government. Does the cult of Harvard reflect reality? Is this university really the best, permanently and axiomatically?Forbes,U.S. News,QS,Times Higher Education, andNichedon’t seem to think so. And perhaps most importantly, is the cult of Harvard really good for us, Harvard’s students? Does it set realistic and healthy expectations? Does it prepare us to participate in our communities with humility and integrity? Each semester I spend here, I become increasingly concerned that the answer is no. These are reasonable and important ethical questions. They should be pondered by every critical and compassionate thinker in this community of enormous privilege and cultural power. We should shout them at administrators, job recruiters, admissions officers, and each other. They should become topics of debate, reason for self-interrogation, and fodder for genuine unease. No matter where it takes us, the targets of this unease should not be campus tourists, who are merely partaking in a cult of Harvard they had no part in creating. So long as the cult of Harvard continues to benefit us, we need to let go of the antipathy. Let the tourists be tourists. Noah B.

stanforddaily_2023_32,"Some say actions speak louder than words. In the case of Stanford’s administration,leaders saythey care about student well-being, “prioritize student affordability,” and are committed to working with student leadership. However, their actions tell adifferent story: one of a university that prioritizes its own interests over student well-being, especially its graduate students whoseunderpaid laborpowers Stanford’s excellence.

Consider a few examples: The “partnership” that we have worked in earnest to cultivate as a Graduate Student Council has been betrayed.The trust is broken. We have often heard that change takes time at a decentralized university like Stanford. Yet, Stanford has had years to address these growing concerns.

Every year, Stanford leadership fails to act on these critical issues, effectively punting change to a new cohort of student leaders.It stops with us.

crimson_2023_101,"Most people’s idea of a perfect lecture probably doesn’t involve holding back tears for a full hour — but when the thing you’ve been waiting for over the course of your college career finally comes to fruition minutes after you take your seat, sometimes it can’t be helped. On February 1, an email from the director of the Asia Center elicited my own class-time encounter with this peculiar, salty joy. The news in my inbox? In the coming months,Harvard will hire a preceptor to teach Tagalog— the most-spoken language in the Philippines, the native tongue of my mother’s family, and the language, as Iuncovered for The Crimson in December 2021, that Harvard affiliates leading the United States colonial education system in the Philippines once worked to suppress. Harvard has existed for nearly four centuries — all of those years as a settler institution on unceded Native land, over a third of them as an active site of enslavement, and approximately a quarter of them as an observer of the legacy of the overseas colonial education system that it helped to establish. Through administrators that bore its degrees, its pedagogical training, and its presidential seal of approval, Harvard designed and implemented a system of mandatory English-only instruction in the Philippines — ignoring contemporaries’ concerns that it would lead to cultural destruction and building the foundations for a pernicious, enduring form of internalized racismknown as colonial mentality. Yet for over 120 years following the U.S. invasion of the Philippines, which occurred concurrently with the installation of a Harvard graduate as the colonial superintendent of education, Harvard found no reason to offer the language of a country whose colonizationhelped launch the U.S.into its modern-day position as a global superpower. Never mind that through the 1990s, Filipinos were the second largest immigrant group in the U.S. Never mind that today, Tagalog remains the fourth most-spoken primary language in the nation, following only English, Spanish, and Chinese. And never mind that students in the Harvard Philippine Forum spent years advocating for Tagalog courses, sending countless unanswered emails to the administration in what appeared to be the one exception to Harvard’snotable commitment to funding “obscure languages.” The only possible reason for this lack of a reason is systematic ignorance: an inexcusable unawareness of the significance of Tagalog in the daily operations of this country, or a decontextualized false belief that Tagalog lacks use because most Filipinos also speak fluent English. This belief that an entire language — and all of its embedded memories, legends, worldviews, and possibilities — is of little to no value compared with English and thus permissible to mute has colonial precedent; its hypothesized role here is nothing new. For over 120 years, Harvard has perpetuated the same brand of ideological ignorance in the academic setting both at home and abroad, its manufactured silence spanning the Pacific, its halls reverberating outwards with deafening white noise. *** In the weeks since I first received that fateful email, my processing of the news has taken place in parallel with preparation for Cultural Rhythms, Harvard’s oldest and largest multicultural production. Tomorrow, members of Harvard Philippine Forumwill perform tinikling, a folk dance in which two dancers deploy strategic footwork between clapping bamboo poles. Some say tinikling was inspired by the grace of the hopping tikling bird; others, the defiance of farm workers who learned to dodge bamboo-stick strikes to their ankles during the period of Spanish colonialism. Either way, it is one of the most popular dances in the Philippines and in the Filipino American community — a form of cultural articulation whose boisterous, joyous noise-making infectiously invites more. My mother lost the angles of her mother tongue by the time she finished high school in Los Angeles; like many second-generation Filipino Americans — a group that in 2004 lacked heritage language fluencyat a rate nearly 40 percent higherthan the average across Asian immigrant groups — my inheritance was a mouth rounded by soft English words, assimilated, accentless. But my mother taught me tinikling when I was seven, her old college costume of woven piña cloth loose over my girlish frame. I learned to dance where my tongue was severed, borrowing another form of language to graft on the space of the wound. The diaspora is like this: a series of survivors’ translations, a making of music from shipwrecked tongues. Unable to speak Tagalog, I cannot name what was lost. But I have found other ways to speak — just as my mother did, and just as Filipino American scholars and students and advocates have for decades. Amid institutions filled with white noise, we articulate translation after translation to keep our heritage alive, audible if you know how to listen. *** Harvard’s existence can be understood as both an overarching legacy and as a series of individual moments, including the present, within that legacy. This is how people can be harmed by what Harvard was, even if it is no longer — even if itrepatriates the stolen artifacts,redresses the sinister ties, offers the severed language. For groups experiencing the material and ideological effects of Harvard’s role in U.S. empire, when do present instantiations of the University outweigh its legacy? I do not mean to suggest that we seek a return to a mythical pre-colonial essence; such an aim is not only impossible, but also misrepresentative of the ever-shifting nature of culture and identity. From a material standpoint, however, Harvard’s legacy is still largely a form of manufactured ignorance. Currently, only one course on the Philippines is offered at the College; Southeast Asia, made illegible between South and East Asian studies, entirely lacks a formal department; and the effects of Harvard’s pedagogy still linger noxiously in the transpacific setting,producing psychological scarsthat cannot easily be unmade. The hiring of a Tagalog preceptor is a necessary first step; it is also just one instantiation in a legacy made of instantiations, one novel articulation in a century-long speech. So while I am undeniably elated by the news of Tagalog’s offering, I refuse to celebrate Harvard for a legacy it has yet to remake. Instead, I celebrate those who made this current moment possible — those who have been gradually drowning out Harvard’s systematic white noise by speaking alternate tongues of resistance all along. I celebrate the students who argued with an apathetic administration for years, making the presence of the community audiblethrough rhythm and danceeven when Harvard refused to listen. I celebrate the alumni in the Philippines who raised support for the new position, amplifying the call for Tagalog until it was heard by the right people. I celebrate director James Robson and the staff at the Asia Center who worked to create an institutional space for Southeast Asia, translating a decades-long dream into decisive action. And most of all, I celebrate the preceptor and students who, in the coming months and years, will give new voice to once-muted words. Articulated through angular tongues and joyous noise, their proud, boisterous Harvard is the one that I hope, someday, to celebrate. Eleanor V.
