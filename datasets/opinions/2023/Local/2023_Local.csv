hawaiitribune_herald_2023_148,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°A Now Hiring sign posted in the window of a restaurant looking to hire workers on May 5, 2023, in Miami. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images/TNS The new Dollar General store in my rural Illinois hometown couldn’t open for the longest time because it couldn’t find workers. Apples rotted on the ground at Arends Orchard nearby because the 50-year proprietor couldn’t find help.How many times have you heard this lament from small business owners? “People just don’t want to work anymore.”Labor force participation as a percentage of possible workers has been trending down in recent decades. One factor out of several possible explanations for workforce reduction? Among the able-bodied in my childhood post-World War II, work was required to eat. Today, it isn’t. Many people, young and not so, have apparently developed lifestyles that support them adequately with no, or minimal, work “on the books,” that is, in a regular job.I am fascinated, for example, by a family that lives on the edge of my hometown. For at least two decades, the nine members of this “family” have been existing largely to play video games, it seems, and laze around the two-bedroom ranch home that is deteriorating around them, not so slowly. One of the three men in this family has fathered three children by three mothers, some of whom live in the home.(This account is based on an interview with the father of the 50-ish “patriarch” of the family. My source lets his son and clan live there rent-free, though his patience has reached its end. The source lives elsewhere. Two social worker friends in the area tell me this type of family is far from unique in rural Illinois. How does the family support itself? Two of the women are certified nursing assistants and work a few hours a month each at nursing homes. Two of the men are skilled at digital technology. Infrequently, they work off the books, repairing computers. The two seemingly able-bodied men are also on disability, for mental health and physical reasons, respectively.Then, there is the panoply of nonprofit and government support programs. Food is largely supplied with visits to more than one area food pantry each month and by the Link card, which debits the government for food for the low-income.There are also the federal and Illinois income tax credit programs, which provide tax reductions and in Illinois cash tax refunds for individuals whose work income is below a certain level. There are also utility bill, rental assistance and other support programs for the low-income.I am not opposed to any one of these programs, nor to helping people in need. And I know many single parents struggle mightily to make a decent life for themselves and their kids, even with these programs.I simply point out that strategies can be — and are — developed by some to create an alternative lifestyle that avoids participating in conventional work.There are indeed “costs” involved in working, which are obvious, but not often thought about, at least not by me. For example, work hours take away from opportunities to play video games, as well as pursue other avocations. Work may also be stressful, hard, unrewarding, boring and exhausting.The result of the work or no-work conundrum may be, rationally for some, to opt for no work. This doesn’t seem fair to those who work and indirectly support those who don’t.According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, our nation’s labor force participation rate declined steadily from 67% in 2000 to 63% this year. By my back-of-the-envelope reckoning, each percentage point of difference represents about 2 million potential workers who weren’t participating. Thus, if we were back at year 2000 levels of labor force participation, there would be roughly 8 million more Americans working today than are doing so.What to do? Options range from kicking people off the dole to making work more attractive, with higher pay and better workplace environment. Another option that I think bears more discussion: Admit that adults have a right to an alternative, de minimis work lifestyle, yet calibrate their government and other benefits to the value they add to society. Little value added equals few benefits. For example, at one time, volunteering in one’s community was required in return for food stamps.People who don’t want to work should not live off the sweat of our brows.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.DENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler."
leoweekly_2023_54,"As fate would have it, our old fake news sorta became real news as KY passed HB 47, a restrictive medical marijuana bill that only allows non-smokable forms of marijuana to be used by a limited number of medical conditions. In addition, the bill restricts where the marijuana can be purchased or grown. KY also passed sports betting legislation in the last day of its session on March 30.In the spirit of April Fool s Day, we thought we d throw back to this old banger from our2019 LEO Fake Issue.Kentucky legalizes marijuana: Gun shops, churches given preference as pot dispensariesUnable to pass pension or sports betting bills as the state headed toward bankruptcy, lawmakers unanimously approved a bill to legalize and tax marijuana for medical and recreational use.Gov. Matt Bevin signed HB 420 into law immediately, noting that legalizing marijuana would bring millions of dollars to the state, rescue public pensions and “hopefully cool out all of those naysayers and nitpickers at the failing, boring Courier Journal.”“I had a come to Jah moment earlier today and realized that Kentucky can be a model for the nation in how to use marijuana responsibly, to fill the pension’s deficit and... Wait, what are we talking about? Have you ever looked closely at paper, dude?!” he said during the signing ceremony at the Capitol.The surprise vote came late into the night on the last day of the legislative session during a meeting of the Public Pensions Working Group, which had worked fruitlessly for months to get rid of teachers’ pensions. The holdup was mostly because teachers hold great power at the ballot box and, while lawmakers are ideologues, they are characteristically craven and self-serving.According to several lawmakers at the meeting, new support for the pot bill came when Republican state Sen. Dan Seum told the group including Bevin that doctors had given him a “nice bottle of Oxycontin” for his cancer.“I threw it in the garbage can and went home and smoked a joint,” the 79-year-old lawmaker said. “And guess what? No nausea. I was able to function. I was going through the chemo treatment. It was during the legislative session. I did not miss a day due to nausea from the cancer.”And, then, Seum handed out brownies that he said he had baked specially for Bevin, four of the House and Senate leadership and the 20 other lawmakers.Among them was Republican Senate President Robert Stivers, who had called pot “a gateway drug” that no credible studies had shown was of medicinal value other than “it makes you feel good.” But, he said, Seum’s story convinced him, and the brownies brought new clarity.“I need to get his recipe,” he said with a wink. “But, seriously, I was wrongheaded about pot. I mean, legalizing it is a win-win for Kentucky... brah.”House Majority Floor Leader John “Bam” Carney, who controls which bills get called for a vote to the House floor, was not in the meeting and told reporters later that he would not call a vote on the bill. But after meeting privately with Seum, Carney said he had changed his mind and would bring the bill to an immediate vote after he hit the Speedway for Doritos and a Red Bull.“What can I say?” he told reporters. “I had never tried it until now. We Republicans are so used to legislating on issues about which we have no personal experience, like abortion. We preach smaller government, so who are we to say what people can do in their own homes?”The governor said Kentucky will immediately begin issuing licenses for pot dispensaries, giving preference to gun shops and churches. “What is more Kentucky than weed, weapons and the Holy Spirit,” a glassy-eyed Bevin told reporters. “Besides, that pain in my neck from carrying around my unusually large bobble-head has magically disappeared! Maybe it will make me less of a pain in the ass!”Not everyone was in favor of the bill. Among critics was, not surprisingly, chronic curmudgeon and downer Martin Cothran, senior policy analyst-spokesperson for the righteous-leaning Family Foundation.“Smoking the Devil’s weed will just bring you further from Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,” he said. “It is a gateway drug to hell, and selling the state for doobies is sinful and reprehensible. Have you tried these brownies?” •*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_33,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Getting the nation’s soaring debt under control should be a national priority. But many special-interest groups don’t agree.Last week, newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson told his colleagues that he would soon hold a vote on forming a bipartisan commission to study the nation’s fiscal trajectory.“The greatest threat to our national security is our nation’s debt,” he said. “We know this is not going to be an easy task, and tough decisions will have to be made. But the consequences if we don’t act now are unbearable. We have a duty to the American people to explain this to them so they understand it well. And we’re going to establish a bipartisan debt commission to begin working on this crisis immediately.”The speaker’s comments exude common sense. The deficit this past fiscal year hit $2 trillion. The debt has soared past $33.7 trillion. The interest payments on the debt now exceed defense spending and will continue to crowd out other priorities. Simply borrowing more money to finance an ever-expanding federal government is a path toward economic disaster and fiscal ruin.Yet Johnson’s remarks were met in some quarters with hostility and skepticism, particularly from political hysterics in the “Republicans want to throw grandma off the cliff” crowd.“This commission is designed to subvert the will of the American people,” said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, “by fast-tracking cuts to Social Security and Medicare behind closed doors.”Can we at least see the panel’s suggestions before dismissing its formation? Besides, does Altman believe that endangering the nation’s fiscal health will be beneficial in the long term to the recipients of Social Security and Medicare? Doing nothing only exacerbates the problem.Critics are on more solid footing when they say that forming a commission is a dodge intended to shield Congress from responsibility for a problem of its own making. After all, we’ve gone down this road before — most recently in 2010 when President Barack Obama formed the Simpson-Bowles commission to study deficit reduction — only to throw the recommendations into the shredder.Such pronouncements are true, to an extent. But the spending problem in Washington has only worsened in recent years, adding urgency to the debt debate. The issue, according to polls, is also at the forefront of many voters’ concerns.Johnson’s committee should conduct its business openly and consider a wide range of potential solutions to controlling the red ink — even those that are anathema to one party (tax hikes or the other (spending cuts . It’s admittedly a long shot, but fostering vigorous discussion and debate on the debt may be the first step toward accepting and implementing solutions.— Las Vegas Review-JournalNEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

eugeneweekly_2023_52,"We ve got issues. I currently have six out of eight kids home very sick. At what point does it matter that their immune systems are compromised by the Zip-O-Laminators company choices, interrupting their REM sleep every night? We are woken at 3:45 am every single weekday, and unable to rest or get away from the vibration and piercing low sound that goes throughout our entire house. Two hours of fever, crying and unsettled sick children from this company’s actions going against the voted emergency noise ordinance. This big company sneers in the face of its government laws, of mayor and Eugene City Council decisions, of its suffering community, of my family and children. The City Council voted Jan. 23 to amend the code for commercial and industrial noise to include low-frequency sounds. Two and a half years of damage to our health, quality of daily life and mental health. We have communicated and pleaded with Zip-O to first just change the hours, and then to create some kind of working sound barrier to both the vibration and noise. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Also, as small as it seems, there’s additional damage to our property values, as no one would choose to live in this large community, trapped in the damaging daily survival cycle this Zip-O company has knowingly created for us. People who have lived here 20 years are talking about moving because what was once a thriving, growing community has become a literal sleep deprived nightmare over the last 2.5 years. Please help with the next steps of what the next level of governance may be available to help us. The company doesn’t appear to care about our lives or the small $250 daily fine. Does the fine start immediately since we have an emergency ordinance in place? I have one daughter who is suffering and struggling with sleep, sound, mental health and school. She is 12, and all of her struggles exploded two years ago. She has prescription sleeping meds now. She struggles with school work, as so many other families and their children do with both work and learning on such sleep deprivation. None of this is acceptable. If this were your daughter, granddaughter, mother, father, son or beloved, would it be? I have a spouse fighting a major illness, and without daily decent REM sleep, will not be healthy and strong. At what point do we walk our walk of caring for our communities and each other over a company that has made absolutely no viable changes after our communities have begged directly for 2.5 years? At what point does it matter that our City Council and mayor are trying to help but being ignored by this company? Anyone out there in our music recording world interested in helping record these daily/nightly vibrations? There are five miles of communities being negatively affected. I believe there are some among you who have the specialized skills to help? Anyone know a great lawyer who believes in fighting for the communities and quality of life that is being hurt everyday, backed by lots of science around lack of REM sleep and damage? This week the sound/vibration started at 3 am one day, the usual 3:45 am to 4 am the rest. Any caring, great pro bono class action attorneys willing to help our communities fight the daily damages occurring in our lives and put a stop to it in the only language they seem to care about, money? We have been reaching out and trying to work with this company and people for years. The damage is vast and real to each person and family affected. These are our communities, many multigenerational, now hostages in their beloved homes by a big money company whose lack of actions or acknowledgement shows a clear intent to continue its forced damage on our lives, our daily liberties and the physical and emotional means for the pursuit of happiness. Thank you, Eugene communities, City Council, and mayor for your continued actions and efforts to help those of us suffering this avoidable trauma. Ashanti Li is a longtime Eugene area resident, mother and has been a foster mother, a volunteer for Oregon Country Fair and involved in many other local groups."
suffolknewsherald_2023_19,"Published 8:45 pm Friday, June 16, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldSeveral important days are on our calendars this week, none of which we should forget.Today, Sunday, June 18, we celebrate our dads and honor them for all they do, while Monday, June 19 brings Juneteenth, a day celebrated to mark the end of slavery in the United States.Tuesday, June 20 brings another day of importance — it’s primary election day across VirginiaVoters will make their choices on which candidates will represent their political party in selected House of Delegates and state Senate races. It’s important to note that not all Democratic and Republican party contests are being decided Tuesday, as some are uncontested and others were determined through party conventions or firehouse primaries.In Suffolk, the Republican Party has two races up for grabs — nominees in the 17th District Senate and the 84th House District races.In the Senate race, Del. Emily Brewer from Isle of Wight faces Emporia businessman Hermie Sadler for the nomination. The GOP House race is between two Suffolkians, Michael Dillender and Rod Thompson.The city’s Democrats have only one contest to decide Tuesday. Voters will choose between Nadarius Clark and Michelle Joyce to represent their party this fall in the 84th House District.All of Suffolk is included in the 17th Senate District, while only specific precincts are included in the 84th House District races.Because Virginia holds open primaries and does not require voters to register with a political party, all voters are able to take part in Tuesday’s elections. When going to the polls, voters simply tell election officials whether they want to vote in the Republican or Democratic primary.The polls open Tuesday at 6 a.m. and close at 7 p.m.The State Board of Elections reminds voters that “Virginia law requires all voters to provide either an acceptable form of ID or sign an ID confirmation statement at the polls. Voters arriving at the polls without an acceptable form of ID will be required to either sign an ID Confirmation Statement or vote a provisional ballot.”The elections website goes on to explain that if a voter votes a provisional ballot, they will have until noon on the Friday following the election to deliver a copy of identification to their locality’s electoral board or sign an ID confirmation statement in order for their provisional ballot to be counted.While many people may not see the importance of voting in a primary, it offers residents the chance to cast a ballot for a favorite candidate on either side of the political aisle in hopes they help that person secure a spot on the November general election ballot.As we have seen from previous elections, every vote does count. This means that a few votes here or there can often determine a candidate’s fate.Mark that calendar and take the time Tuesday to participate in the primary.Suffolk Registrar Burdette Lawrence has many more details for those who are registered about voting here at her website, suffolkva.us/773/registrar.

suffolknewsherald_2023_127,"Published 6:04 pm Friday, February 10, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardNot only is Tuesday Valentine’s Day (don’t worry, there’s still time to snag a dozen roses or a heart-shaped box of chocolates , but Feb. 14 also marks National Donor Day, an effort to encourage more people to discuss the lifesaving importance of organ and tissue donation.Currently, there are more than 100,000 people in the United States on waiting lists for transplants. Unfortunately, it’s estimated that each day 17 people will die before receiving a lifesaving donor organ. That’s more than 6,000 people per year.For perspective on this Super Bowl weekend, even the largest football stadium in the United States could not hold the number of patients on the national transplant waiting list. And every 10 minutes another person is added to the national transplant waiting list.The good news is that one person willing to donate their vital organs, corneas and tissue upon their death could save up to eight lives.Signing up for the donor registry is easy, and just about anyone can do it. There are no health or age limitations and it can be done when renewing a driver’s license or online at www.registerme.org.While it remains a personal decision and it can be difficult to discuss end-of-life preparations, it is important that loved ones know your intentions. We urge our readers to talk about organ donation, as it is a priceless gift that keeps on giving.Joining the Organ Donor Registry means you have made the decision to save and heal lives at the time of your death, if you are eligible. It won’t happen for many years, but at that time, what an amazing gift to give someone a second chance at life — a last act of love and kindness to another soul.National Donor Day is an observance dedicated to spreading awareness and education about organ, eye and tissue donation. National Donor Day was started in 1998 by the Saturn Corp. and its partner, the United Auto Workers, and is supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.National Donor Day is a time to focus on all types of donation — organ, eye, tissue, blood, platelets and marrow. It’s also a day to recognize those who have given and received the gift of life through organ, eye and tissue donation, are currently waiting for a lifesaving transplant, and those who died waiting because an organ was not donated in time.The more donors there are on the registry, the better odds those on transplant waiting lists have of getting organs they so desperately need to survive.So on this Valentine’s Day, after the good chocolates have been devoured, chat with your significant other and loved ones about your intentions. Don’t wait until it’s too late to make a difference.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

Why? Because in this business, that’s the right answer.It was that twisted logic that put me on the ground in three different battlefields — Angola, Somalia and Iraq.And while I never had much love for the military, I gained enormous respect for the soldiers, even if they couldn’t always tell me what they were fighting for.Now, there are two wars waging on the other side of the world, one in Ukraine and a new one in Israel, where a hospital was blown up and little kids have been kidnapped by murderous terrorists.President Joe Biden went to Israel last week to express America’s unwavering support, and upon his return he renewed his commitment to keeping U.S. troops out of both conflicts.Instead, Biden asked Congress for billions of dollars in military support for both Israel and Ukraine, which he said were “vital for America’s national security.”“History has taught us when terrorists don’t pay a price for their terror, when dictators don’t pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction,” he said last week in a rare Oval Office address. “They keep going. And the cost and the threat to America and the world keep rising.”Biden asked Congress for $105 billion, including $60 billion for Ukraine, much of which would replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles provided earlier.The request also includes $14 billion for Israel.The rest of the money sought would go toward unspecified humanitarian efforts, U.S.-Mexico border management and fentanyl trafficking — a renewed war on drugs, as it were.And, while Biden should be applauded for doing everything possible to keep American soldiers out of harm’s way, there is a disturbing air of moral superiority that goes along with this approach to war.Biden told “60 Minutes” that he was confident that Israel would act in accordance with the “laws of war,” as if such a thing has ever existed in the history of violent conflict.Exactly what law is it that allows the U.S. to wage war on two separate battlefields without getting its own hands dirty?Almost as disturbing as the battles on the ground abroad is the war of rhetoric on social media and in American streets, hate speech that has laid landmines for antisemitism and Islamophobia.Pro-Israeli protesters are saying Palestinians are evil.Pro-Palestinian demonstrators are saying Israelis are wicked.And the mask-wearing pro Hamas demonstrators are shamelessly celebrating, saying Israel got what it deserved.But where are the real protesters, the righteous ones, who say war itself is wrong? Where are they?Both sides in both battles will start claiming victory in wars no one can win. How can anybody say they won when a 6-year-old boy half a world away from the fighting is killed?Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian-American boy, was stabbed 26 times by his suburban Chicago landlord who was angry at the child’s family over the events in Israel.The little boy was not at war.“Israel and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity and peace,” Biden said in his address before calling Wadea’s family.“To all you hurting, I want you to know I see you. You belong. And I want to say this to you. You’re all Americans.”Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2023_131,"Published 4:15 pm Tuesday, February 7, 2023ByStaff ReportsFirst, I would like to thank the Suffolk News-Herald for the opportunity to express my opinion. I am a founding member of CARE4Suffolk, Citizens Against Rezoning Efforts for Suffolk, a group of concerned Suffolk residents who oppose irresponsible rezoning. We value the quality of life in Suffolk, and want to preserve it. We understand growth and change are essential, but we want to see the city grow and change responsibly by ensuring the infrastructure is in place, including schools, roads, and public utilities, before rezoning and development. We want to preserve wetlands and areas around our reservoirs, which serve as our drinking water and a precious resource for all of Hampton Roads. In addition, we value the heritage of our agricultural community and support keeping suburban sprawl from encroaching on farmland.Ensuring our goals and values starts with having a voice in the formation of the Suffolk 2045 Comprehensive Plan. The Suffolk Unified Development Ordinance points to the Comprehensive Plan as a policy document. The title of this document may indicate it is for future use years out. However, upon adopting the plan, it will guide and dictate Planning Commission and City Council decisions on many initiatives, including responding to rezoning applications. The existing 2035 comp plan has impacts on current rezoning and development applications. Therefore, Suffolk citizens must have a voice in the formation and content of the plan.In conjunction with the city, on Nov. 17, CARE4Suffolk hosted a public forum to discuss the Suffolk 2045 Comprehensive Plan, attended by many city representatives and concerned citizens. The public forum is an example of successful, positive interaction between city officials and citizens as ideas and concerns were exchanged. Following this positive engagement, the city is currently holding a series of winter Community Engagement Sessions to gather additional citizen concerns and ideas. I attended the meeting on Feb. 2 for the second of seven scheduled. Jennifer Moore of the Media and Community Relations department did an excellent job facilitating the engagement, which allowed the city to walk away with many ideas and a list of concerns shared by those in attendance.The second community engagement went well until the last five minutes, when Council Member Roger Fawcett, who represents the Sleepy Hole Borough and serves as the Chair of the 2045 Comprehensive Plan Steering Group, offered his closing remarks. Fawcett indicated that he did not want to discuss rezoning and told attendees that farmers have a right to sell their land. Several community members spoke out and agreed that farmers can sell their land, but the city does not have to rezone the land from agricultural to residential. Fawcett then said, “If you get the attitude that you are going to stop something, get a life!” setting off a blaze of citizen responses, as it did not sit well with most attendees.I believe that after the passing of the Port 460 rezoning, citizens concerned with that project felt as if the city was not listening to their voices, leading to a mistrust of city officials and their individual interests in such projects. CARE4Suffolk members have worked tirelessly to build relationships with city officials and to change feelings of mistrust by taking a positive approach to resolving issues and playing the citizen part of effecting positive change. Fawcett’s statement was damaging to the trust that we have built, as he indicated that citizens do not have a voice.In my opinion, at the least, Fawcett needs to step down or be removed and replaced from his position as the chair of the 2045 Comprehensive Plan Steering Group (appointed by Al Moor, the City Manager . This action would show that citizens “do” have a voice in the formulation of the 2045 Comp Plan and that not all city officials share in Fawcett’s opinion. Moor needs to put a person in that seat that can objectively hear our ideas and concerns and fold them into the final 2045 Comp Plan when it comes to fruition. This is my call to action for Al Moor to effect this change and give the people their voice.Dr. Sherri Johnston is the executive director of CARE4Suffolk (Citizens Against Rezoning Efforts for Suffolk .Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

We should embrace how close one is to the other and the unique entrepreneurship and activities happening in every part of our diverse community.Suffolk’s downtown is an integral part of commercial and social activity for residents from less-populated boroughs. Likewise, open spaces and outdoor activities are close-by for those living in the city center. The city has a chance with the 2045 Comprehensive Plan to create a vision for how we grow by enhancing this character and not making it harder for people to move into, out of, and around downtown.Suffolk’s agricultural heritage is vital in the success of many popular events that benefit the city, such as the Farmers Markets, Peanut Fest, the Plein Air Festival, Taste of Suffolk and the Earth and Arts Festival.Farmers markets have grown in popularity and local producers are helping to fill the void in a food desert, as seen at the pop-up market at the East Suffolk Recreation Center.Peanut Fest is our biggest event and we could better use this opportunity to keep agricultural heritage in the forefront by collaboration with local businesses.The Plein Air Festival brings in artists to paint the beauty of Suffolk’s waterways, landscapes and cityscapes. It highlights how nearby natural spaces benefit venues and businesses in the city center.People come from all over during Taste of Suffolk to enjoy a traditional, small-town city center that can’t be found in other parts of Hampton Roads.The Earth and Arts Festival happens along with the Suffolk Master Gardeners annual plant sale. This celebration of our planet captures the spirit of Suffolk’s connection with the land.Just outside of town there are fun things happening such as chicken swaps, fishing, Dismal Swamp adventures and an entire world of horses – barrel racing, shows, camps and trail riding. Where else can you grab a latte downtown and drive just minutes to see horses?These events grow larger every year and success hinges on the unique ways downtown and rural areas are tied together. Let’s not squander Suffolk’s character because special interest groups tell us we’ll be better off if we look and act like everywhere else. We need to decide now if Suffolk will be a dime a dozen or a diamond in the rough.Ann HarrisSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_109,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°This holiday season is a bleak time for Ukrainian civilians facing another winter of brutal Russian bombing — especially when GOP members of Congress have sent Vladimir Putin a huge Christmas gift by blocking further U.S. aid to Kyiv.It is also a tragic time for Israeli civilians traumatized by Hamas’ vicious attack, and for Palestinian civilians in Gaza suffering horribly from Israel’s military response.For those who are frustrated by a sense of helplessness and wondering how to help, one way is to donate to charities that are reaching civilians on the ground.In Ukraine, as soldiers battle on the front, civilian volunteer groups have held the country together. From the start of the war, women and men excused from the front lines have banded together to feed people in urban bomb shelters, rescue elderly Ukrainians from villages under fire, provide generators for those without heat and electricity, and help the internally displaced and wounded.The courage of ordinary people who risk their lives to help their countrymen is extraordinary and continues as the war nears the second-year mark. It reflects their determination not to fall under Russia’s despotic rule (and shreds the argument of those who claim Ukrainians fight only at NATO’s bidding .That is why, when it comes to Ukraine, I prefer to recommend smaller Ukrainian organizations, founded by Ukrainians (or Ukrainian Americans whose work I have seen in person.As I did last Christmas, I particularly recommend Ukraine TrustChain (ukrainetrustchain.org , whose teams deliver aid directly to where it is most needed, and whose terrific work I have witnessed in my reporting.Ukraine TrustChain was founded at the start of the war by two Ukrainian American childhood friends who had emigrated from Kyiv to Chicago and Philadelphia, respectively, when they were 10 years old. Their concept was to find team leaders among people they or their friends trusted in Ukraine, and have those volunteers build regional networks of people they trusted in turn. The money raised goes directly to the teams, with constant contact and periodic visits from board members in the U.S.In July, I traveled with a team of volunteers from the southern port of Odesa as they drove four hours in their own cars to the recently liberated city of Kherson, on the Dnieper River. The city is still under daily shelling from Russian troops on the opposite bank — we heard regular booms, sometimes close by. Parts of Kherson had been heavily flooded when the Russians blew up the Kakhovka Dam upriver to impede the movement of Ukrainian troops.Led by Alena Prizhebolska, a real estate agent before the war, the group dropped off some equipment to two local deminers trying to clear the area around a bus stop and a walking path. The group also unloaded sacks of vegetables to volunteer cooks at a shelter who were feeding locals whose houses had been destroyed by the flood.Then we drove to a dangerous area along the river, from which you could almost see Russian positions, where local volunteers were helping residents dig out the claylike muck that had poured into their houses when the flood waters hit.“Right after the flood, we bought a boat and evacuated survivors from the left bank,” Prizhebolska told me, as local homeowners rushed out to greet her. “Now, to save houses, Ukraine Trust Chain bought pumps to pump out water.”In the Kherson area, other Ukraine TrustChain teams are providing seeds, seedlings, and tools to thousands of small farmers in de-occupied areas who lost everything under Russian control.What is so amazing — and moving — is that this volunteer spirit has continued for nearly two years. Other teams bring food to villages on the front lines and evacuate those who seek to leave, while delivering firewood so that residents whose power lines have been bombed can survive the winter. And these actions do not come without risk for the volunteers. In November, one volunteer truck in Eastern Ukraine was nearly hit by a Russian drone.Meantime, the number of Ukraine’s military war wounded has mounted. For those who want to help, I again recommend Revived Soldiers of Ukraine (rsukraine.org which aids wounded soldiers at home and brings some to the U.S. to be fitted for prosthetics. I met one such soldier, brought to Philly for treatment, who had lost an arm and a leg defending Mariupol and was tortured by Russians while captive in a Russian hospital. He returned home to Odesa, is now married, and hopes to return to the fight.Another dedicated Ukrainian organization that helps Ukrainian amputees is Barvy (barvy.org . The group is the local Ukrainian partner for the Ukraine Iniatives run by the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Global Health program.Penn medical teams train Ukrainian surgeons in special techniques to salvage and repair blast wounds and regularly consult on cases. I met some of these wonderful Ukrainian surgeons and their gutsy military amputee patients in Vinnytsia on my July trip. I have also met some of their terrific Penn Medicine counterparts and will be writing more on this project. You can read more about the program, and also donate, at med.upenn.edu/globalhealth/ukraine-initiatives.When it comes to Israel and Gaza, here are a few groups I recommend:• IsraAID (israaid.org is Israel’s largest humanitarian aid organization and is supporting Israelis who have been evacuated from their homes along the Gaza border at over a dozen evacuation centers around the country, with mental health and psychosocial support. The organization is also building shelters for unrecognized Bedouin villages in Israel’s south which, unlike other Israeli cities and villages, do not have access to shelters from ongoing missile fire.• New Israel Fund (nif.org is an umbrella organization making grants to Israeli Jewish and Arab civil society organizations for the advancement of democracy, equal rights, and social justice. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, NIF has supported Israeli Jewish-Arab emergency efforts such as Have You Seen the Horizon Lately, in which hundreds of Jewish and Bedouin women gather to pack relief boxes for Jewish and Bedouin towns affected by the war.• To help get humanitarian aid into Gaza, I’m recommending international aid organizations that have the resources and staff inside the strip. Others — such as International Rescue Committee and Save the Children — are trying to get aid in.• Doctors Without Borders (doctorswithoutborders.org is a renowned international medical relief organization, which has doctors working inside Gaza.• UNICEF (UNICEF.org is the United Nations Children’s organization, which has support staff inside Gaza.Anera (anera.org is a long-standing Palestine refugee relief aid agency, which works with partners in the West Bank and Gaza.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
leoweekly_2023_15,"In light of the recent Overdose Awareness Day, writer Jordan McClements shared this letter with LEO. We think it s a great read and hope you do too.I overdosed on heroin in 2017, and second oldest Cousin overdosed, and died, in 2019.I blamed Dad for my heroin use, because Dad and I didn’t talk for ten years of my life.I was entangled in the nightmare from Dad, even though I talked to Dad, and wrote a novel forgiving Dad and Puh Pup, and what Puh Pup did to Dad, I didn’t forgive Dad or Puh Pup.I was still entangled in non-forgiveness.I was in my lifelong dramatization of the album,Spiderland, by Slint, from Louisville, Kentucky, recorded in August 1990, and released on Touch and Go Records, on March 27, 1991. Slint brought post-rock to the world.I stare into the mirror of the band members’ four crystal faces, submerging the black and white quarry on the front of the all black gatefold LP.Around the letterbox photograph, is the eruption of shadows, dancing your name.Jordan.I am 18 years old again.I am starting college at Delaware State University, again.I am no longer 28, going to Medill, at Northwestern University for Social Justice and Solutions Journalism.I have not written my novel,For He Who Rides the Pony, on the overdose crisis, at Columbia College Chicago.Second oldest Cousin isn’t dead from a heroin overdose.I haven’t overdosed on heroin and survived because second oldest Cousin saved me, yet.I haven’t tried heroin.This is me beforeSpiderland.I first met David Pajo, guitarist of Slint, and current guitarist of Gang of Four, in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, when I was in college, at a screening of the documentary on Slint,Breadcrumb Trail,by filmmaker, Lance Bangs.David was kind, and generous to me, when I asked David about the compositional approach toSpiderland.I was going to Delaware State University, majoring in English, so I could become a better writer. I didn’t play guitar, I never did. I didn’t believe in myself enough to play guitar, and at the time, dedicate myself between the essence and divide of touching eternity, to write.I was scared of telling my story, the story of losing Mom and Dad in two different car accidents, that Mom and Dad lived through, but never came back, a story I didn’t know existed, until I heardSpiderland.Maybe, the killing of myself.My ADHD was so severe, I could only read short stories, from the minimalist American writer, Raymond Carver. Dad, drank. The sentences, short.Slint’s lyrical approach connected to me instantly, just as Carver’s prose did. Every word counts.The delivery between screaming, whisper, and cautious regret.Everything I was scared of, in telling my story.I feltSpiderland, told my story.But the longer I listened toSpiderland’s musical compositions, the longer and deeper my psyche began to formulateSpiderland’s intricacies.The first time I saw Slint perform live, was on their last reunion tour on 1 May 2014, at Union Transfer, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.When everything went black at the concert, I began to consider who the imaginary audience was.Was I imagining my story played out on the stage, that I couldn’t perform?The person I went to the concert with, fell asleep on the side of the stage, and I realized, I, was the imaginary audience, the imaginary audience of self.Somewhere, I knew Slint was performing, but I watched my life playout on the stage of the concert.My memories were in orchestration, screaming, with clawed nails, trying to press smoothly, the rapture of guilt, that was smothering me.And it hit, like the needle does, used to, and echoes, in my eternity.I didn’t save Brother from getting abused by a family member in seventh grade.Dad, didn’t get help for what Puh Pup did to Dad.Dad didn’t get help, so Brother didn’t.I was in seventh grade.Pleading to Dad to take Brother to The Psychologist to help Brother because, Dad cried at the dinner table at night, telling us of the horror of Puh Pup hurting Dad, and Brother and I faced the Biblical wrath.Then one afternoon, while Dad was gone, to get back with Dad’s ex-wife, and not getting Brother help, I ran away.I didn’t talk to Dad for a decade.I invited Dad to my high school graduation and Dad didn’t come.Now, I am in college in 2014, Dad is here in Philadelphia, at the Union Transfer, Slint show.I feel Dad’s presence, because my psyche is Dad.Tomorrow is Dad’s birthday.2 May 1970.The concert ends, and when I buy aSpiderlandt-shirt, and Slint sweatshirt with the middle finger on it, I realize I don’t have enough money. Drummer, guitarist, singer, and lyricist for Slint, Britt Walford sees my shame, and thanks me for supporting the band, and to take both.We drive home from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Tomorrow, 2 May 2014, is Dad’s 44thbirthday, and Slint is playing.I want Dad to witnessSpiderland, where I live, where I am Dad, and somehow, myself, or Jordan.I buy two tickets to see Slint at the Otto Bar, in Baltimore, Maryland.Dad and I cross the Bay Bridge, and make it to the Otto Bar.Slint’s van is behind the Otto Bar’s building, with David Pajo’s Harley-Davidson motorcycle parked.David tells me it s cool that I brought Dad to the concert.Dad and David talk about Harley-Davidson motorcycles.Vocalist, guitarist, and lyricist for Slint, Brian McMahan, asks me if I play music, and I tell Brian I write, and the conversation steers from music to writing, Brian listening to me patiently, with kindness.I meet musician, of the electronic duo Matmos, and English scholar at Johns Hopkins University, Drew Daniel, in the crowd, and we talk about the similarities between Slint’s lyrics and Raymond Carver.Drew is kind, and tells me of his scholarship on the image of resting one’s hand on one’s face throughout history.Drew tells me to email him about literary theory.Dad comes back, destroyed from the bar, celebrating Dad’s birthday.I didn’t drink at the time, I thought I had learned something from Raymond Carver.The concert begins the same, but I am able to separate my psyche.I see my shadow, at first, in Dad, and whatever is left, is myself.But as I press further into my memories:Who is the imaginary audience?I realize Brother isn’t here.Brother isn’t here inSpiderland.It’s just me and Dad.Wrapped up in eternity.Me, and, Dad.Oldest Cousin, knew that I had tripped on mushrooms at Dad’s house, to the surprise of Dad’s boss coming over for dinner.Oldest Cousin said:“You need to call your Dad up, and tell your Dad, I’m sorry.”Oldest Cousin and I talked about the ten years I was away, and compared them to how second oldest Cousin is away.Second oldest Cousin isn’t alive, anymore.I knew Dad would not survive for us both to forgive, one another.I knew our ending, had already been written time through, playing out fate.But when I went home, I knew I would call Dad.Now, I’m 28, and no matter the medications, or drugs, it s just me, and, Dad, guessing who, is the imaginary audience, to heal the severed, between Dad and me.I had written a novel on forgiveness, and I was still vengeful.I have to remember Dad hurt also, as a result of the trauma.Oldest Cousin was right, calling Dad, and saying I’m sorry, is safer.Though, I still, miss you.*** ."
suffolknewsherald_2023_218,"Published 7:15 pm Friday, August 18, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldThe latest statistics on violent crime are out, and the picture isn’t pretty for Suffolk.Worse yet, Police Chief Al Chandler is missing in action at a time when jittery residents need accountability and reassurance from those responsible for their safety. Multiple attempts by the News-Herald to interview Chandler about Virginia State Police’s newest “Crime in Virginia” report have been unsuccessful.Now comes news of the arrest of two of Chandler’s officers on felony charges of obtaining money under false pretenses, plus counts of forgery and computer fraud.Suffolk residents are right to be disturbed. The first priority of any community is the safety of its citizens, and Suffolk has work to do in convincing people that its law enforcement agency is up to the task.In case you missed our related story earlier in the week, Virginia State Police’s annual report shows violent crimes and those against other people in Suffolk rose sharply during 2022.A dozen deaths due to murder and non-negligent manslaughter last year was up from seven in 2021, three in 2020, six in 2019 and just two in 2018.Aggravated assault ran about the same in 2022 and the year prior at 372 and 383, respectively. However, these cases were up from past years as the report shows aggravated assaults at 299 in 2020, 173 in 2109 and 151 during 2018, according to the report.The VSP report also shows rape is on the rise in the city.Forcible rape violations were up over the past five years, with 35 cases in 2022. That’s up from 29 in 2021 and 20 in 2020. In 2019 there were 30 reported forcible rapes and 2018 saw 31 reported forcible rapes, according to the report.Violations falling under crimes against person, which include murders, kidnapping, rape, aggravated and simple assaults, and intimidation, were up again last year, according to the report. During 2022, these violations totaled 2,308 in the city, up from 2,244 in 2021 and 2,025 in 2020. There were 1,999 of these types of violations reported in 2019 and 2,126 in 2018.The numbers are no surprise to anyone who regularly reads this newspaper, whose pages too often have to report about homicides and other violent crimes.When we last heard from Chandler in an interview with a News-Herald reporter last summer, the chief seemed to suggest that Suffolk’s violent-crime problem was overhyped.“We’ve always had gun violence as long as I’ve been here,” he said. “The numbers are higher, but it’s not earth-shattering. But, of course, any life that is lost is a tragedy.”The full numbers are in for 2022, and, contrary to the chief’s assessment, we’d say they’re indeed earth-shattering for a community that’s on the ball economically and in many other respects and should be a jewel among Hampton Roads localities.Violent crime cannot be allowed to stop Suffolk from reaching its full potential.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_72,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°President Joe Biden has been traveling the U.S. touting a manufacturing revival that he no doubt hopes will help his chances for re-election. Unfortunately, there is much less substance to this “Biden Boom” than the White House would have Americans believe. Even under the rosiest of projections, the administration’s signature programs will do little to increase manufacturing employment — and even less to uplift the overall economy.Construction spending on manufacturing facilities more than doubled from an annualized rate of $81 billion this time last year to an all-time high of nearly $200 billion in August. Some of that increase can be attributed to the incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, both championed by the president.But there are more relevant factors. Shortages caused by COVID, backlogs at major ports in 2021 and a three-year-long surge in retail sales created a compelling case for reshoring production even without those incentives. Spending on consumer goods is 30% higher now than when the pandemic started, and global supply chains have yet to fully recover. So a near-term expansion in domestic manufacturing was all but inevitable.Another reason the recent run-up in manufacturing investment is not as impressive as it might seem: When adjusted for inflation, the figures are overshadowed by a decline in investment in the rest of the economy.The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that inflation-adjusted investment in manufacturing facilities was a more modest $125 billion (annualized in the second quarter. Outside of manufacturing, investment in non-residential structures was $480 billion last quarter, down $90 billion from its peak in 2019.The long-term effects of Biden’s industrial policies are even less impressive. An analysis conducted by the Labor Energy Partnership, a strong supporter of Biden’s policies, said they would create 150,000 additional manufacturing jobs by 2030. That amounts to an increase of just 1.3% relative to the 13.1 million workers in employed in manufacturing right now. By comparison, the U.S. economy created 272,000 manufacturing jobs in 2018 alone.The administration hopes that by funneling its resources toward semiconductors and green energy, it can foster the growth of a manufacturing ecosystem that will ensure U.S. leadership in high-tech manufacturing. Research suggests otherwise.Analysts at the World Trade Organization summarize evidence this way: For economies in transition from undeveloped to developed, direct investment in manufacturing can indeed benefit domestic suppliers. For fully developed economies, however, direct investment has no benefits for either domestic suppliers or purchasers of manufacturing products. That’s because investors are already aware of what they have to offer, and capital markets can easily finance the creation of new industries if there is a strong business case for them.The president is no doubt sincere in his desire to revive U.S. manufacturing, and it’s tempting to look at the surge in reshoring as evidence that his administration’s policies are having a transformative effect. Yet even the most optimistic projections suggest that Biden’s industrial policy will have only a minor effect on U.S. manufacturing employment.KAILUA-KONA — Under beautiful sunny skies, cyclists gathered at the bottom of Kaloko Drive on August 18 for the annual Pedal Til Ya Puke 6.5-Mile Hill Climb, an event that has become synonymous with grit, endurance and sheer determination.Millions of sports fans tuning in to see U.S. Open tennis, a key National League East baseball game and one of the marquee matchups of college football’s opening weekend got an unwanted surprise Sunday night.

eugeneweekly_2023_13,"We ve got issues. I am a Christian and proud to call myself one. I attend church on Sunday and a Bible study and prayer group during the week. I am also chair of the First Congregational Church of Eugene’s Open and Affirming (ONA Work Group responsible for making sure our church is a safe, welcoming and affirming place for the non-binary LGBTQ folk to come, worship and openly be who they are. On August 12, KEZI did a story on the Eugene Pride in the Park Festival featuring an interview with Bryan Carver, a protester from Wellspring Bible Fellowship, based in Roseburg, who said, “Homosexuality is sin, and what’s being celebrated today is the kind of thing which God judges nations for,” and “We do not speak hate, we speak what we believe is the truth.” When he spoke of “God judging” and of “speaking the truth,” he gave the impression that he spoke for God and for all Christians, but he does not. He does not speak for me, the God I worship, or for the churches in Eugene who welcome and affirm nonbinary folk as they are and support their right to be who they are. I would not worship a God who disapproved of them for doing that. The protester must worship a different God than I do or be wrong about the God that he does worship. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. At the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC Convention, political commentator Michael Knowles told the crowd, “For the good of society… transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely — the whole preposterous ideology, at every level.” While Knowles subsequently claimed that eradicating “transgenderism” is not a call for eradicating transgender people, any time the word eradication occurs in the same sentence as a word that describes any group of people, alarm bells should go off, and they did. Transgender people are not an ideology or an “ism.” They are individual human beings who discover that they do not identify as their biological gender or the gender they were identified as at birth. Knowles is playing a dangerous game of semantics. He is trying to galvanize the Republican base by directing their hate and anger at something they do not understand. The LGBTQ community is under attack by those on the right as a means of stirring up their base of support. My church and many others in Eugene try to provide a safe place for these people to gather and be fully accepted and affirmed for who they are. Many Eugene area churches were present at Eugene Pride to show their support for the LGBTQ community but were not interviewed by KEZI so they could give that support voice. In addition to my own, First Christian Church, the Unitarian Universalist Church, Saint Mary’s Episcopal Church and Trinity Methodist all had booths or an organized presence. There may have been more. To the best of my knowledge, none of these churches worship a God who judges homosexuality to be a sin or feel a need to eradicate what Knowles labeled “transgenderism.” Contrary to what the protester claimed at Eugene Pride, he was preaching hate — hate against those in the LGBTQ community whom he fears and can’t understand. By labeling them an “ism” and ideology and calling for their eradication, Knowles, too, is preaching hate. I worship a God who knows me and loves me for who I am and does the same for all those in the LGBTQ community. I follow the man who told me that loving my neighbor as myself, even if that neighbor looks, thinks and acts differently than I do, is one of the two greatest commandments. I belong to one of many churches in Eugene that share my values and beliefs and fully support the LGBTQ community."
suffolknewsherald_2023_189,"Published 5:50 pm Tuesday, September 19, 2023ByJen JaquaSuffolk was all about business in 1989-90. In January of ’89, downtown property owners planning renovations to their buildings could qualify for the Suffolk Main Street Program’s Incentive Grant, awarded to revitalization projects having the largest impact on the downtown’s appearance.In the theme of business, the News-Herald did a continuing series on local businesses that bucked the trend In the takeover-happy business world — those that were (and still are family-owned and have spanned several generations. Some featured businesses were R.W. Baker and Company Funeral Home, Carter Furniture and Brandon House.“The term ‘undertaker’ most likely came about during the early 1800s as the men of the profession would generally undertake just about anything they were called upon to do. Robert Washington Baker, the founder of R.W. Baker and Company Funeral Home, is a good example. In 1971, Robert N. Baker III joined the 104-year-old R.W. Baker and Company Funeral Home. He was the fourth generation of his family to be licensed by the Virginia Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers.”It took Thomas Carter Sr. 30 years to save the $15,000 he needed to go into the furniture business for himself. He was 49 years old when he opened his first store. In 1985, Carter’s Warehouse and Showroom was opened across the street from the Quality Shop. Third-generation Donnie Carter runs that store. Carter and Son Furniture was eventually turned over to Carolyn and David Brandon Carter. “The name of the store was changed to Brandon House after David’s middle name,” said Don. “They are our biggest competitor in the quality furniture business.”Shannon Michelle Johnson was selected as a congressional page in August of 1989 to serve Fourth District Congressman Norman Sisisky. Shannon had her future planned — she had her eyes on the office of Deputy Commonwealth’s Attorney. She said she was studying theater arts because she planned on entering law school to study law and political science.A month later, a follow-up ran — the 15-year-old had plans to follow in the footsteps of Nancy Parr, the current Deputy Commonwealth’s Attorney. “When Parr read Johnson’s comments, she decided to check out the ‘heir apparent’ by inviting her to lunch. ‘She told me that she’d seen the article (in the Suffolk News-Herald , and then whenever she introduced me to anyone the rest of the day, she told them, ‘This is the person who wants my job,’’ said Johnson.”Along with business came roads. In October 1989, travelers down Bridge Road (Route 17 in Suffolk could see the beginnings of the work for Interstate 664, connecting Bowers Hill in Chesapeake with Belleville in Suffolk. The interstate was scheduled to open in August 1991.1990 saw a wave of educational facilities changes. “I’ll be here at the beginning, and I’ll be here at the end,” said John Yeates High School Principal William Whitley. Whitley retired in June after 25 years of service at John Yeates and 33 years of service to the Suffolk public school system. The high school will convert to a middle school next year. “I will have been here the whole time that John Yeates was a high school,” said Whitley. “Ms. (Ann Johnson and I are the only two people who can say that we’ve had something to do with every student who has come through John Yeates High School.”After a three-year absence, Christian education returned to Suffolk in the fall when Norfolk Christian Schools opened a branch of its operation on the former Suffolk Christian School site.In September, Lakeland and Nansemond River high schools opened. The subsequent changes with the former high school and middle schools resulted in rapid rezoning throughout the city. It resulted in almost every school receiving students from different areas. Whether they rode the bus or drove their cars, high school students spent their first day adjusting to the new facilities.The end of the millennium had people begin thinking healthier. The Virginia Indoor Clean Air Act, which took effect July 1, prohibited smoking in certain public places and restricted it in others. Any person smoking in a nonsmoking area who continued after being warned was subject to a $25 fine.August brought life to a weather-damaged tree. Clarence E. Harrell decided to carve a totem pole out of a 120-year-old cedar tree in his front yard to remain close to his Native American roots. All the carving he has done on the totem pole was done using a chainsaw. He started work at the top of the tree and used ropes and tree spikes to support himself. It took him nearly one day to complete the top figure, a bear, and three hours to complete an eagle just below it. Both figures had double facings which looked out on both directions of Desert Road.

suffolknewsherald_2023_58,"Published 5:36 pm Friday, April 28, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardPerhaps a unanimous ruling from the Virginia Supreme Court will get the attention of the Suffolk School Board and Superintendent John Gordon III.Let the record show once and for all that the rights of citizens to observe their government in action is not limited to friends of the elected and appointed officials conducting the public’s business. It applies to your “enemies” as well.The state’s high court has ruled unanimously in upholding a circuit judge’s ruling that the School Board violated the Virginia Freedom of Information Act in 2021 by prohibiting Deborah Wahlstrom from attending a strategic planning and training retreat.After Wahlstrom was told she’d have to watch the meeting remotely by video feed and she correctly asserted her right to be present, Gordon declared her “an enemy of the school division” and had police escort her from the premises.The board’s and Gordon’s fundamental ignorance of FOIA law, and pride that prevented them from acknowledging their mistakes, has cost taxpayers dearly during a time when public education needs all of the financial resources it can get.“As the trial court found, it was not room size, logistics or COVID precautions that prevented Wahlstrom from attending the meeting in person in the meeting room; it was the fact that, prior to the meeting, the Board decided to deny the public free entry to the meeting room,” Justice Wesley G.

suffolknewsherald_2023_166,"Published 4:38 pm Tuesday, January 3, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardWhile the staggering inflation of 2022 has begun to subside, Virginia’s working families are still feeling the pinch of strained household budgets.Two changes this week will help at least a little.Effective Sunday, the state’s 1.5% sales tax on groceries was eliminated and the minimum wage for workers rose a dollar, or 9%, to $12 per hour.The grocery tax cut, which also applies to some essential personal hygiene products, was the result of compromise during the 2022 General Assembly session between Senate Democrats and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who wanted to eliminate all grocery taxes, including a 1% tax that goes to localities.The local tax remains intact.Cutting the state’s portion of the grocery tax, originally proposed by former Gov. Ralph Northam, will mean roughly $7 million less for state government’s coffers. That’s a small price to pay for needed relief for low-income Virginians. The state might not even miss the money, as other tax collections continue to comfortably exceed projections.The $12 minimum wage is another notch in a law passed by legislative Democrats and Northam in 2020, when Virginia joined 29 other states setting minimum wages above the federal minimum wage of $7.25.The minimum wage could continue rising to $13.50 on Jan 1. 2025, and $15 on Jan. 1, 2026, but that would require approval by this year’s General Assembly and Youngkin..The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 329,000 to 364,000 Virginians with full-time, full-year jobs had wages less than $12 an hour prior to this week’s change. Many workers making more than $12 will see increases as wage scales are adjusted in the private sector.While a 1.5% grocery tax reduction and $1 increase in the minimum wage might seem like small gestures, every little bit helps.The fundamental responsibility of feeding one’s family has pushed many people to the breaking point. Those who live paycheck to paycheck even in “good” times find themselves on the verge of food insecurity.The grocery tax is a rare, and welcomed, product of bipartisan consensus in polarized Richmond. We hope to see more compromise in 2023.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B. Ballard Stadium, the Old Dominion Monarchs will host…The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

leoweekly_2023_42,"Today’s LEO Weekly readers would not recognize much of the first issue of what was then called simply “LEO,” published 33 years ago. There’s one name they would recognize, however: Denny Crum, the University of Louisville icon who passed away last week at the age of 86.When I decided to start a new publication in 1990, I faced the challenge of establishing instant credibility, because I didn’t have the resources to build an audience over a long period of time. I knew the Louisville community was ready for an alternative weekly because those publications were thriving all around the country.Another thing had happened here; the Courier-Journal had been sold to Gannett, and several of the paper’s prominent writers had decided to retire. My plan was to recruit some of them as contributing writers and to give them an ownership interest in the paper. Bob Schulman, Mary Caldwell and Dudley Saunders are names few current Louisvillians would remember, but my final recruit was to be Denny Crum, who I knew could attract readers across the community.Denny and I had formed a friendship that went back to the mid-1970’s. It actually started after I had written an article in 1976 about the three incoming Louisville Cardinal basketball players, Darrell Griffith, Bobby Turner, and Tony Branch. Through them I met Denny, and a long relationship followed. I knew, from many hours spent with him, that he never said “no” to a request, not just from a friend, but from anyone who approached him.When I proposed to Denny that he join our small stable of writers, he naturally mentioned that he was not a writer, which I knew, and when I told him that I would be his ghostwriter, he readily accepted the invitation. So for several years, Denny and I would discuss ideas for his columns and I would try to execute them in his voice. To this day I don’t know whether people liked my interpretation of Coach’s ideas, but I know that many people picked up LEO (of course, it wasn’t available digitally at the time, only at about 400 businesses around town because they wanted to see what he had on his mind.In any event, while it didn’t make it into the other tributes to Coach Crum, he was a founding contributor and part-owner of the publication you are reading now.Of course, his role with LEO was not high on his list of accomplishments, and, in fact, I would say it wasn’t the only way he affected my life in a consequential way. Importantly, he converted me from my then life-long Wildcats love to an avid Cardinals supporter.More consequentially, in late 1982, I was pondering the next step in my life when I traveled with the team to the Great Alaska Shootout, a pre-season event held in Anchorage. One night at dinner with Denny and a U of L vice-president named Steve Bing, Denny suggested that I might work at the University. Bing then mentioned he would be hiring an assistant vice-president to handle university communications. Several months later I was serving in that role, and I spent a wonderful three years on campus in good times and bad, promoting the institution.Lives rarely proceed in a logical pattern, but it’s fair to say that my years at U of L led to my founding of LEO, and LEO ultimately led to a race for Congress and the 16-year political career that I just concluded.Denny Crum was a Republican and self-identified conservative, but he was about as apolitical as anyone I ever met. If I had ever engaged him in a political discussion, however, I would have argued vociferously that he was actually pretty liberal. I believe that because of his compassion for every person he encountered, and for the many hours he gave to people and organizations whose role was to balance much of the unfairness in American society.Denny would not want me to write about his politics, so I will go no further, but I will repeat what many have said in these sad days since he left us. Denny Crum had a heart the size of a basketball, the competitive spirit of a gladiator, and he was more loyal to his players, his friends, his community and his university than the many dogs he cherished were loyal to him. He was a champion in every sense of the word.*** ."
eugeneweekly_2023_44,"We ve got issues. The Eugene City Council will be voting April 10 on a proposal that will decide which rural land will next be covered with urban sprawl.This proposal is about the urban reserves. The city is attempting to put rural land into the urban reserves that is more than two miles beyond the current urban growth boundary (UGB at the southwest corner of the city. This land contains the last best stands of oak woodlands in our area, including trees that are hundreds of years old. Oak woodlands have already been 97 percent destroyed in the Willamette Valley. The urban reserves proposal does not comply with Oregon’s Statewide Land Use Planning Goal 5 regarding wildlife habitat. Specifically, at least eight wildlife species that have been designated as Sensitive Species by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife have been found in the area of the proposed urban reserves, and at least three of these breed there. Most of these species are associated with or dependent on oak woodland habitat, but neither the species nor their habitats have been inventoried as required for compliance with Goal 5. In the early 1990s, when Eugene was growing west into another endangered ecosystem, the wet prairie wetland habitat, Eugene took a bold, innovative and comprehensive approach to wetland conservation and development with the West Eugene Wetland Plan. The City Council could uphold Eugene’s reputation for foresight and conservation by completing a detailed inventory of all the oak woodlands in the path of development and determining their value by type, size, connectivity, biodiversity, presence of rare species and land-use history. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Unlike wetlands, oak woodlands take a long time to grow and don’t produce acorns until they are at least 20 years old. If existing, mature oak woodlands are destroyed and new ones are planted elsewhere at the same time, acorn woodpeckers and other wildlife species that are dependent on oak woodlands cannot just wait around for decades while the new oak trees grow. Actually, the city of Eugene did fund a multi-year study of oak woodlands and was a signatory partner in the resulting 30-year conservation plan published in March 2020. The Willamette Valley Oak and Prairie Cooperative Strategic Action Plan directly contradicts the Urban Reserves 27-year proposal by mapping a Core Conservation Area in what is also the biggest area for development in the urban reserves plan. The city can’t have it both ways. This oak conservation plan was never discussed on the urban reserves website, at any of the public meetings, or at the work sessions. Oak woodland protection cannot be postponed until the city is actually trying to extend the UGB. At a recent work session, the councilors were told by staff that the urban reserves proposal already contains enough information about the land to bring it into the UGB quickly without doing any more inventory or analysis. Those who supported the middle housing plan to increase density in order to protect nearby farms and natural areas should speak up now, because the Eugene City Council is trying to have it both ways: increased density and urban sprawl. Please contact the council before April 10 atmayorcouncilandcitymanager@eugene-or.gov Sharon Blick has lived in the Eugene area for 37 years. She holds a masters degree in ecology and served as education coordinator for the Mount Pisgah Arboretum, founder of Nearby Nature and executive director for the School Garden Project. She was a leader in the initiative campaign which created the Whilamut Natural Area in East Alton Baker Park in 1992 and served on the Citizens Planning Committee to create the plan for this area. For the past 15 years, she has operated the Living Earth Farm just west of Eugene which includes valuable oak woodland habitat."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_4,"It makes perfect sense to treat Donald Trump as the most immediate threat to the future of American democracy. He has an ambitious plan to turn the office of the presidency into an instrument of “revenge” against his political enemies and other supposedly undesirable groups.But while we keep our eyes on Trump and his allies and enablers, it is also important not to lose sight of the fact that antidemocratic attitudes run deep within the Republican Party. In particular, there appears to be a view among many Republicans that the only vote worth respecting is a vote for the party and its interests. A vote against them is a vote that doesn’t count.This is not a new phenomenon. We saw a version of it on at least two occasions in 2018. In Florida, a nearly two-thirds majority of voters backed a state constitutional amendment to effectively end felon disenfranchisement. The voters of Florida were as clear as voters could possibly be: If you’ve served your time, you deserve your ballot.Rather than heed the voice of the people, Florida Republicans immediately set out to render it moot. They passed, and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed, a bill that more or less nullified the amendment by imposing an almost impossible set of requirements for former felons to meet. Specifically, eligible voters had to pay any outstanding fees or fines that were on the books before their rights could be restored. Except there was no central record of those fees or fines, and the state did not have to tell former felons what they owed, if anything. You could try to vote, but you risked arrest, conviction and even jail time.In Wisconsin, that same year, voters put Tony Evers, a Democrat, into the governor’s mansion, breaking eight years of Republican control. The Republican-led Legislature did not have the power to overturn the election results, but the impenetrable, ultra-gerrymandered majority could use its authority to strip as much power from the governor as possible, blocking, among other things, his ability to withdraw from a state lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act — one of the things he campaigned on. Wisconsin voters would have their new governor, but he’d be as weak as Republicans could possibly make him.It almost goes without saying that we should include the former president’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election as another example of the willingness of the Republican Party to reject any electoral outcome that doesn’t fall in its favor. And although we’ve only had a few elections this year, it doesn’t take much effort to find more of the same.I’ve already written about the attempt among Wisconsin Republicans to nullify the results of a heated race for a seat on the state Supreme Court. Voters overwhelmingly backed the more liberal candidate for the seat, Janet Protasiewicz, giving the court the votes needed to overturn the gerrymander that keeps Wisconsin Republicans in power in the Legislature even after they lose a majority of votes statewide.In response, Wisconsin Republicans floated an effort to impeach the new justice on a trumped-up charge of bias. The party eventually backed down in the face of national outrage — and the danger that any attempt to remove Protasiewicz might backfire electorally in the future. But the party’s reflexive move to attempt to cancel the will of the electorate says everything you need to know about the relationship of the Wisconsin Republican Party to democracy.Ohio Republicans seem to share the same attitude toward voters who choose not to back Republican priorities. As in Wisconsin, the Ohio Legislature is so gerrymandered in favor of the Republican Party that it would take a once-in-a-century supermajority of Democratic votes to dislodge it from power. Most lawmakers in the state have nothing to fear from voters who might disagree with their actions.It was in part because of this gerrymander that abortion rights proponents in the state focused their efforts on a ballot initiative. The Ohio Legislature may have been dead set on ending abortion access in the state — in 2019, the Republican majority passed a so-called heartbeat bill banning abortion after six weeks — but Ohio voters were not.Aware that most of the voters in their state supported abortion rights, and unwilling to try to persuade them that an abortion ban was the best policy for the state, Ohio Republicans first tried to rig the game. In August, the Legislature asked voters to weigh in on a new supermajority requirement for ballot initiatives to amend the State Constitution. If approved, this requirement would have stopped the abortion rights amendment in its tracks.It failed. And last week, Ohioans voted overwhelmingly to write reproductive rights into their state Constitution, repudiating their gerrymandered, anti-choice legislature. Or so they thought.Not one full day after the vote, four Republican state representatives announced that they intended to do everything in their power to nullify the amendment and give lawmakers total discretion to ban abortion as they see fit. “This initiative failed to mention a single, specific law,” their statement reads. “We will do everything in our power to prevent our laws from being removed upon perception of intent. We were elected to protect the most vulnerable in our state, and we will continue that work.”Notice the language: “our power” and “our laws.” There is no awareness here that the people of Ohio are sovereign and that their vote to amend the State Constitution holds greater authority than the judgment of a small group of legislators. This group may not like the fact that Ohioans have declared the Republican abortion ban null and void, but that is democracy. If these lawmakers want to advance their efforts to restrict abortion, they first need to persuade the people.To many Republicans, unfortunately, persuasion is anathema. There is no use making an argument since you might lose. Instead, the game is to create a system in which, heads or tails, you always win.That’s why Republican legislatures across the country have embraced partisan gerrymanders so powerful that they undermine the claim to democratic government in the states in question.That’s why Republicans in places like North Carolina have adopted novel and dubious legal arguments about state power, the upshot of which is that they concentrate power in the hands of these gerrymandered state legislatures, giving them total authority over elections and electoral outcomes. And that’s why, months before voting begins in the Republican presidential contest, much of the party has already embraced a presidential candidate who promises to prosecute and persecute his political opponents.One of the basic ideas of democracy is that nothing is final. Defeats can become victories and victories can become defeats. Governments change, laws change, and, most important, the people change. No majority isthemajority, and there’s always the chance that new configurations of groups and interests will produce new outcomes.For this to work, however, we — as citizens — have to believe it can work. Cultivating this faith is no easy task. We have to have confidence in our ability to talk to one another, to work with one another, to persuade one another. We have to see one another, in some sense, as equals, each of us entitled to a place in this society.It seems to me that too many Republicans have lost that faith.© 2023 The New York Times Company"
suffolknewsherald_2023_23,"Published 4:29 pm Tuesday, June 13, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldHampton Roads residential real estate values continue to sizzle.The median sales price of homes sold in the region reached a record high of $335,000 in May, topping the prior record of $329,000 in May 2022, according to the Real Estate Information Network, the leading provider of real estate data in Hampton Roads.The MSP, as it’s called in real estate jargon, increased nearly 5% from April to May, reaching a record high of $335,000 for the region.Tight inventory heading into the summer months means values aren’t likely to cool anytime soon.Many consumers who might otherwise choose to sell their homes appear unwilling to do so, as both home prices and mortgage rates are higher than they have been in recent years, according to Jon McAchran, president of REIN’s Board of Directors.“Even with mortgage rates up and the price of homes higher, people are buying,” he said. “If there was more inventory, consumers might be more likely to find the home they need, regardless of the price.”Month’s Supply of Inventory (MSI is a calculation of how long there would be homes on the market if no new inventory was added. For May, the number was 1.37. Typically, a market is considered “healthy” if the MSI is between 5.0-7.0 months of supply. Since January 2021, the highest the MSI has been in Hampton Roads was 1.47 in July 2021.“Needless to say, it has been a seller’s market in Hampton Roads for a number of years, and prices are likely to remain high until inventory increases again,” said McAchran.Some other data of interest from REIN:Normally, we’d say this is a good time to sell your home and cash out on record values.

suffolknewsherald_2023_234,"Published 5:13 pm Tuesday, July 25, 2023ByJen JaquaIn 1975 and ’76, the new city of Suffolk was growing and developing quickly. With the economy recovering, residents looked to the future for new shopping and entertainment options. In February 1975, a petition calling for the city to establish additional recreational facilities, in particular a bowling alley or skating rink, was signed by more than 500 residents and presented to City Council.While the economy was recovering, grocery prices and gas prices were still high.“Fast food servers ranging from 7-Eleven with its “Hamlet” to Stuckey’s and Hardee’s with a variety of hot breakfasts are expanding horizons at sunrise and finding a good market for breakfast offerings here. Not only fast food specialists but most area restaurants report an increase in the demand for breakfast. In explaining the trend, many restaurant managers cited the increases in prices of groceries for preparing breakfast at home. Bacon, eggs, coffee and toast costs an estimated 50 cents to prepare at home. “Breakfast out” averages $1.10 and generally tastes better. Some managers noted that more working women and more women who prefer to sleep in rather than cook their husband’s breakfast helped boost the morning trade.”The mid-’70s saw women striving for equal rights nationwide, and here in Suffolk was no different. In April 1975, a group of women — and men — began to organize a women’s rights group in Suffolk. Lower pay, poor job opportunities and general lack of respect for women on an equal level with men were the major obstacles the participants wanted to overcome. Criticism of city government centered on the lack of women in positions of responsibility, including department heads.On Oct. 29, 1975, America’s women were asked to cancel all normal activities — work, shopping, banking, cooking, child care and even sex — as part of a nationwide feminist strike to show the system how much it depends on them. The one-day strike, known as “Alice Doesn’t,” was called by the National Organization for Women in hopes that “everything will stop in this country” without the services of thousands of striking homemakers, businesswomen and even prostitutes. The strike took its name from the motion picture “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.”The July 4 holiday has always been occasion for gas to be more expensive, and it was no different in 1975, as prices soared to 60 cents a gallon.At the end of 1975, the Suffolk Planning Commission got its first look at the land use plan being formulated by the Kidd and Associates consulting firm. That plan, actually a series of maps supported by documentation, was used in the next six months as the basis of a new zoning ordinance which was used to reclassify land throughout the city. Probably the most radical change in thinking reflected in the land use plan was that much more growth was projected for the northern portion of the city than was previously thought.“John Kidd, president of Kidd and Associates, an Atlanta, based firm which also designed the city’s Community Facilities Plan, pointed to increased subdivision activity in that area as a sign of the projected growth. He added that if Interstate 664, the third crossing of the James River, is ever completed, the areas surrounding its interchanges will be ripe for growth, both in the way of housing and commercial establishments.”Kidd’s maps showed the urban development areas of Driver, Bennetts Creek and Crittenden-Eclipse-Hobson as the areas to receive the most growth. The intersections of Bennetts Pasture Road, Shoulders Hill Road, and 1-664 with Route 17 were all designated as areas of commercial growth.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2023_39,"We like it when you talk to us, even if you’re upset. This space is for you. Sometimes, we talk back.Mind you that at age 14, I was an unannounced atheist to spare my evangelical grandparents the trauma of knowing their grandson was a heathen and I knew perfectly well that my mother would have fornicated with father Thomas in front of the entire congregation if she had the chance but *I* was there strictly for the coffee and eclairs. You had to be fast on the eclairs if you hoped to get one because those blue-haired Grendels were on them like flies on you know what.Father Thomas was an extremely attractive man with fabulously quaffed hair. He looked like a hair model but when he said, ‘all evil eventually dies yet the Lord remains,’ I could not contain my hysterical nature and audibly scoffed in front of everyone. The next thing I felt was my mother’s heel digging into the top of my foot because if she had had a meat cleaver or baseball bat, I would have been a former human at that moment.To appreciate this next series of moments you must know that at 13 years-old, my mother informed me and anyone living in the surrounding five counties that I was a ‘son of a bitch.’Naturally and of course I retorted, ‘you just called yourself a bitch.’My mother was not one to ever employ corporeal punishment but there were rare exceptions and this was once of them. Her favorite implement to spank me with was the Wooden Spoon of Destiny. It had a thin handle and a broad head for maximum coverage and I do remember her repeating to me many times that she had bought her ‘collection’ in Amsterdam and that she was quite fond of said spoons which had fallen pray to the dishwasher gremlins over the years to the point where she once announced to me and my sisters, ‘if any of you dumb sons of bitches ever put one of my wooden spoons in the effin dishwasher again, you’re gonna get it.’We all knew what that meant but I was the only one who didn’t care.Mom of course was incensed that I had mocked her which wasn’t true, she had mocked herself and pointing that out to her did not make her shall we say, ‘happier.’ She was angry, very angry which made it that much funnier to me. I wasn’t particularly shy about laughing as she summoned the Spoon of Destiny.She had to tell me to ‘turn over’ for this classic ass-whippin to commence.“I didn’t call you a bitch! YOU DID!”Now I know what you’re thinking, it was not wise to incense my mother to that particular point where she would have ended my life but you don’t know wooden spoons like *I* know wooden spoons, especially those garbage Dutch kind.She got in one good whack as I felt the Spoon of Destiny snap in half and tumble into the bathtub. I couldn’t stop laughing which enraged her even more.‘Goddamnit you little shit! You just broke my favorite spoon!’She gave me one more swat with her hand on the behind before recoiling in pain.I turned to hug her and said, ‘it’s okay Vern, I won’t let you call me a dumb son of a bitch again.’ Then I kissed her hurt hand as she whimpered in pain.Afterwards we’d go out and see groups of wooden spoons for sale and I’d say, ‘these ones are made in America so they’ll last longer’ and that’s when she informed me that I was also a bastard.‘Thomas, I heard you scoff during my sermon today, was there something you wanted to share with me?’My foot was still smarting a bit and those old bags got to the eclairs before I did so I was in a pissy mood despite my mother giving me the look of death, ‘Actually father, about that comment about evil dying, I just thought I’d remind you that H.R. Haldeman and Henry Kissinger are still alive so there goes your theory about evil dying while the Lord remains.’My mom had long forgotten about corporeal punishment but it was at this exact moment that she discovered what a conniption fit was. I could almost see her skull come unhinged and split in half as fire shot from the top of her head. I wasn’t sure if she wanted to castrate me, kill me or both but with hindsight, I think both is the answer.She wanted to fight me because she still had the hots for Father Thomas who was married and she might have cracked my skull open if she had a bat to do so but the more pressing problem for her was that she knew I was right. She also knew this was the end of her hopeful dalliance with Father Thomas. We never returned to church again.I remember reading the books on Winston Churchill and even the ones he wrote, The Last Lion and A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, and I was quite taken as a teen with him being such a monumental man but then I read the books of real historians who made it too clear that Churchill was a genocidal, racist and incorrigible thief.I felt the same about Kissinger, too, before I bothered to read the less illuminating history of that bastard. My father didn’t know what a bastard he was, and neither did a lot of the people on the planet before tidbits of classified material started coming out to show what an impossibly drunk-on-power sadist he was who indiscriminately killed hundreds of thousands of Laotians who never did a damn thing to America.Neither did Vietnam for that matter, and the Nobel Committee soiled itself by giving that amoral scumbag the Nobel Prize for ‘ending’ the Vietnam War. Saying Kissinger tried to ‘end’ the Vietnam War is like saying you turned a lion into a vegetarian.He killed as many in Cambodia, and now that I live in Southeast Asia, I appreciate the grotesque obscenity that the Nobel Committee soiled itself with forever because nobody in the damn Pentagon had ever bothered to read a book about the history of Southeast Asia before they concocted the Gulf of Tonkin incident that never happened.It was merely the figment of imagination from some assholes in the Pentagon who were never tried at the Hague for Crimes Against Humanity and the first person who should have been tried on their list is Henry Kissinger.Several historians have tried to keep account of how many people died because of Henry Kissinger’s megalomaniacal evildoing and the best guess anyone has put together is between two and three million. That includes women and children.Kissinger’s evil spread all over the globe into Chile, where he instructed Pinochet that if he had to do ‘things’ they needed to be done quickly. The ‘things’ he was talking about was the murder of 30,000 people.There was also a similar edict to Suharto of Indonesia who liquidated the island of East Timor which killed another 100,000 people.Kissinger was a Harvard graduate and professor but he, like the other troglodytes running the Pentagon, never bothered to learn that the Vietnamese *hated* the Chinese, and would never fall for communism. That goes for Laos and Cambodia as well. A Harvard-trained professor and national security advisor never bothered to read a single history book about Southeast Asia before getting 50,000 American soldiers killed here for absolutely nothing.The Vietnam War accomplished nothing but establishing the United States as War Criminals and how that lying sack of shit gets to hobnob around the planet with Hillary and the Bilderberg Group like he is someone to be listened to makes me physically ill.Father Thomas died from cancer about 30 years ago and today Henry Kissinger turns 100 years-old.So on days like today, I want to ask Father Thomas, ‘where the fuck is the Lord?’ ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_125,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In my fifth year at UH Hilo, I am finally accomplishing one of my personal goals: studying Hawaiian language. I have studied languages my whole life. My mother bought some Spanish language records for me while I was in grade school. That was followed by Spanish, French, and German study in high school, more Spanish and Portuguese during study abroad trips, and dabbling in Catalan, Greek and Russian as an undergraduate, with more serious study of Arabic, Farsi, and Latin in graduate school.In my fifth year at UH Hilo, I am finally accomplishing one of my personal goals: studying Hawaiian language. I have studied languages my whole life. My mother bought some Spanish language records for me while I was in grade school. That was followed by Spanish, French, and German study in high school, more Spanish and Portuguese during study abroad trips, and dabbling in Catalan, Greek and Russian as an undergraduate, with more serious study of Arabic, Farsi, and Latin in graduate school.Like working out, language study has to be regular and consistent to be useful, and I have forgotten a lot of what I have studied merely because I have not taken the opportunity to practice. That should not be a problem with Hawaiian, as I find more and more words finding their way into my everyday speech.Languages reflect people’s experiences. We used to joke in Arabic class about how many words have a secondary meaning about something to do with a camel. If you are going to cross desert regions on a camel, after all, you are going to have words for every piece of that beast and every piece of the saddle, reins, etc. Similarly, in Native Alaskan languages there are many words and phrases for snow, and, of course, in Hawaiian, there are many words and phrases to describe types of rain, of which we have seen a lot these last couple of weeks.Languages also reflect history. Twenty percent of the Spanish language has its roots in Arabic because of the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula in the Middle Ages. In Hawaiian we see words with roots in English, such as paikikala (bicycle in which the English “b” converts to “p” and “c” converts to “k” as there were no bicycles in the pre-contact era that makes sense. Tracing back further, the English cycle comes from the Greek kuklos; so in the long story of the bicycle, the “k” became a “c,” which reverted to a “k” when it came into Hawaiian.Clearly I could go on about this for a lot longer then the length of this column, but I’ll just add that languages also reflect what is important to their people. In Hawaiian, there are a number of words for family relationships because family is such a very important foundation for community.Yesterday, I was witness, as I am every year about this time, to the dual importance of language and family during the UH Hilo commencement exercises. As a Hawaiian-serving institution, the Hawaiian language permeates our ceremony: a part of my remarks is in Hawaiian, our school chant is the “Ua Ao Hawai‘i” and after we sing the “Star Spangled Banner,” we sing “Hawai‘i Pono‘i.” I always enjoy hearing so many of our students, faculty, staff, and families chiming in on the Hawaiian songs as well as the English ones. One day I hope to be fluent in both. This bilingual ceremony demonstrates our respect for our community and the university’s role in the Hawaiian language movement.Seeing the gym filled with families and friends always warms my heart. Some have tears in their eyes when their student crosses the stage, some cheer, some just clap. All are proud of their student’s accomplishments and happy that this day has (in some cases, finally come. All of those family relationships are represented somewhere in the audience: parents, grandparents, siblings, spouses, in-laws, aunties and uncles.Each student gets a limited number of tickets, and each chooses who will attend the ceremony. We know, however, that behind each student is an even larger group of people, parents and friends, to be sure, but also teachers and counselors, siblings and cousins, scholarship donors and employers, and all the many people who work in our community to support the journey each student makes.One of the first words one learns in Hawaiian is ‘ohana, and much like the word aloha, we need to grasp the full meaning of the word to really understand it. The ‘ohana that surrounds each of our students can encompass a whole village of people, and like our students, we are grateful for their presence today and always.Bonnie D. Irwin is chancellor of the University of Hawaii at Hilo. Her column appears monthly in the Tribune-Herald.OTTAWA — Canada’s two main freight rail companies are set to lock out around 10,000 of their Canadian unionized workers on Thursday at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT , starting an unprecedented simultaneous work stoppage that would grind almost all railway freight movement in the country to a halt.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser."

eugeneweekly_2023_8,"We ve got issues. When people think of Eugene, they often think of hippies with moss growing out of their backs, wet, verdant old-growth forests and a community tucked away under an omnipresent blanket of mist. Yet, as this most recent heat wave and fire season have reminded us, that old vision of Eugene scarcely continues to exist (though the hippies are still around . While the past few summers have been the hottest our city has experienced in recorded history, the harrowing truth of our warming climate is that they are also destined to be some of the coolest summers we will see again in our lifetimes. The reality of our “new normal” is that yesterday’s solutions provide no answers to today’s and tomorrow’s problems. To truly address the climate crisis, we need to mitigate its worst impacts by eliminating our greenhouse gas emissions. The science is clear that this necessitates a full transition off of fossil fuels, on an unprecedentedly rapid timeline. Equally importantly, we need to invest in community resilience. Above all, we need to ensure that false solutions are rejected, and that no sections of the community are left behind in the energy transition. Experts have shown that we can achieve this vision, but doing so requires an all-hands-on-deck approach, with stakeholders all moving rapidly in the same direction. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. For this reason, climate advocates in Eugene have grown increasingly frustrated with our customer-owned utility, Eugene Water and Electric Board (EWEB . Despite being at the helm of a utility with one of the least emissions-intensive energy mixes in the country, EWEB has found itself stuck in the past, becoming an unwitting partner of Northwest Natural’s attempts to lock-in fossil fuel infrastructure infrastructure and cast doubt about an all-electric future powered by renewable energy. This includes the utility getting wrapped up in NW Natural’s now-abandoned hydrogen blending project in the Bethel neighborhood, which would have increased air quality issues and explosion risks for Bethel’s residents, for marginal emissions reductions, at an incredible cost. EWEB’s recent Integrated Resource Plan (IRP has continued this concerning trend, particularly in the ways that its results have been communicated publicly. We question, for example, why most of EWEB’s media outreach around the IRP has focused on the demand challenges posed by electrification, and the potential need for generation from biomass or small modular nuclear reactors. As Lawson himself acknowledged in his August 3 op-ed in this newspaper’s online edition, these resources would only be needed only in higher-demand scenarios, and by the time they are needed other firm resources such as geothermal could be cost-competitive. Similarly, EWEB’s framing of electrification as only a burden on our grid overlooks the potential of heat-pump retrofits, especially when combined with weatherization upgrades, to reduce grid load by replacing less-efficient electric resistance heating. EWEB should be championing electrification and leading on devising innovative load management solutions, not touting false energy solutions. For this reason, 40 organizations recently submitted a public letter to EWEB, calling for the board to take three concrete steps to bring our utility into the 21st century, and to create a roadmap for a just transition that other utilities and local governments can follow. First, EWEB should partner with local community organizations and labor unions to build publicly owned renewable energy generation capacity. Community ownership of electricity generation, built by union labor, is central to securing a truly just energy transition. Second, EWEB must expand existing incentives for electrification and distributed solar to drive adoption and increase access to these common sense solutions. EWEB already has strong programs in place, but there is the potential to further improve access to high efficiency appliances such as heat pumps, and remove barriers to homes installing localized solar that will reduce emissions and increase climate resilience. Third, as our community transitions to 100 percent clean electricity, we must put in place protections to ensure that it is affordable and accessible to all. EWEB must increase its woefully underfunded bill assistance program, specifically by reducing costs for qualifying households by 50 percent, increasing enrollment through self-verification, and automatic enrolling households currently participating in state and federal low-income support programs. A community-owned utility like EWEB should reflect community values. Because it already enjoys an over 90 percent decarbonized energy mix, achieving full decarbonization is much less daunting for EWEB than it is for other regional utilities. EWEB therefore has an incredible opportunity before it to demonstrate genuine climate leadership, by delivering a 100 percent emissions-free grid with non-polluting resources. By continuing to headline nuclear and biomass, we fear EWEB is shirking from its responsibility to deliver a truly just transition and provide the foundation to a climate-resilient community. Committing to the goals outlined in our recent letter to EWEB above would serve as an important course correction, and we call on EWEB’s Board of Commissioners to take these steps."
eugeneweekly_2023_68,"We ve got issues. On this week of Thanksgiving, I want to share the Center for Rural Livelihoods’ statement on settler colonialism, which includes us insisting on a lasting ceasefire and a free Palestine. Many groups and institutions are doing land acknowledgements, and we are building on that to look at the process of settler colonialism, which plays out in locales across the globe over the past few centuries. The statement is below. Perhaps organizations you know will want to adopt it. But before that, I want to share what I learned at the Applegate House in Yoncalla on Nov. 20 The Center for Rural Livelihoods is currently sharing a group of AmeriCorps volunteers with Komemma Cultural Protection Association (KCPA . The AmeriCorps team spends three days per week at KCPA and 2 days per week at the Center for Rural Livelihoods. KCPA has been undertaking an ambitious 207 acre land rematriation project in Yoncalla. There is a ton of work to do on the KCPA land, but the leaders of KCPA asked the AmeriCorps team to spend one of their valuable workdays at the Applegate House. What is that? Why is that important? How is it related to settler colonialism? The Applegates made it over the Oregon Trail in the 1840s. They were middle class, opposed slavery and couldn’t compete with local slave-holding businesses in Missouri. Upon arrival in what is now Yoncalla, they sent out smoke signals to contact the local inhabitants. Charles Applegate spokeChinuukjargon and could communicate with the local Komemma band of Kalapuya Indians. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. A local leader named Camafeema came to meet with them. The Applegates asked Camafeema for permission to settle there. Camafeema said yes, showed them the local spring and a nearby camping area. The Komemma band taught the Applegates about Doug-fir tea, medicinal uses of chokeberry bark and shared other local knowledge. Their relationship points to a historical trajectory that was snuffed out by grander historical forces at the time. In the 1850s, the U.S. government rounded up Native Americans in Oregon Territory and forced them onto reservations. The Applegates helped members of the Komemma band evade the round up, and the relationship continued through the generations. The great-great-granddaughters of both Charles Applegate and Camafeema work together today. Shannon Applegate, the great-great-granddaughter of Charles Applegate, showed CRL staff and the AmeriCorps crew around their historic rural house earlier this week. Esther Stutzman, the great-great-granddaughter of Camafeema is the director of the Komemma Cultural Protection Association and for many years served as the chair of the board of directors of the Applegate House. Stutzman and Applegate collaborated on a program called“Two-eyed Seeing”that teaches about the differences and similarities between Indigenous and settler approaches. Settler colonialism stands in contrast to these respectful and reciprocal inter-generational relationships. The land we are on is Indigenous land taken by settlers and governments in an ongoing process understood as settler colonialism. We recognize that settler colonialism involves stealing resources and uprooting Indigenous peoples. We acknowledge that settler colonialism is global — from European settlers conquering North America, Australia and parts of Africa to settler colonial expansion by Russia, Japan, Germany, China and others. We recognize that Zionism and its success in creating the Jewish State of Israel is an instance of settler colonialism in Palestine buoyed by long standing political, ideological and economic support by the USA. Zionism was rooted in 19th century European nationalisms and all significant strands of Zionism since the 1920s were predicated on Palestinian expulsion and Jewish supremacy. We recognize that Zionism is unique in that its project of settler colonialism is being perpetrated by many historical victims of settler colonialism, racism and genocide. This fact makes the crimes of Israel more tragic. We oppose settler colonialism in all its forms. Along with a lasting ceasefire in Palestine, we call for international law to be enforced, land rematriation and reparations to occur, and a lasting, equitable post-colonial peace settlement between Jews and non-Jews in historic Palestine. If you’d like to learn more, here are some resources for you to explore: For settler colonialism in global context, see Caroline Elkins and Susan Pederson’sSettler Colonialism in the Twentieth Century.It is fascinating to see how the two superpowers of the second half of the twentieth century (USA and Russian Empire conquered vast swathes of land in similar periods in the preceding centuries.

leoweekly_2023_81,"LEOhasn’t made an official endorsement in the race for Kentucky Governor, though it is safe to assume that Daniel Cameron is NOT our candidate.During the beginning and at the height of the pandemic, newly-elected Gov. Andy Beshear presented a calm and caring tone, acting with reserve and authority. Despite blowback and the rashness of the right, Beshear continued, and continues, to lead the state of Kentucky through the crisis and to greater stability.On the other hand, we have Daniel Cameron. His resume in public office could fit on a postage stamp. It’s that thin. Further, in crisis, particularly during his campaign, he’s made several errors that highlight his glaring inexperience. From how he handled the harassment issues in his staff to his claim that crime in Kentucky somehow was the fault of Beshear and not his own as the highest legal officer in the state as Attorney General. The crime rates that he claims are going up, reflect upon him and his lack of authority and leadership skills, and not that of Beshear.On those pieces of information alone, it is easy to see that the choice for Kentucky’s Governor should be the only clear (and unflappable adult in the room.There is nothing about current elections in the United States that happens without the taint of the prior “presidential” administration, with its leader now under 91 felony charges. This includes how that same person has dusted this political race with his bloviating negativity. The age of the raging man-children should be wildly disappointing and frightening for most Americans but here we are, with Cameron leading the pack of hurt man-babies having a circle jerk to the tune of Donald Trump’s voice.My guess, however, is that those, like the former White House orangutan, probably squeal at the thought that Cameron might behave like a good boy in the Governor’s mansion for their current White House campaign.Cameron has proven time and time again that integrity means nothing to him as he’s continuously sold himself, his community, and Kentucky off to the highest bidder to pad his meager record of experience and secure endorsements from the worst of his party.It’s inconceivable that any working family or any tax-paying Kentuckian would act in favor of Cameron and vote for him, especially on the endorsement of someone who misused and misreported funds to the tune of criminal charges.What we’d get with Cameron as governor would be unmitigated risk and pre-packaged and processed corruption.With Beshear, despite the silver spoon he came to public service with, we don’t get flash. We don’t get sassy language or the embarrassment of petty mudslinging. What we do get is calm, quiet leadership by a man who has built a life in Kentucky without giving away his ideals and dignity to the highest bidder.We get someone who has taken his roles in public service both as Attorney General, and Governor, very seriously and served this state to the best of his legal ability, and if we only look at his response to the pandemic, he deserves to serve another term as Governor that hopefully sees Kentucky move toward a newer and hopefully more modern future.So, if we are going to endorse anyone, we’re standing firmly with Andy.•*** ."

suffolknewsherald_2023_62,"Published 5:32 pm Tuesday, April 25, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardEditor’s note:State Del. Emily Brewer, in a telephone interview on Wednesday, April 26, said she supports an abortion ban exception to protect the life and health of a mother.Popular Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin gave terrific advice to the Republican faithful at a Richmond gathering last week, but it may have come a week too late for Emily Brewer and Hermie Sadler.“This is a big tent; let’s go fill it,” Youngkin implored at the annual Republican Advance, where GOP loyalists were fired up about their prospects this fall of flipping control of the state Senate and keeping their edge in the House of Delegates.Youngkin’s advice from personal experience: Toss out conventional wisdom that you win by firing up your base and go find new supporters.Eight days prior, the Republican tent instead got smaller in Senate District 17, where Brewer and Sadler are sprinting to the far right to win the GOP nomination. The two candidates, in proving their conservative bona fides at a Franklin forum, just might have cost the party a critical victory in the decidedly moderate 17th, which analysts say will be one of the handful of districts statewide that determine control of the Senate — and, in turn, Youngkin’s success in the final two years of his term.In the forum’s defining moments, Brewer and Sadler:The last one drew audible gasps even in a roomful of Republicans. For good reason. A Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies survey released in October found that 91% of Americans support abortion when the woman’s life is in danger and 86% support exceptions in the case of rape or incest. Even among Republicans, the PORES poll found 76% and 86% support exceptions for rape and incest and when the mother’s life is at risk, respectively.Likewise, red-flag laws are wildly popular. Some 73% of Virginians expressed support in a Christopher Newport University poll a few months before lawmakers enacted one in 2020.Youngkin himself showed Republican candidates how to win in “purple” places with his masterful upset of Terry McAuliffe in 2021: Dodge the Trump question, resist the red-meat topics adored by the base, and attract independents and moderate Democrats. Of note, Youngkin is the only Republican to win the new Senate District 17 in a statewide election going all the way back to 2016.It’s possible, of course, that both Brewer and Sadler simply spoke from the heart and are philosophically in the 10%-15% bracket on the far right of the electorate. There’s something to be said, even admired, in today’s poll-driven politics about staying true to your convictions.

leoweekly_2023_78,"This week — like last week and the week before that — some of the 2.394 renters in Louisville who have applied for emergency rental assistance will go to eviction court and get evicted after the city recently received $38 million of emergency rental assistance. More will be evicted without the opportunity to apply for rental assistance.If the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was correct and the long arc of the moral universe ultimately bends toward justice, that arc will have to do some extra bending to recover from what is currently happening to people who rent their homes in Louisville. While the Greenberg administration sits on $38 million of emergency rental assistance, renters sit in eviction court. Their worldly possessions will soon sit between a sidewalk and a street.How did we get here? Advocates and service providers aren’t sure because Mayor Craig Greenberg’s new administration has not provided any details about how they intend to prevent evictions with this emergency rental assistance or what they intend to do with this money.But, here’s what we think we know.On Dec. 22, Gov. Andy Beshear came to Louisville and announced that the state would be providing an additional $38 million in emergency rental assistance to Louisville. These funds are part of the $209 million Kentucky received from Treasury for emergency rental assistance in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA despite the fact that every elected official from Kentucky serving in Congress (except Rep. John Yarmuth opposed ARPA.At the time of the announcement,the Courier-Journal reportedthat, while “more details on how people can access this (emergency rental assistance will be released later”, then-Mayor Greg Fischer “indicated some of the incoming money will go toward that type of assistance for renters but more will be spent on creating additional affordable housing.”What proportion of the $38M will the city spend on desperately, immediately needed emergency rental assistance? Three-and-a-half weeks after the announcement (and after three-and-a-half weeks of orders of evictions from Jefferson District Court judges , we still do not know. Nor can people facing eviction in Louisville apply for emergency rental assistance.Meanwhile, the Kentucky Housing Corporation, the state agency that had been accepting and processing emergency rental assistance applications for Jefferson County, told renters in Louisville who had applied for emergency assistance that it would only process applications that were complete as of Dec. 22. To be “complete,” landlords must also either provide information or confirm they are not participating in the rental assistance program. In other words, 1 KHC stopped processing almost 2,400 applications for rental assistance and 2 directed those applicants to Louisville Metro for assistance while 3 Louisville Metro still has not started processing those applications or accepting new rental assistance applications despite having — depending on how you do the math — 2,400 or 38 million reasons to make emergency rental assistance available.Last Thursday, almost a dozen people who had applied for rental assistance got evicted. How many more of our neighbors who have done everything they can to get emergency rental assistance will Jefferson County District Court judges allow landlords to evict?What makes this entirely unacceptable and avoidable situation even more appalling is that Louisville Metro knows that it can (and must pay emergency rental assistance funds directly to renters even if landlords don’t participate in the program. Before Louisville depleted its own rental assistance funds and KHC took over servicing applications for assistance from Jefferson County, Metro employees administered a successful local program to distribute emergency rental assistance and prevent evictions. A November 2022 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, “Emergency Rental Assistance: A Blueprint for a Permanent Program,” lauded Louisville’s successful implementation of direct-to-renter payments and encouraged other jurisdictions to adopt it. The report said, “(Louisville’s program administrator noted that (Treasury not only encouraged direct-to-tenant assistance… but required it” and explained that “(t he Louisville ERA program expedited the processing of applications when tenants were to be paid directly” and — to further speed the delivery of desperately-needed funds to renters — city officials tracked which landlords had already declined to participate.It’s not that Louisville Metro doesn’t know how to provide money directly to renters to avoid evictions. It’s that, apparently, under Mayor Greenberg, we won’t.Instead of immediately processing the applications for rental assistance that KHC returned to the city, the city has disclaimed any responsibility for processing those applications. Instead of telling eviction court judges that the city was working to implement a new emergency rental assistance program with the newly-arrived $38 million and to please hold applicants’ eviction cases in abeyance to give the city time to process those applications, Metro officials represent to eviction court judges that those applications have been “withdrawn.” What? By whom?Regardless of what proportion of the $38 million in emergency rental assistance funds Louisville’s leaders ultimately decide to redirect to build affordable housing, no amount of affordable housing five to 10 years from now will unwind the daily devastation being done to families in Jefferson County’s eviction court.Does it even need to be said that preventing evictions is priority one if everyone in Louisville is to have safe, secure, affordable housing? Apparently, yes.Preventing evictions directly benefits our local economy, public health, and families’ financial stability and physical security. When people are able to remain in their homes, they have more money available for other necessities such as food and health-care expenses. Each eviction we prevent now provides stability that everyone — kid, parent, employee, elder, struggling person — deserves and needs to learn, grow, work, provide and care. Preventing evictions reduces strain on already stretched social services programs. In addition, preventing evictions helps protect our local landlords by reducing the financial burden of unpaid rent and associated costs.As we honor King’s life and legacy, I must say that — even if true — I find no comfort in the long arc of the moral universe bending toward justice. The people in Louisville whose lives and finances are upended by eviction, destroyed by poverty don’t have that kind of time. They need relief today.With federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, the new Greenberg administration can provide that relief and prevent thousands of evictions. That it hasn’t (won’t? is a deeply troubling start for Mayor Greenberg and his team.*** ."

Do you realize that for the first time in the state of Hawaii history, all four major county police departments — this being Hawaii, Honolulu, Maui and Kauai — has no current police chief with Hawaiian ancestry?I guess in this day and age, there are no more viable “local boy” (or girl police chief candidates that can effectively lead our island law enforcement agencies anymore. With all the crime rates and vacancies soaring in the respective police counties, maybe it’s time that we should go back to a local style type of police leadership that understands our local wants and needs.What do you think?Don’t get me wrong here. I’m not a racist, as my other half has blue eyes.Prentiss MorenoHiloThoughts on Smith caseCongratulations on the great work by the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney and the Hawaii Police Department’s Area I Criminal Investigations Section for working diligently to bring justice for Kaycee Smith and her family after 14 years.Successfully prosecuting violent crimes that occurred years ago is nothing new. Homicides are one the most challenging crimes any experienced investigator and seasoned prosecutor is tasked with.One of the most overlooked component of any violent crime that remains unsolved or unadjudicated are the survivors and families, who’ve suffered the initial loss and trauma at the time of the crime or may have also been a surviving victim. In any event, their suffering and anguish is prolonged while the case remains unsolved or unadjudicated, and oftentimes continues even after a conviction.Many violent crime investigations go and remain unsolved when the investigator has exhausted all viable leads that would lead toward resolution. These cases become even more challenging as time passes. Witnesses accounts change, they may pass away, or they may become uncooperative, and aged evidence or documents can be misplaced or destroyed.The term “cold case” was coined in the 1980s and was generally defined as a case goes “cold” when all investigative leads have been exhausted, with the case remaining unsolved for a period of three years.The public and the media continue to use the term “cold case,” as they see and hear this regularly on true crime stories amid their fascination with such cases.Law enforcement is slowly transitioning away from the term and have instead used “unsolved homicides” or “unsolved violent crimes” primarily in consideration of survivors and families. “Cold case” had a negative connotation for survivors, as it sometimes gives the impression that their case is now “shelved” or not being actively investigated.In light of staffing shortages, law enforcement agencies have committed personnel and forensic resources to revisiting their unsolved crimes.It is hoped it now gives the survivors some hope for resolution and justice.The Hawaii Police Department has recognized the absolute need to review and analyze many of the unsolved crimes by assigning one well-experienced detective to these cases. In addition, summaries of some of the unsolved crimes being investigated are posted on their website under the link to “Unsolved Homicides.”Mayor Mitch Roth likely misspoke when he refers to the Kaycee Smith case as “when this came in, it was a cold case.” He made similar references to the Peter “Peter Boy” Kema Jr. case when as the prosecutor, his office received the case after previous referrals. To his credit, the latter was finally adjudicated during his term as prosecutor.Two different and very complex cases, both with suspects identified early in the initial phases of the investigation. After years of perseverance, forensic examinations and follow up investigations, combined with excellent teams of prosecutors, both cases ended with successful resolutions.It’s hoped that the violent crime cases that include homicides and attempted homicide cases currently with the prosecutor can achieve the same successes.Keep up the incredible work!Greg EstebanPast president,International Homicide Investigators Association"
suffolknewsherald_2023_35,"Published 9:13 pm Monday, November 27, 2023ByStaff ReportsJeremiah 8:22 says: “Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is there no healing for the wound of my people?”In the work of ordained congregational ministry, I often find myself asking, “What is needed?” What do the people in my congregation need? The city of Suffolk? The children? Those living in poverty? Those being oppressed and excluded? God’s world?All sorts of answers can come to me through prayer, conversation, and research. People need to be uplifted, comforted, a meal, more books, better pay, relief, and traffic control. The earth needs cleaner air, water, and less debris. You get the picture.Just before beginning to write, I had the song “What the World Needs Now is Love,” from way back in 1965, pop into my mind. You know the song, “What the world needs now is love, sweet love. It’s the only thing there’s not enough of.” Written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach and a hit for Jackie DeShannon, it’s timeless.The song itself is timeless, and the message will always be true. Yet, I like to get specific sometimes. How does the world need love to be given or shown? Is it in the meal for the hungry, or a myriad of other ways, like those mentioned above? Yes, of course it is. There are specific things we can do to show love for others, especially strangers.Yet, I keep coming back to a theme that I see repeated in conversations I’ve had, studies I’ve read and events I’ve participated in. The world, and every part of it, needs healing. That includes you and me.This isn’t new. As scripture tells us, “There is nothing new under the sun.” Yet, it seems we are too unwilling to admit it or take part in the process. We have this false perception of independence and individualism that mostly leaves us alone, wishing deep down that we were a part of something. Because being a part of something, a community or cause, heals us in ways we didn’t know we needed to be. It gives us hope and connection. Whether it be the promise of working towards something better or the healing touch of holding another’s hand. We need that balm. As the traditional African-American spiritual song, ”There is a Balm in Gilead” tells us, “As there is a balm in Gilead, To make the wounded whole, There is a balm in Gilead, To heal the sin-sick soul, Sometimes I feel discouraged, And deep I feel the pain, In prayers the holy spirit, Revives my soul again.”Dear neighbors, I believe there is a resource near you that can provide healing in ways that no other thing can. It can give you the connections of community, friendships, food, music, meditation, quiet time, fun times, a common cause and Grace beyond any bounds. That resource is the local church.Yes, not all churches are healing. Not all Christians will welcome you. Yet, near you, there are those that will.Find them, and give yourself time together, as any prescription takes time to fully work.The world needs you and your healing heart.The Rev.

eugeneweekly_2023_29,"We ve got issues. The primary issue confronting the entire world at the moment is imperialism. Western imperialism is a danger to all life on this planet, especially as it risks global nuclear conflict, continues exacerbating the climate crisis and resuscitates fascism and militarism around the world. American hegemony reaches over continents, forcing a myriad of nations to succumb to Western economic pressures just to get IMF loans and more. Our military is deployed on every continent in the world, we have more than 800 military bases worldwide, the world’s largest navy with fleets in every ocean and a massive “intelligence” community that excels in cyber-warfare. We’re the closest we’ve ever been to achieving “full spectrum dominance” of land, sea, air, space and cyberspace. Besides the activities of the imperialists abroad, we can see clear as day the results of imperialism in our own communities. We see our fellow working people go broke, homeless, sick and starving while billionaires go to the bottom of the ocean, the edge of space and to private islands to flaunt their wealth and status. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. We see working class America struggling more and more to make ends meet, and watch as year after year the military budget is increased to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, as cities and counties approve increased police budgets and as Congress approves billions of dollars of military aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and more. We sat through a worldwide pandemic, declaring our bankruptcies and floundering to find jobs while corporations and the ruling class got bailed out with billions of dollars. We’ve watched as both parties constantly vote against the interests of the people, beat the drums of war, divide the working class with scapegoats and moral panics as well as work to repress dissenting voices. The distaste of the U.S. government, as well as most western governments and institutions, is palpable in every working-class person in America. Times like these have arisen in history multiple times, and in those moments, the most important task of the working class was anti-imperialist organizing. Great revolutions burst forth out of these periods, such as in Russia during WW I or Cuba and Vietnam during the Cold War. Anti-imperialist action brought the first world war to a close, brought independence to dozens of colonies around the world, ended our interventions in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, brought about nuclear treaties and, to some extent, brought about the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must protest the U.S./NATO role in the current conflict in Ukraine, and understand why Russia invaded Ukraine. We must stand with the anti-imperialist countries that are arising in a new multi-polar world such as Russia and China against Western imperialism, and reject the state department crafted narratives about these countries. We have to demand an end to NATO and imperialist institutions and doctrines. This is the most important task a human ever had, and we owe it to ourselves and our descendants to fight this fight. We need to organize demonstrations, direct action against local, state and federal governments, use local publications and media to denounce western imperialism, and build a popular front against Western imperialism and fascism. We must put differences aside and unite people from all backgrounds and demographics together for this struggle, as in the final analysis, we would all like to live and love and cherish our futures, and this will be impossible in a holocaust, whether it be fascist, nuclear or climate holocaust. We cannot let sectarianism and idealism get in our way. We need to organize disciplined, collective, centralized actions in coalition with as many organizations as possible, and build power against the empire and the system of imperialism. I’m calling all anti-imperialists in Oregon for this task, whether they be progressive, conservative, liberal, anarchist or apolitical. Let us unite and work to bring an end to imperialism so that we may finally see progress and avert the worst of the crises this world will face if imperialism is left uncontested. My email is Kamryn.Stringfield.z@gmail.com if anyone is interested in uniting for anti-imperialist action."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_133,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas. TCU s tuition is set to rise 7.9%. That’s an additional $4,500 year over year, for a grand total of $61,643. (Walter Arce/Dreamstime/TNS FORT WORTH, Texas — It’s the season for blow-out holiday sales. That thing you’ve been eyeing all year, the one that skyrocketing inflation made just a little too pricey to justify, is probably now a steal.If only that were the case about college tuition. Instead, that just continues to rise. And Fort Worth’s own Texas Christian University seems to be leading the pack.As multiple news sites, including the Star-Telegram have recently noted, during the next academic year, TCU’s tuition is set to rise a whooping 7.9%. That’s an additional $4,500 year over year, for a grand total of $61,643 — an increase that means the cost of attending TCU now tops that of Harvard, America’s oldest and most prestigious university.Harvard costs only a measly $56,249 in comparison. After the $50k mark, what’s a couple thousand more, really?Mind you, that’s just tuition; it doesn’t include food, housing, books or the countless other fees and expenses (which TCU estimates will cost another $20k that accrue during college.Don’t even get me started on graduate school.Perhaps more startling than the price tag itself is the rapid rate at which tuition has grown.In the past 12 years, the cost of full-time TCU tuition has almost doubled.Wages, of course, have not. Although, everything else in life has become more expensive.But college tuition costs have far outpaced even inflation, making a private college experience like the one TCU seeks to provide completely out of the question for a growing number of families.To be fair, TCU doesn’t stand-out as a particular offender when it comes to college tuition mania.The cost of attending a private university has soared exponentially over the last decade, currently averaging at$38,800 annually, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.While private universities like to point to their generous financial assistance and scholarships, many middle class families earn enough to make them ineligible for significant aid but not enough to pay a financially paralyzing bill each semester.And so students take on debt (in Texas, the average upon graduation is over $32,000 which cripples young people, delays the start of families, and serves only to inflate college costs even further.According to one recent report, there are now three times as many administrators— many making six-figure salaries — and other professionals as there are faculty at the leading schools in the country.That’s astonishing. It’s also a bit infuriating, isn’t it?Universities populate task forces and committees and build entire departments around diversity and inclusion. The ultimate result, however, is that bloated administrative budgets make the cost of private college so onerous as to be exclusive to an increasingly small group of students.All of this should cause us to wonder if the suffocating cost of a private education is really worth it?Most Americans don’t seem to think so.A Gallup poll released last summer found only a paltry 36% of Americans have confidence in higher education. That number has been waning for years, but Gallup noted the sharp decline in its latest reading.The poll didn’t speculate or pursue reasons for the decline, but I will: Cost and value are certainly part of the equation.Then consider the low-cost of community colleges and trade schools — often less than $5,000 a year — and the comparable return on investment.Think about how difficult and expensive it is to find a good and reliable tradesman these days and how quickly a student can start working after only a two-year program, sometimes even during their course of study with an apprenticeship program.Private college will always be part of the plan for some students; it will increasingly be out of reach for others.But the ever-rising cost of tuition should force us to consider its long-term value.We need to start demanding a reduction in bloat and an increase in efficiency at elite schools, or begin encouraging more young people to seek alternative paths to professional success."
suffolknewsherald_2023_222,"Published 5:26 pm Tuesday, August 15, 2023ByJen Jaqua1980 began with news of Middle East unrest. In January, stories from the front pages read, “Afghan leader warns he’ll seek more Soviet assistance,” “Soviet soldiers battled Afghan opposition forces 60 miles from the Pakistani border” and “Soviets have secured the Afghan capital of Kabul and have moved out to secure the central Asian country’s only major road network.” The reports also said the Soviet troops mortared and bombed major telegraphic switchboards and government telecommunications installations, cutting off most communications within Afghanistan.Even Pope John Paul II ushered in the new decade by warning that a nuclear war in which 200 of the world’s 50,000 atom bombs were dropped could destroy all the major cities of the world and kill up to 200 million people.The unrest raised concerns about oil prices. “Iranian Oil Minister Ali Akbar Moinfar warned Western Europe and Japan today that any country joining the United States in imposing economic sanctions against Iran ‘will be deprived of oil.’”In February, it was announced that the United States would boycott the Moscow Summer Olympics because the Soviet Union had ignored the deadline to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. “President Carter told the United States Olympic Committee over the weekend that American athletes should not participate in the Moscow Olympics and the committee has said it would abide by the president’s decision,” White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler said. Sixty-five countries joined the boycott of the Olympics.Early in 1980, improvements to the Main Street bridge over the Nansemond River got an open door with the approval of the U.S. House of Representatives water resources bill. Included in the bill was legislation by Congressman Robert Daniel which de-authorized the river near Main Street for use as a navigable channel. If approved by the Senate and the president, the legislation would open the way for the construction of an ordinary fixed-span bridge.At the end of February and beginning of March, Suffolk was buried in snow.“The cost of living had continued to skyrocket. Gas was $1.20 a gallon. And it snowed a total of 43 inches within two months in the southern city of Suffolk. This was the ‘Winter of 1980.’ But when Suffolkians look back 20, 30 or even 40 years from now, recalling the infamous winter of ’8O, perhaps they will remember something else besides the rising inflation level or the price of gasoline. The 1980 blizzard may be remembered for how well the people of Suffolk reacted in a crisis situation and how a general good feeling of helping out our fellow man prevailed throughout the town. The weekend blizzard dropped 16 inches on Suffolk, coming close to breaking the ‘snowstorm of the century’ record of 17 inches on February 6. But in this most recent storm, gusts of wind piled up four- and five-foot high drifts, especially in the more rural areas where wind had an open sweep across fields. Many people were stranded in their homes Sunday and Monday. And the snow didn’t bother to discriminate. Even the people who run the city were unable to reach their offices Monday. Obici Memorial Hospital was having trouble transporting personnel to and from the hospital. They issued a call for volunteer drivers with four-wheel vehicles through radio and television. More than a dozen persons responded and began making runs taking exhausted personnel home through to the early morning hours Monday. Suffolk police reported about 15 volunteer drivers came to the rescue with their four-wheel drives, helping police reach impassable areas of the city.”To contrast heavy snow on the East Coast, on May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens blasted 1,300 feet of its top off in violent eruptions that sent hot mud, ash and gasses raging down its slopes. Nine fatalities were confirmed from the volcanic fury, and officials said that at least 21 others were missing. Heavy ash boiled out of the mountain, blotting out the sky and leaving gritty, slippery deposits on roads as far east as Montana and Wyoming, 500 miles away. National Weather Service officials said because the finer particles of ash had been blown into the stratosphere by upper-level winds, the dust could circle the globe for up to two years, possibly having an effect on worldwide weather patterns.First snow, then a volcano — if that didn’t make enough headlines, by the end of summer the area was facing severe drought conditions. In September, water rationing was being considered. “Portsmouth Water Co. customers may eventually find their bills multiplied by as much as 22 if they go beyond rationing quotas. Such quotas are not yet in effect. However, Portsmouth officials were reportedly considering them as late as yesterday, as they watched reservoir levels drop an average of one-half a percent a day under current drought conditions. ‘If the reservoirs get to 50%, we will have to take a hard look at rationing,’ Portsmouth utility director John A. Howell said. Under a rationing plan, if one is implemented, customers would be told to reduce consumption by a set figure. If the figure was 25%, any water used beyond 75% of last year’s consumption would come at a higher price. Customers now pay about 45 cents for each 100 cubic feet of water. If they went beyond a rationing limit, the price would shoot up to $10 for the excess water used. If Portsmouth does go to a rationing plan, that would be the third major move it has made to counter this year’s drought. It began by asking for citizens voluntarily to cut back, then, on Sept. 8, initiated mandatory restrictions. Under the most recent phase, users were prohibited from watering lawns, washing cars, buildings or sidewalks, filling swimming pools or running ornamental fountains.”On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2023_58,"Editor s Note: On Wednesday, March 29, Kentucky Republican lawmakers passed SB150, overriding Governor Andy Beshear s veto. Since I wrote this piece before its passage, I think it is more integral that we rally to care and protect those who are affected. Since this primarily affects young people, I think it is time to set up independent opportunities for appropriate sexual health education and to share and promote resources likeLouisville Youth GroupandFairness Campaignwho can assist with connecting these young people to safe spaces, actions, and care. As well, in light of these developments, if you know of anyone who needs mental health services or is contemplating suicide, or if you are in need of help, please call 988 or reach out toLouisville Metro Suicide Preventionor text LOU to 741741.Thisis seemingly random, but it occurred to me while driving this morning that I have spent a lifetime telling my LGBTQ friends and straight friends, “I don’t care who you love.” I realized today that, really, that is a complete lie. I absolutely DO care who they love. I care who everyone loves. It matters.In the current political turmoil where members of so many communities are coming under attack from right-wing politicians with little knowledge and too much power, it does matter that we care more about who our friends in these communities love.Now, pay very close attention. Why it matters is simple. I care about who my friends love because it is my ultimate wish for them to feel safe, protected, and happy. If for any reason that isn’t happening, I am enraged and ready to defend them without reserve. This includes friends who say they still care about people who are actively harming them, be they parents, friends, or lovers.I think what led me to this, today, on a drive to the office for press day, was something else very simple. I am disheartened by the lack of care, but more so by the lack of action (at times to fight these headwinds of hatred coming from the right.I truly believe that the number of people who are actively hateful is small, but they are loud, and I just want to hear the volume go up in defense of those who are being persecuted by the recent slate of legislation across the country.From Florida’s rejection of an AP African American studies course earlier this year to Kentucky’s attacks on drag performances and transgender youth, I know that those of us who care are making noise, but we are up against a right-wing machine that has prided itself on being the bigger noisemaker over the last 30 years. They have proven to be inhospitable at best, while begging the other side to remain civil, and to our detriment, we have, but because I care that my friends are alive to love and be loved, I just don’t know how much longer civility can reign.I am not an advocate of violence, but I think the relentless compromise that Republicans demand but never offer needs to be completely off the table going forward. I’m saying that Democrats, independents, and any others who are in complete opposition to these policies and actions taken by the Republican party need to wash their hands of the need to paint with broad strokes like “I don’t care who you love.”We need to actively care and to actively give a shit, just as we actively fight these policies, because the weeds are where the Republicans have dragged us, and we can scrap in the dust just like they can.At no point should any of these lawmakers who sign onto these bills feel that their platform is safe. Their offices shouldn’t be safe; we should always challenge them. Their businesses shouldn’t be safe; we should check when, where, and how we accidentally or forthrightly patronize their businesses and services. For instance, Lindsey Tichenor, who is attached to several anti-LGBTQ bills in Kentucky like SB 150, is a realtor for Covenant Realty, so why should she feel her business is off-limits from people who know of her harmful actions in the state legislature?My premise is plain. The reason why I needed to come clean about caring about who my friends love. It’s this: physical safety should be protected in America, but your ability to be a horrible human is absolutely not. There are so many ways to shut down Republicans’ ability to be nightmares. We just need to dig them up and actively use them to shut down their desire, need, or ability to create and pass legislation that harms and puts others real physical safety at risk.•Fairness Campaign Statement on Veto Override of SB150While we lost the battle in the legislature, our defeat is temporary. We will not lose in court. And we are winning in so many other ways. Thousands of Kentucky kids came to the Capitol today to make their voices heard against the worst anti-trans bill in the nation. They are our hope for a Kentucky future that is more fair, more just, and more beautifully diverse and accepting than ever before.I applaud the brave protesters who stood their ground in the Kentucky House gallery today before being removed by Kentucky State Troopers. Their chants and pain were heard by all in the chamber and were a necessary show of the grief and harm Senate Bill 150 will cause. Transgender children and their families in Kentucky are scared, rightfully so. We will do all we can to ensure they can continue to access the life-saving medical care they deserve.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_144,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The politically inspired impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden has failed to produce any convincing evidence that Biden has committed the “high crimes and misdemeanors” required by the U.S. Constitution for the conviction and removal of a chief executive. So naturally Speaker Mike Johnson is proposing a floor vote, likely next week, to authorize the inquiry as a “necessary step.”Johnson attempted to justify a vote by the full House — which should have been taken months ago as a procedural matter — as a response to supposed White House stonewalling. But it’s hard not to see it as the latest attempt by the House Republicans leadership to placate the far-right cohort of their conference and Trump cultists in the party at large.Deposed Speaker Kevin McCarthy launched the Biden impeachment inquiry in September without securing a floor vote, thus avoiding a scenario in which saner members of his fragile majority — including Republicans elected in districts where Biden is popular — might rebel. Those same Republicans should join Democrats in denying legitimacy to this impeachment circus by voting no.Despite questions about the business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and aspersions cast on what Republicans call “the Biden crime family,” no proof has been offered that President Joe Biden benefited from his son’s business dealings or shaped U.S. policy because of them.Testimony by Devon Archer, a former Hunter Biden associate, spectacularly failed to substantiate allegations that President Biden had any significant involvement in his son’s business affairs. Republicans also seem to be trying to breathe new life into a claim, debunked long ago, that as vice president Biden pushed for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, because Shokin was investigating Burisma, a company on whose board Hunter Biden served. In fact, the Obama administration’s campaign against Shokin was part of a multinational effort to press Ukraine to deal with corruption.Finally, on Monday the House Oversight Committee announced portentously that Hunter Biden’s business entity, Owasco PC, which had received payments from foreign companies, had made monthly payments to Joe Biden. Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said the payments “are now part of a pattern revealing Joe Biden knew about, participated in and benefited from his family’s influence peddling schemes.”But the Washington Post reported that the payments — made in 2018, when Joe Biden was a private citizen — were reimbursements for a truck Biden helped his financially strapped son to purchase.The details of the overblown allegations against the president are almost beside the point, which is that the faltering impeachment inquiry is best viewed as an exercise in toadying to former President Trump, who has accused Biden of being “the most corrupt president we’ve ever had.” House Republicans faced with a vote on legitimizing this fishing expedition should ask themselves if it’s their interests to climb aboard this particular carriage in the Trump train.—Los Angeles Times/TNSNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
suffolknewsherald_2023_193,"Published 3:30 pm Friday, September 15, 2023ByStaff ReportsThe U.S. has grown closer to Europe, potentially risking its downfall. While we separated from Europe in 1776 for liberty, European influence has returned through entities like the United Nations, World Economic Forum, and the Council on Foreign Relations. According to Harvard Scholar Dr. Carrol Quigley in his timely book, “The Anglo American Establishment,” the CFR, established by the British Empire’s Cecil Rhodes, wields significant power, placing representatives in executive branches and departments since WWII and has heavily influenced America’s foreign policy.This trend persisted across modern presidencies, undermining true American leadership. According to Dr. Quigley, European and American industrialists orchestrated the United Nations, aligning with colonialism, and from my analysis, this is harming America’s reputation. Foreign policy entanglements divert attention from domestic issues like immigration and economic decline. This diversion weakens the efficacy of the government to address the class disparities because the lobbyists have their ears. According to research put out by American businessman Patrick Bet David on the Joe Rogan Podcast, he stated that the economy is being bought up by a few corporations: BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard. He believes they are consolidating all the power into a few hands.In conclusion, America is dealing with a deep seated European umbrella influence in Washington, that is withholding American statesmanship from reigning true. On the other hand, America’s economy operates under crony capitalism and caters to a rich class that lives outside of the norms of the eroding middle class and poor class, ultimately widening the gap between the rich and the poor.Drew Varner, a resident of Suffolk, is a researcher and writer.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

This is the single largest investment in water that the federal government has ever made, but it is simply not enough.Only a small fraction of this money will be available for Virginia’s clean water needs.In a recent estimate, $146 billion per year is needed in the United States for the next 20 years. The water sector was the second highest among the six sectors compared, with transportation ranking the highest.Some of the biggest challenges facing our water systems are aging infrastructure and increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. Unfortunately, federal funding for water infrastructure has not kept pace with the growing need. Many of our nation’s water and sewer systems were built decades ago and are in dire need of upgrades and repairs.According to the American Society of Civil Engineers Infrastructure Report Card, Virginia’s drinking water infrastructure received a grade of C+ while wastewater infrastructure earned a D+. With PFAS regulations looming and Chesapeake Bay restoration ongoing, the federal government must prioritize funding for these critical projects to protect public health, support economic growth and preserve our environment.Failure to do so not only puts our communities at risk, but also undermines our nation’s ability to compete and thrive in a global economy. Greater federal investment in America’s infrastructure has a direct positive impact on American households’ ability to access affordable water – especially the most vulnerable low-income households.Jay BernasSuffolkCorbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

For me, I’m incredibly grateful to be part of Hawaii Island, and our East Hawaii community that helps guide the mission of Child &Family Service. Everyday our dedicated staff, alongside other community partners in East Hawaii, bring hope and healing to those grappling with some of the most difficult life challenges.It’s encouraging to reflect on those we serve, who, in their vulnerability and courage, trust our team members to help navigate their journey. Each participant shows our Hawaii Island community their strength, teaching us all invaluable lessons about life, problem-solving and the enduring power of the human spirit.Despite the challenges many of our program participants have endured, it’s inspiring to see how our staff each day are building strong relationships within our community. East Hawaii is more than a location. It’s our home. We are so grateful for this community, our trusted care partners in East Hawaii and the CFS ‘ohana for creating a culture where hope and healing flourish.These positive feelings help us as we work with other community-based organizations to combat issues facing East Hawaii. Recently, we’ve seen the increased need for domestic violence services on Hawaii Island, highlighting the vital role of community-based organizations like ours.In 2021, the CFS domestic violence programs served 976 families. That number skyrocketed to 1,606 in FY 2023 — a stark 60% increase.Although we are seeing a rise in domestic violence, we also witness the healing for these families each day. With the holistic approach to work hand-in-hand with other local nonprofits, we serve the entire family. This community partnership model has proven most effective in ending the cycle of violence and fostering recovery for East Hawaii families.From safety services to advocacy, education, support groups and counseling, together we strive to provide a full spectrum of care. We have learned that it takes a village to revitalize families, to help them break their traumas of domestic violence and rebuild.At CFS, we recognize that this team approach provides a powerful safety net for East Hawaii families, with both the CFS staff members alongside the community care partners together working to create positive change. The key to bringing upon a brighter future for families is first and foremost prioritizing the health and well-being of our team. It is vital that staff also feel cared for. This allows them to fully promote a healthy life and new beginning for domestic violence survivors.“I am grateful for the people I work with. We are such a tight knit team, I am grateful for the ways we support and care for each other,” said Leimana Koehler, of the CFS East Hawaii Domestic Violence Advocacy program.All of us at CFS want to express our deepest gratitude for the families we serve who trust us with their journey, and our supporters.We also are thankful for our incredibly important community partners in East Hawaii — your perseverance and dedication to creating a healthy path for generations to come is inspiring.Christine Fliniau (Terry is director of East Hawaii Island Programs at Child &Family Service."

leoweekly_2023_7,"It’sour last issue of September, and we are celebrating theater. Louisville has a long and storied theater history over all the generations of our city, which was founded in 1776. Good luck counting all the currently running theater groups, because just as you think you’ve got an accurate count, one might close and three more will rise to take its place. We’re a town that loves a bit of drama and lots of razzle-dazzle.When sitting to write this week’s editor’s note, the only thing on my mind was, “Ouch, my tooth hurts,” and I started quoting Hamlet as I mused over whether I could transcend this pain while maintaining my sanity. As Shakespeare wrote it:To be, or not to be, that is the question:Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,Or to take arms against a sea of troublesAnd by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,No more; and by a sleep to say we endThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocksThat flesh is heir to: ‘tis a consummationDevoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep;To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub:The shock of surprise dental work and a shockingly painful recovery just before my first real vacation in years is disappointing, but there’s always something in the quest to be human and to live a good human life. Even in pain, I am grateful for the ability to use drama to my advantage as I whine, moan, and groan around the house, terrifying my child that I might actually keel over from a toothache at any moment.It is the drama that illuminates our condition as creatures here on earth.Hamlet certainly was pondering bigger questions than a tooth. Still, a toothache is definitely one of the “natural shocks that flesh is heir to,” and so it fits that pain puts us in touch with one of the most famous monologues in history, and adds a bit of comedy to my writing this note that’s really about nothing specific this week.I guess my tooth drama could be as gripping as any drama about the human condition. In Eugene O’Neill’s play “Beyond the Horizon,” the sons of James Mayo, Robert and Andrew, have a tiff about Robert’s body and health when Andrew comments that Robert’s upcoming trip will do his body some good.“All of you seem to keep harping on my health. You were so used to seeing me lying around the house in the old days that you never will get over the notion that I’m a chronic invalid, and have to be looked after like a baby all the time, or wheeled ‘round in a chair like Mrs. Atkins. You don’t realize how I’ve bucked up in the past few years. Why, I bet right now I’m just as healthy as you are—I mean just as sound in wind and limb; and if I was staying on at the farm, I’d prove it to you. You’re suffering from a fixed idea about my delicateness—and so are Pa and Ma. Every time I’ve offered to help, Pa has stared at me as if he thought I was contemplating suicide,”Robert says in agitation to Andrew, who responds hilariously.“Nobody claimed the undertaker was taking your measurements. All I was saying was the sea trip would be bound to do anybody good.”Being human is a sensitive thing, and while we might moan and groan about how we’re feeling, the truth is, we’re all suffering in some way and perhaps triumphing in others and our desires such as a big trip are life-giving… like medicine. Robert needs this trip. Me too, Robert, but Andrew’s response to him gets a laugh from me anytime. We’re often caught up in our own heads and unable to see what someone might be really trying to say to us.When Arlie, a protagonist from Marsha Norman’s Louisville-set “Getting Out,” is serving time in a maximum security cell, she’s certainly having a time… something different than a toothache, but she’s aching for sure. She’s talking to one of the guards:“No, I don’t have to shut up, neither. You already got me in seg-re-ga-tion, what else you gonna do? I got all day to sleep, while everybody else is out bustin ass in the laundry. laughs Hey! I know…you ain’t gotta go do no dorm count, I’ll just tell you and you just sit. Huh? You preciate that? Ease them corns you been moanin about……Yeah …OK. Write this down. pride mixed with alternating contempt and amusement Startin down by the john on the backside, we got Mary Alice. Sleeps with her pillow stuffed in her mouth. Says her mom says it’d keep her from grindin her teeth or somethin. She be suckin that pillow like she gettin paid for it. laughs Next, it’s Betty the Frog. Got her legs all opened up like some fuckin…… Makes croaking noises Then it’s Doris eatin pork rinds. Thinks somebody gonna grab em out of her mouth if she eats em during the day. Doris ain’t dumb. She fat, but she ain’t dumb. Hey! You notice how many girls is fat here? Then it be Rhoda, snorin, Marvene, wheezin and Suzanne, coughin,”she says.Arlie’s got a few axes to grind about the humans around her. I’m sure my whiny tooth-aching would send her over the edge, but everyone around her in prison is going through something as well, and that’s just life, folks. We might learn a lot about it on the stage, but the truth is, theater just helps us have a little more compassion for the fact that we’re all toothaching, suffering, celebrating, whining, growing up, dying, etc. I’m hoping that you take a moment to tap into that compassion, because it feels so often like we’ve forgotten how to understand each other and to know that we’re all having a “toothache” of some sort.Anyway,hope you get to a theater near you, really soon! I’ll see you again in the October 25 issue.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_68,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°There are many ways to deny demagogic, anti-democratic Donald John Trump a second presidential term, which is an American imperative. When Trump was running for a first term in 2016, this newspaper ran the longest editorial in its history urging his defeat. When he was running for reelection in 2020, we outlined 99 reasons he had to be beaten. Fortunately, that time he was, and soundly so.Trump should’ve been convicted in his second impeachment trial in 2021. If he had been, the Senate could have disqualified him from serving as president again. He wasn’t.Trump quite possibly will be convicted of charges brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith that he conspired to defraud the United States and to disrupt official proceedings — the peaceful transfer of power — on Jan. 6. If he is found guilty, his dreams of a second term will almost surely vanish. But that hasn’t happened yet.Is there another way? Tempted though we are to say yes, we cannot. Colorado’s Supreme Court has removed Trump from that state’s ballot, citing Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to deem him ineligible for having participated in an insurrection against the nation.That language states: “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.”Trump unquestionably spread lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him. He undoubtedly riled up the crowd on Jan. 6, then sat back while they defiled the Capitol. But it is yet to be determined if he “engaged in insurrection or rebellion.” Conviction on the charges Smith has brought in federal court would be close to formal legal confirmation of that claim, but that may or may not come to pass — and even that is an inexact fit.There are other looming questions: Does that provision of the 14th Amendment even apply to presidents? Some scholars say no. Is it legitimate to apply language crafted in the wake of the Civil War, intended to apply to Confederate traitors, to a modern-day sore loser who never took up arms but wanted to rile up his aggrieved supporters?Such a consequential interpretation of the nation’s highest legal document shouldn’t happen state by state. It should be made by the U.S. Supreme Court. If a majority of that conservative-leaning bench deems Trump disqualified, we’ll take it. If not, Democrats or someone else will have to defeat him at the ballot box — or his criminal conviction will effectively remove him from contention.Trump must not be president again. In a second term he would persecute his political enemies, divide the nation along demographic lines, abandon America’s allies and make a wreck of our economy. But chances are, he’ll have to be defeated at the ballot box — not by having higher powers remove him from ballots.— New York Daily News"
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_87,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°A lot of folks have deeply held opinions about Gen Z. Some say they lack initiative — how else could they spend that much time on TikTok? Some question their maturity — it’s not possible to be independent while still being on your parents’ phone plan, right? A lot like judges at the Westminster Dog Show, these folks tend to look for flaws rather than opportunities to tap into potential.I’m about two months in as an assistant professor at the Crump College of Law at St. Thomas University, and in the short time I’ve spent with students in my Civil Procedure class, it has become clear that Gen Z — like every generation before it — defies generalizations and stereotypes.Leaders for life. That’s the mission at STU — a small Catholic school in Miami Gardens, Florida. The students who come here do so because they know that the scale, scope, and significance of contemporary social ills mean that no one can sit on the sidelines. That’s why STU students are proactively seeking the skills that will allow them to contribute to problem solving today and for decades to come.Of course, I can’t speak to the habits and motivations of every student, but I can share a few short stories that contest the conception of Gen Z as a bunch of wannabe social media influencers.At 9 a.m. on the first day I held office hours, two students were outside my door. We’d only covered the syllabus and the timeline of litigation at that point, so I had no clue what they planned to discuss. Both quickly filled in the blanks for me — they were building a relationship and demonstrating their commitment to making the most of every educational resource at their disposal.On the second day of class, I looked at the clock — class didn’t start for another five minutes but nearly every student was in their seat, at attention, waiting to learn the skills they plan to use to lead for life.At the end of the third class, a line of ten students formed to ask follow-up questions. These weren’t simple “yes or no” inquiries indicative of a student napping rather than note taking — they were thoughtful comments that showed a strong desire to not only understand the material but master it.You’re thinking … so what? That happened when I went to school, too.That’s exactly the point. There’s no Sorting Hat placing us in the “right” generation; demographers draw lines in the chronological sand and hope for the best. Every generation has members who struggle, who languish, and who “partake” more than they participate. Focusing on those few distracts us — members of older generations — from the more important task: providing younger individuals with “future proof” skills and inspiring them to tackle challenges rather than cower before them.Gen Z and every generation that follows will face more perils that require worldwide coordination, collaboration, and communication than any prior generation. Take AI, for example — it presents the perfect storm of risks. Absent the sort of problem solving I mentioned, AI may undermine governments, cause widespread skill atrophy, and unleash a kind of war that not even Hollywood can imagine. Climate change, pandemics, and income inequality carry similar risk profiles.If you find even one of those risks compelling, then you have a motive for investing in Gen Z rather than interrogating their social media habits and their love of vintage shirts and baggy clothes.You may have already known all this about many members of Gen Z — that young person down the street perhaps … the one with a drive to learn, a desire to make an impact, and devotion to readying for society in advance of the dire threats looming on the horizon. Let’s talk more about that person and the many members of Gen Z just like them. There’s not much value in tearing down the generation we need to build up institutions that crumbled on our watch.Emmress Ann Harpole, 75, of Hilo died July 29 at home.

suffolknewsherald_2023_15,"Published 5:47 pm Friday, June 23, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardSome news from far western Virginia caught our eye, reminding us of a challenge we issued in this space a few months back.TheBristol Herald-Courier reportsthat elected boards in five localities — the counties of Lee, Scott, Wise and Dickenson, plus Norton City Council — passed resolutions of support for efforts to attract data centers to the region.Western Tidewater, with Suffolk leading the charge, should make a similar push as an economic development and land-use alternative to warehouses and solar farms, which are proliferating.Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced in January that Amazon Web Services would invest $35 billion to build multiple data centers in Virginia by 2040. Northern Virginia, which has been a hotbed for data center construction, apparently has more of them than it wants, so other regions of the state stand to capitalize on the opportunity.Aside from the economic impact of new jobs and much-needed tax revenue for local governments, landing one of the Amazon facilities would demonstrate to citizens of Western Tidewater that elected and appointed leadership has a vision beyond warehouses, which bring some tax revenue but relatively few jobs — and create major highway congestion as 18-wheelers roll in and out.Data centers, the Herald-Courier notes, serve as critical infrastructure for the storage, processing and distribution of vast amounts of information.To be clear, data centers alone aren’t the answer economically for our region. Like warehouses, they don’t employ huge numbers of people and they aren’t the most pleasant structures aesthetically. But, other than the electrical grid, they are light burdens on infrastructure, especially roads.Youngkin said in January that “numerous localities” in the commonwealth are under consideration by Amazon, which will create a combined 1,000 new jobs.Communities under consideration “offer robust utility infrastructure, lower costs, great livability and highly educated workforces and will benefit from the associated economic development and increased tax base, assisting the schools and providing services to the community,” he said.Southwest Virginia, in the localities’ resolution, touts its competitive workforce, robust infrastructure and a favorable business climate that make it an ideal location for data centers seeking to expand or establish operations.Suffolk and Western Tidewater can make a similarly persuasive case.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_214,"Published 5:51 pm Friday, August 25, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldDemocrats and Republicans in a divided Richmond say they’ve finally negotiated a compromise on a state budget flush with billions in unexpected revenue.The state’s general ledger account balance has ballooned to $29 billion, more than triple what it was four years ago. State law permits cash reserves of an amount equivalent to 15% of the general fund, and the state is on track to be at 18% by next summer.Republicans wanted to use the surplus for tax cuts, while Democrats wanted more money for public education. The compromise, announced Friday after months of on-again, off-again negotiations, appears to be a mix of the two. Taxpayers will get small one-time rebates and a higher standard deduction, while schools will get some extra funding.If you have a strong feeling about one priority or the other, be sure to vote in this fall’s General Assembly elections, which will determine control of the House and Senate. Currently, Democrats have a narrow majority in the Senate, while Republicans have a similarly narrow edge in the House of Delegates.If the GOP holds the House in November and flips the Senate, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin will have no trouble passing deeper, more permanent tax relief. If Democrats win one or both legislative chambers, expect budget negotiations in 2024 that will be every bit as tense as those just completed.In that event, perhaps both parties could compromise by sending more money to local governments, which aren’t rolling in the dough like state government.We’ve always believed the best government is the government closest to the people – town and city councils and boards of supervisors. At the very least there’s more accountability at the local level, where elected officials have a more direct relationship with taxpayers and where there are fewer bureaucrats to waste or mismanage the tax dollars collected.Local governing boards best understand the needs of the citizens they serve. Their primary method of taxation – real and personal property taxes – can be the most painful for citizens, especially during inflationary times like those in recent years.More state funding could take some pressure off property tax rates and help local governments fund essential services and capital projects. Schools could also benefit from the money, but with some accountability since the additional state money would flow through city councils and boards of supervisors, which appropriate school funding.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2023_19,"I always find myself in some kind of void at the end of summer. This odd funk changes in veracity from time to time, but this one is huge for me. My son, we’ll call him V, is stepping into his full awareness of self.V is halfway to thirteen and the changes in him have been amazing to witness. It seems he just woke up one morning and was a different person. I remember the moment vividly as he slept in one day and came into the living room looking like a praying mantis. His gangly body grew faster than his brain and it reeked of awkwardness.“‘Sup?,” is the greeting I hear as he fumbles towards the chair and slumps down, legs wide open. I do not recognize this person as he stares me directly in the eye.I could see a glimpse of my toddler but it was faint and fleeting. He spoke of his plans for the day in a tone that expressed a full adolescent boredom. He’d stayed up late sharing music with a few online friends. They have formed some type of band and he wanted to share some music they share with one another.I listen with interest as he shows off his creation proudly. The music is instrumental and electronic with altered sounds that they manipulate. He is hooked and passionate about something. As his mother, it is beautiful to witness.Vhas been a challenge to raise with diagnoses that have worried me. My mother, his “Nan,” has declared that he is the strangest child she has ever dealt with and the most independent.Vhas lived on the outside of groups from the very beginning, preferring to be alone in his mind instead. He would gravitate to other kids with no fear and no filter but would always end up playing alone. The energy and dynamics that come with groups of kids could overwhelm him and he would retreat into himself time and again.He would complete tasks but with no consideration for the directions or requests of an early evaluation. This got him in Pre-K at three years old. He went to school with no fear and couldn’t wait to ride the bus. The social worker in me tried not to analyze but it was evident that my very bright son didn’t learn the same way as other kids.Soon he developed obsessions with machinery, ships and trains. He offered little interest in anything else and preferred books on the Titanic or trains instead of stories. By the time he was six, the obsession with tornado sirens began. He studied every style and found the Federal Signal Thunderbolt 1000T to be his favorite.We put him in baseball, soccer and basketball to push his ability to focus with stimulation all around him to see if we could help him to adapt, to no avail. He got overstimulated at his first open house and screamed so loud in the full cafeteria that he quieted the room.He had the same reaction to certain types of fire alarms in public. I remember having to run him into the bathroom at the state fair with my jacket over his head so he could relieve himself with some calm. I ran into an old friend as we exited the stall and wanted to say, “hello,” but had to run past her and request she meet us outside so I could speak and explain the situation.The IEPs started and deeper evaluations followed quickly. I avoided pharmaceuticals as long as I could but the pressure was on to help my son find a way to learn. V was aware that he was different from other kids as he attempted to connect. There were moments of reciprocation, but some kids found his obsession with trains and tornado sirens boring and his jokes obnoxious.The screaming fits subsided but his inability to handle external energies and stimulation would build and find release in saying things that disturbed his classrooms as it brought the silence he required when overwhelmed. He would offer to throw himself out of windows or prepare to be put up for adoption should he disappoint a teacher or his parents.School has been a struggle every year with calls home concerned about his sporadic outbursts.I grabbed every resource I could from our community to get him through elementary school and into his first year at middle school.Vis starting seventh grade with a different attitude. He has found connections via the internet and peers at school that speak his musical language and he has a confidence that looks good on him. I’m watching him engage with his tribe and I feel an odd mixture of happiness, exhaustion, and relief as it has been a long time coming. We had such a fun and peaceful summer, I don’t want it to end.I can feel my anxiety rising as he crosses into puberty and self-direction in an environment where he has yet to thrive. I have no idea how the year will go and I face that familiar void again, this time full of uncertainty but excitement about who he will become. The little boy is leaving.• ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_105,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°America’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan is one of many blights on the Biden administration’s spotty record. The fact that this nation since then has turned its back on Afghans who helped U.S. troops only makes the matter worse.But there is a remedy for this injustice.Since the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan more than two years ago, the United States has welcomed more than 80,000 refugees from the country. Some have relocated to Southern Nevada.But the humanitarian program that allowed them to come here provides only temporary protection and no road to permanent residency. In addition, thousands of Afghans who aided the American war effort remain at risk in their home country, unable to cut through the red tape and flee to the United States. They and their families are targets for retribution from the brutal Taliban.“Helping these Afghans would signify to other allies that the U.S. doesn’t abandon its friends,” Sierra Dawn McClain wrote in the Wall Street Journal this week. “More important, it would help settle the moral debt America incurred with its botched withdrawal.”In July, a bipartisan group of senators reintroduced the Afghan Adjustment Act, which had previously stalled in Congress. It would, The New York Times reports, “allow Afghans who have short-term humanitarian parole status — which typically lasts for two years — to apply for permanent legal status if they submit to additional vetting, including an interview.”The original bill ran into roadblocks, primarily from Republicans, over security concerns involving immigrants who hadn’t been adequately screened and the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of transparency about the process.The updated version of the bill addresses those concerns and has earned significant GOP support. Yet Congress remains distracted by various issues, most recently the government shutdown. Meanwhile, the lack of certainty for many refugees currently in the United States makes it impossible for them to set down roots and discourages employers from hiring them.It’s true that, in the aftermath of our withdrawal from Afghanistan, there were problems with the vetting process and some undesirables took advantage of this. But as Times columnist Farah Stockman noted, the legislation in question is “one of the most promising ways to ensure that evacuees are rigorously vetted. The legislation requires additional screening for those who apply for permanent residency.”The Afghan Adjustment Act offers members of Congress the opportunity to show voters they can come together for an important cause.They should pass the bill this year.

It incorrectly identified myself as a principal of a Geothermal PIG (permitted interaction group and incorrectly stated that I was a member of Waika Consulting. This reporting was false. I am not a consultant to Waika, but I am a supporter of renewable energy, including geothermal and hydrogen.Hawaii cannot achieve renewable energy self-sufficiency in the immediate future. The development of geothermal renewable energy was proposed yeas ago, but culturally appropriate development was not pursued. Instead, political influence was pursued. The first site chosen was the sacred location of Kilauea. That failed due to native opposition, and millions of dollars later another site was selected, it was Wao Kele o Puna, Pele’s sacred forest. Over 1,000 people marched to oppose the site, and several kupuna were arrested and taken to jail.The first geothermal plant was developed on private land. No other plant has ever been developed in Hawaii. Since that time, Hawaii Island residents have experienced numerous shutdowns, evacuations and incidents of closures due to toxic fumes allegedly due to outdated technology.It’s time to recognize that Hawaiians and the public own geothermal energy, which is a mineral under Hawaii law. The old rubric — Hawaii develops its renewable geothermal energy to benefit private equity investors from abroad, and the pubic and native owners of the resource reap the highest electricity bills in the nation — is no longer acceptable.It’s time for a change. This time around, Hawaiians should be directly involved. As owners of geothermal renewable energy resources, Hawaiians need to be at the equity table. Only then will we have the power to determine how development should proceed, where it should occur, and what technology should be used to ensure clean and safe energy for Hawaii and food security for our residents, Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian alike.In addition, there are other critical concerns that need to be considered when geothermal development proceeds. Will government, including OHA and DHHL, utilize geothermal revenues as a dedicated revenue stream for affordable housing for residents? Will state and county players recognize that Hawaii Island will need and should receive a significant share of geo-revenues to fund development of our agricultural and pastoral resources for food security for our island and state in the future? Given the cost for construction, is it time to integrate a plan for the development of Hawaii Island’s basalt minerals for roads, bridges and other infrastructure needs in our state?As County Councilwoman Sue Lee Loy has noted, geothermal development would be a game-changer for the DHHL which has 29,000 Hawaiians living and dying on lists while they await their homestead award. DHHL has carried this burden since its inception. It’s time for the state Legislature to move forward with a renewable energy plan for the state.I opposed geothermal development in the ’70s and ’80s because it was being pursued without the direct involvement of Hawaiians for foreigners with political connections in Washington, D.C., and because there was no benefit or consultation with Hawaiians.The records also reflect that I supported geothermal development when it was proposed and developed by Hawaiians (Huena who had a business model which ensured the development would be culturally appropriate, economically sustainable and socially responsible.I supported that plan and also went to several communities on Hawaii Island and Maui doing community consultations and hosting workshops on a culturally appropriate model for Hawaii and Hawaiians.

We don’t know more about the details of that breakthrough or its precise role in the soap opera that’s consumed the tech world in recent weeks, but we do know that artificial intelligence is advancing at a rapid pace, and our public policy to regulate it is moving at the speed of Washington.We’re sorry, Dave. We’re afraid we can’t have that.What can AI already do? As anyone who’s fiddled with ChatGPT knows, it can write reasonably credible, fact-based essays about fairly complicated questions, and fiction and poetry to boot. It can write computer code. It can transcribe speech and summarize long texts with remarkable accuracy. It can generate photorealistic or stylized images of just about anything. It can aid in the discovery of new medicines. It can take a picture or two of a human face at any age and identify it, almost instantly. It can listen to a person for just a few seconds and then spoof his or her voice.Naysayers are quick to point out the many failures and fumbles and foibles, all the ways in which the tech is not yet ready for deployment. And it’s true; every algorithm makes mistakes, and some make a lot. One AI-enabled innovation, the self-driving car, has been just around the corner for many years now — because the task has proven much more complex than initially thought. (Even still, it’s worth pointing out that autonomous vehicles have made major strides. The unavoidable fact is that human beings have developed and are refining a technology with remarkable capabilities. There’s tremendous good AI can do today and tomorrow, from identifying students in need of additional support services, to helping radiologists detect cancerous growths, to supercharging drug development, to helping blind people make sense of what’s in front of them, to quickly scoping out damage in disaster zones.But like any technology, it can do serious damage as well. Those voice-spoofing capabilities are already being used to steal money. Artists are seeing their creativity exploited and new paintings or songs generated from copyrighted work without their permission. Deepfaked vidoes that, to the naked eye, are indistinguishable from real ones can throw fuel on fires of disinformation — or create nonconsensual pornography. And while well-designed, properly applied AI can help identify and combat human bias, poorly designed algorithms can enable mass bias in hiring, criminal justice and other realms.It is the job of the federal government to prevent foreseeable AI abuses before they happen and design smart penalties for inevitable bad uses, all while ensuring that the are few if any constraints to AI’s many beneficial applications.The White House has released an organically intelligent framework for what sorts of safeguards are needed, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has led the way. The billionaires who increasingly control this corner of the economy can’t be trusted to regulate themselves.

suffolknewsherald_2023_243,"Published 5:15 pm Friday, July 14, 2023ByStaff ReportsSuffolk is a dynamic and beautiful community that is growing. With any growing community, access to additional services and improving older communities must ensure that all citizens benefit from the growth.Supporting our open space and agricultural areas are values that we represent. However, we also recognize that the increase in population requires expanded housing, shopping and job opportunities. According to a recent report by the Weldon Cooper Center, Suffolk has the most significant population percent increase between 2020 to 2022.The April 2020 census shows the city’s population at 94,324. After the 2022 listing, Suffolk had a population of 99,179. This represents a 5.1% increase.As more people choose Suffolk as their home, the need for additional opportunities for access to fresh fruits and vegetables has to go beyond farmer markets.Many citizens, including myself and most older neighborhoods downtown, live in a food desert.Food deserts are marked by a need for more stores selling healthy food in local areas. The issue of equitable food access is a year-round issue that cannot be solved with temporary markets. Grocery stores choose communities based on many factors, including the number of rooftops in the target areas.While serving as Suffolk’s parks and recreation director (2003-2018 , I was honored to lead the planning and development of many diverse recreation opportunities.During this time, I also served on the Executive Committee for Peanut Festival and led the first Taste of Suffolk implementation. I envisioned the Taste of Suffolk as a jump start to additional opportunities for citizens to gather downtown to support the business community long term. However, many vacant buildings remain on Main and Washington streets, and our current businesses must reach their full potential.Downtown has the potential to be a thriving business community supported by citizens and visitors. It is challenging to achieve this vibrant community. But we can create a more inclusive approach to growth while maintaining what we have and increasing in areas we need.Suffolk’s Peanut or agriculture heritage is not under siege by the development community, but by not addressing the “market” via training more professionals in the agricultural sciences and management fields. Currently, the growth areas are identified in the city’s comprehensive plan. When implementing the plan is challenged by the old mindset of NIMBY — Not in My BackYard, we will not improve our roads, expand our businesses, increase our jobs, or improve our community. When the vision of developing housing options, inviting companies, and expanding industries are limited to the perspective of one group of people, it negatively impacts the entire city.If we consider our city a diamond in the “rough,” it has to undergo a process that includes pressure (growth , resulting in the beautiful stone (vibrant neighborhoods and businesses .

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_29,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°You probably know what a “zombie lie” is, but, just in case, it’s an idea or proposition or theory that is demonstrably, logically and intuitively false but which, like a zombie, refuses to die. And it will eat your brain.The term’s origin is uncertain, but I associate it with Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, who uses it to describe certain right-wing economic theories, such as the idea that the federal government can increase revenue by cutting taxes on the wealthy.This notion isn’t logical, and, in fact, Krugman, other economists and experience have demonstrated that it doesn’t work.Yet Republicans continue to embrace it, as embodied in the 2017 Trump tax cuts that mostly benefited the wealthy. By the way, during Donald Trump’s administration, the national debt increased by nearly $8 trillion.Still, the idea won’t die. Like a zombie. Maybe this is why President George H.W. Bush called it “voodoo economics.”Then there’s the election denial zombie lie. Former President Donald Trump contended that the 2020 election was rigged before, during and after it occurred. He hasn’t stopped, and he’s beguiled nearly 70% of his party into saying that they believe the same, despite the lack of evidence. In fact, considerable evidence puts the lie to the election denial zombie lie. But it lives on.These two zombie lies are dangerous. The first one channels money to the already wealthy, who, in turn, channel money back to politicians who accept and propagate the lie, undermining equality and equity in our society.The second zombie lie damages our republic; if we don’t believe in the validity of elections and the peaceful transfer of power, what sort of future does democracy have in our country?But the third zombie lie can kill us. Literally.This lie surfaces after every mass shooting, as it did last month after 18 people were killed during youth night at a bowling alley and at a bar in Lewiston, Maine.Here’s how Sean Hannity expressed it during an interview with new House Speaker Mike Johnson: “If somebody really wants to kill innocent people, there’s a lot of ways they can do it beyond using a gun.” He found a compliant audience in Johnson, who said, dismissively: “In Europe and in other places they use vehicles to mow down crowds at parades…it’s not the weapon, it’s the underlying problem…”The heart of this particular zombie lie is the idea that the type of weapon used by a killer is irrelevant. If someone wants to kill, he could use a baseball bat or an ax or a paperweight or, as some right-wing radio commentators put it, a butterknife or a No. 2 pencil. Yes, they actually said that.But you can be assured of the absurdity of this lie by asking yourself whether you would rather be trapped in a bowling alley with a deranged killer wielding a baseball bat or even a six-shooter or one with a high-powered assault rifle with several 30-round magazines.In terms of killing capacity, an assault rifle has the same relationship to the muskets of 1789 as a Lamborghini has to an oxcart. High-capacity, semiautomatic weapons make mass shootings possible, and they make law enforcement’s response to them much more difficult and dangerous. Would police officers have hesitated for 74 minutes before taking on the shooter who massacred 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, if he had been armed only with an ax? Unlikely.How do these zombie lies continue to rise from the dead like Lazarus and Jesus when they do our society so much harm?First, they require people who really, really want to believe them. In the case of these three zombie lies, a minority of the citizenship—the rich, the fervent right wing as embodied in the cult of Trump, the gun fetishists as embodied in the National Rifle Association—is sufficient.And zombie lies require an indifferent or compliant majority.Therefore, wealth inequality grows, mass shootings persist and, if we’re not careful, Donald Trump will reclaim the presidency, insisting that American democracy was rigged all along.John M.

philinquirer_2023_9,"The Republican plan is an inherently racist tactic to reduce the number of African American voters and make the state s electorate whiter, richer, and older. Even afterwinning a slim majority in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Democrats could be on the verge of a significant electoral defeat later this year that could make it harder for the most vulnerable among us to vote. In the November election, Democrats won more seats than Republicans in the state House for the first time in a dozen years. But two of those victorious Democrats — incumbents Austin Davis and Summer Lee, both of Allegheny County — also successfully ran for other offices (Davis for lieutenant governor and Lee for Congress andresigned from the House last monthto take their new posts. Another Democratic incumbent, State Rep. Tony DeLuca, also of Allegheny County, won reelection eventhough he died in October(state law prevented him from being removed from the ballot . That left Republicans with a slim, albeit temporary majority — and the GOP used it for all it was worth. Republican lawmakers cut a deal withMark Rozzi, a Berks County Democrat with a singular focus on creating a constitutional amendmentto help adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Rozzi, who has said he suffered such abuse as a child, was nominated by the GOP as speaker of the House, and Democrats went along with it. Now, with Rozzi in place and willing to play ball to get his own legislation passed, Republicans have introduced a constitutional amendment of their own.They want a referendum on voter ID, and if they get it, Democrats may never win a majority in the state legislature again. That’s because voter ID — a rule that would require Pennsylvanians to show identification every time they vote — is a particularlyinsidious form of voter suppression. It is designed to make the electorate whiter, richer, and older. Such people are more likely to have identification, and they are also more likely to vote Republican. But make no mistake — voter ID is more than a political tool; it is an inherently racist tactic usedto reduce the number of Black voters. » READ MORE:As Election Day approaches, political violence escalates and America’s racist history repeats itself | Solomon Jones The American Civil Liberties Union saysup to 25% of voting-age Black Americans lack government-issued identification cards, compared with just 8% of their white counterparts. Proponents will argue that requiring voter ID in the face of such racial disparity is about maintaining the integrity of elections. After two years of Donald Trump’s lies about voter fraud, such reasoning will attract millions of Pennsylvania voters. Need proof? Look no further than Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, who parroted Trump’s prevarication and gotmore than 2.2 million votes. Therefore, if Republicans can successfully get voter ID on the ballot, the Trump-Mastriano demographic will support it, and Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro can’t stop it with a veto, becausePennsylvania governors can’t block ballot questions on constitutional amendments. The implementation of voter ID would siphon away Black political power, and that is the point. Denying the basic rights of Black people is a time-honored tradition in America, and there is seemingly always someone willing to help. In this case, it’s newly elected state House Speaker Mark Rozzi, who wants a constitutional amendment to help adult victims of child sexual abuse and is apparently willing to help push voter ID to get it. Though the consequences aren’t as pernicious or far-reaching, this deal reminds me of theCompromise of 1877, in which Democrats vowed to withdraw their objections to the disputed results of the 1876 presidential election if Republicans promised to remove federal troops from the South. The agreement sent Rutherford B. Hayes to the White House and effectively ended Reconstruction. In the years that followed, Southern whites began a reign of terror against emancipated African Americans. Is Rozzi, like Hayes, poised to sacrifice Black American progress on the altar of political power? If so, everyone who believes in democracy in the commonwealth must fight back. » READ MORE:In Congress and the courts, America’s vision of itself faces a challenge | Solomon Jones Pennsylvanians beat back voter ID in 2012, when 93-year-old Viviette Applewhite, a Black woman from the South who did not have a legally acceptablebirth certificate, was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit in Commonwealth Court in which a judge ruled that a GOP-crafted version of the law was unconstitutional. In North Carolina, the state Supreme Court saw the state’s voter ID law for what it was, and in December, deemed it unconstitutional. “We hold that the three-judge panel’s findings of fact are supported by competent evidence showing that the statute was motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose,” said the89-page ruling, penned by Associate Justice Anita Earls, as reported by the Washington Post. “The provisions enacted … were formulated with an impermissible intent to discriminate against African American voters in violation of the North Carolina Constitution.” In Pennsylvania, we must also look beyond the GOP’s surface explanations and see voter ID for what it is. Only then can we move forward in the spirit of democracy, where everyone has an equal opportunity to cast a ballot."
eugeneweekly_2023_48,"We ve got issues. Renter protections are consumer protections, and right now renters in Eugene are being squeezed until they fall into homelessness. On March 13, the Eugene City Council will convene a hearing to discuss a package of renter protections. This package includes a homelessness prevention measure called Displacement Prevention Assistance (DPA , in addition to caps on security deposits and requirements to process rental applications in the order received. While I support all three of these proposals, I’d like to focus here on how no-cause evictions harm vulnerable members of our community and how DPA can help prevent and mitigate these harms. In 2011, I was a student at the University of Oregon when I received a no-cause termination notice that gave me 30 days to move out. As I searched for a new home, I was surprised to see my current unit advertised at a substantially higher monthly rent. I was unable to find new housing and pay a security deposit on such short notice, so I became homeless for several months. Eventually, I found stable housing after saving up for a few months. A few years later, in 2015, I was given another no-cause termination. My landlord planned to renovate the unit in order to charge higher rent. I wiped out my entire savings to get into my next place. Just a year later, in 2016, my landlord passed away. The estate no-cause evicted us in order to sell the property. I couch surfed for four months until I could find another affordable unit. No-cause evictions are happening nearly every day in our community. The Springfield Eugene Tenant Association publishes a monthly hotline report that provides sobering data regarding no-cause eviction in our town: In 2022, 259 tenants received a no-cause termination notice or faced a no-cause eviction proceeding. Each time, the landlord makes a business decision in order to charge more rent or sell their asset in a thriving real estate market, while the financial burden imposed by no-cause eviction falls on the tenant. In my case, I was unable to come up with money to move on short notice and became homeless. This struggle is not unique. Many renters,especially seniorsand people with disabilities who live independently on Social Security, are extremely unlikely to be able to come up with first, last and a new deposit within 90 days. Even with the statutorily required notice, when tenants are forced to leave their homes through no fault of their own, the economic consequences are severe and put individuals and families at extreme risk of homelessness. DPA seeks to address this inequity by balancing the financial scales while preserving landlord’s property rights. DPA requires landlords to pay tenants three months of fair market rent when the landlord issues either a no-cause termination notice, or a rent increase that causes the tenant to move. This financial assistance will allow the tenant to find a comparable housing unit on short notice while protecting a landlord’s right to make business decisions about their property. It puts the cost of that business decision on the party who reaps the benefits and dramatically reduces the chance the tenant falls into homelessness. DPA is an upstream solution that our City Council can implement with little cost to the taxpayer. Portland adopted a similar policy in 2019 and saw a dramatic decrease in reports of no-cause eviction, while experiencing a significant increase of new rental housing developments. The Portland measure was challenged in court twice and was upheld by the Oregon Supreme Court in November 2021. Just last month, Los Angeles passed a DPA measure that is even more progressive than Portland or Eugene’s proposal. DPA has a proven track record of success and is being adopted by cities up and down the West Coast. Consumer protection is a common and necessary function of our government. The Eugene City Council must pass Displacement Prevention Assistance and the other provisions of Phase 2 Renter Protections. Kevin C. Cronin is an organizer with Eugene Tenant Alliance, a political action committee that fights for tenants."

It is unfortunate to say today, there is a rising duty to help protect the students and families that attend these activities. The families present during these occasions need to have a sense of security and the reassurance of safety measures in the event of a shooting.I am asking our city’s legislators and school board officials to have a meeting with the city’s police department to discuss how we could implement more precautions at our sporting events.

philinquirer_2023_16,"Editorials In a message Wednesday that overhyped the benefits of the arena while breezing past the very real challenges, Cherelle L. Parker announced her support of the 76ers proposal. There were 231 incidents of domestic terrorism between 2010 and 2021. Since 2020, the number of FBI domestic terrorism investigations has more than doubled. With roughly two months to go in what is expected to be a close election, voters need the media and debate moderators to treat Trump as the serious threat he is. The Del. House of Representatives minority leader styles himself as a Pete DuPont Republican, rather than a MAGA devotee. Corrupt cops and misconduct undermine the good work of dedicated officers. It also creates more distrust among residents in high-crime neighborhoods that need quality police work the most. Since the former president can’t run on his record, there is a growing danger as he fires up his MAGA followers with calls for violence, jailing foes, and wild conspiracies. The impasse is an opportunity for Mayor Cherelle L. Parker and City Council to act as honest brokers in a compromise that would enhance Market Street while protecting the adjacent area. At the start of his third school year, Superintendent Tony B. Watlington Sr. is overseeing important curriculum changes and the promise of year-round school. The presidential candidates offer voters dueling visions: a strong and united country where all have an opportunity to succeed, or a nation riven by fear-mongering and hate. People continue to needlessly die and get injured on the city’s watch. Share your thoughts on Donald Trump with The Inquirer Editorial Board. Meyer has detailed and extensive plans to fix problems in Delaware’s education system, as well as the demonstrated political skill to get it done. Managing Director Adam Thiel, who moonlights as a well-paid consultant, is just the latest example of public servants with private interests. Most Republican officials, and many in the media, ignore or downplay Donald Trump’s peculiar state of mind, but normalizing his unhinged musings is dangerous. Despite its imperfections, when it comes to reducing bad behavior on transit, policing works. Harris’ selection of Minnesota Gov.

eugeneweekly_2023_33,"We ve got issues. Eugene is known for its vibrant, quirky community, beautiful scenery and a deep passion for sports. As the home of the Eugene Emeralds for nearly 70 years, our city has enjoyed a rich baseball tradition once embodied by historic Civic Stadium, now the site of south Eugene’s Kidsports Complex. Now, due to their own success in both winning games and building a loyal fan base, our Eugene Emeralds face an existential crisis: They must get the city of Eugene and Lane County to help finance construction of a new stadium or they will be forced to move to a new city that will meet the facility requirements for having a High-A affiliate minor league team. The city of Eugene should embrace this opportunity and build a new stadium for the Eugene Emeralds. New infrastructure projects such as stadiums come with sometimes shocking price tags, and asking the city to find millions in additional funding at a time when parts of the city’s budget is facing budget cuts is a tough sell. But infrastructure investments not only take revenue, they make revenue. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. A new stadium will provide a significant boost to the local economy and will help revitalize West 13th Avenue, which has fallen into disrepair over the past few decades. The construction phase alone would generate jobs and stimulate the local labor market. Additionally, a modern stadium will attract more visitors to the heart of Eugene, providing a much-needed lifeline to other ongoing efforts to revitalize the city center. Restaurants, hotels and retail establishments near the stadium will flourish, leading to higher revenue and job creation and, most importantly, less crime. Sports have a unique ability to unite communities and create a sense of belonging — especially minor league baseball, which remains one of the only family friendly budget options left in town. While a game at Autzen Stadium for a Ducks football game requires a family of four to spend hundreds of dollars, a pleasant night at the ballpark with refreshments is less than $100 total. The Emeralds community serves as a gathering space for people from all walks of life, fostering a strong sense of community. Families, friends and neighbors come together to support the Emeralds, forging new friendships and strengthening social bonds. Moreover, the stadium could host other events such as concerts, community fairs and youth sports tournaments, ensuring it remains a hub of activity year-round. By building a new stadium, Eugene would be investing long term in the social fabric of our community. A new stadium for the Emeralds would have a profound impact on the local youth. In minor league call, aspiring baseball players from Babe Ruth programs get the opportunity to witness professional baseball up close and be inspired to pursue their dreams. The Emeralds collaborate with local schools and community organizations to offer educational programs, mentorship opportunities and youth leagues. Minor league baseball provides a beacon of hope for at-risk youth by fostering a love for sports and promoting healthy lifestyles among the next generation. Building a new stadium for the Eugene Emeralds is an investment in the future of the city, its residents and the baseball community. It would invigorate the local economy, strengthen the social fabric of the community, enhance the fan experience and promote youth development.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_129,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Sometimes, it seems that we’re doing all we can to sabotage our own efforts to reverse the nation’s mental health and addiction crises, which disproportionately affect children, teens and young adults. Particularly here in Illinois, where we’re on pace to surpass our current record highs in overdose deaths, and youth suicide lifeline programs are struggling to keep up with overwhelming demand.There is so much dismal news about young people struggling with mental health problems, suicide, fentanyl, vaping, social media, pornography and online gambling. Yet we continue to overlook one of the most effective and expedient ways to address these problems: regulatory action to curb youth exposure and access to addictive, unhealthy influences purportedly meant for adults only.Decades of scary commercials about smoking-related lung problems did less to shift the trajectory of youth smoking than enacting smoke-free or “clean air” laws and tax hikes that dissuaded youths from buying cigarettes. Hours of lectures to school kids about the risks of e-cigarettes did less to stabilize the frightening spike in youth vaping than did government bans on certain flavored vapes and reduced access to brands that were most popular with kids at the time.Protecting addiction-for-profit businesses with our policies has the opposite impact: Current research demonstrates that the marijuana industry systematically advertises to youths and that the more available marijuana is and the more exposure youths have to those advertisements, the more they tend to use THC products or view getting high as “normal” teen behavior. The same holds true for nicotine. Vaping companies are using the classic Big Tobacco marketing playbook, and the more that youths are exposed to vaping ads, the greater their likelihood of vaping. And no matter how much we claim that marijuana or gambling legalization applies only to adults, ubiquitous ads on social media, provocative c annabis billboards on the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway, clever marketing and celebrity promotions have made marijuana use and online betting routine activities for teens and emerging adults.Regardless of the substance or activity, a regulatory agenda dictated primarily by the industries that most stand to profit from loose regulations harms young people. The need to change criminal justice policies that have historically led to disproportionate and inequitable punishments for marginalized and disadvantaged communities must not be conflated with government support for the commercialization and normalization of addictive substances and behaviors.These policies harm public health and disproportionately harm young people, who are neurologically more vulnerable to addiction than adults. Whereas it’s obvious that we need to reform our drug laws in this country and have a less paternalistic and inequitable regulatory system, legalization of addictive products and behaviors in the United States inevitably leads to unbridled commercialization and costly and harmful consequences to the most vulnerable among us, especially kids.Despite knowing this and repeatedly having to pay the price for forgetting the lessons we should have learned from allowing industry marketing to speed ahead of sensible regulations, we continually make way for new addictive products and services that are detrimental to them. Whether it’s social media, nicotine vaping, online betting, flavored alcohol drinks or high-potency THC edibles, we let for-profit industries normalize their use, reduce perception of their harm and increase youth access in ways that directly and undoubtedly influence children’s health and well-being.None of this is to say that products and services such as these should be banned. But if they are for adults, as the law and common sense say they should be, there must be higher and stronger guardrails in place to ensure they are not available to children and teens. Also, enforceable regulations should be in place to prevent their marketing, sale and appeal to minors.Many people believe or argue that it’s the sole responsibility of parents to safeguard children from products and services that are legal for adults to use. But how difficult we choose to make this task for parents is up to us, and anyone who has raised a child knows that the financial interests aligned against parents in this regard are mighty.It’s time to back up our words with action and stand behind our purported concern for the well-being of youths with effective regulatory actions. We must prevent well-financed, profit-driven enterprises from enticing teens with all manner of child-friendly tactics and instead implement effective and well-enforced guardrails around the marketing and sale of addiction to kids.Aaron Weiner, Ph.D., is a licensed clinical psychologist and addiction specialist from Lake Forest.

From our sister paper in Tampa, Creative Loafing, we’re happy to share the Oracle of Ybor, written by Caroline DeBruhl. Here you may submit your questions about life, and the tarot will help to guide your answers.Dear Oracle,In my early 20s, I had an eating disorder. Through therapy/growing up, I was able to stop the most active parts of it, and while some of the thoughts never entirely went away, they were subdued. However, now I’m in my mid-30s, and my body is changing in ways I don’t like. I’m finding those ED thoughts returning and thinking about my old patterns of how I used to lose weight. Any advice on how to navigate these thoughts?—ExhaustEDCards: Death, Two of Pentacles (rev. , Five of Cups (rev. Dear E,You have to kill your eating disorder. Brutally, violently, and ideally with the help of an eating disorder therapist. That’s the flat truth of it with the Death card: this has to end, and you need guidance from a professional grim reaper.We do not live in a society that supports people, especially women, trying to white-knuckle their eating disorder recovery. We just don’t. “Diet culture” has saturated our conversations about health and body size, “diet advice” is rife with tips for disordered eating, and the vast majority of people (from strangers on the internet to concerned friends to non-ED trained therapists/doctors don’t really know how to talk about eating disorders without saying something fucked up.It’s a unique disease that requires delicate care, and again, I strongly encourage you to find a therapist or counselor trained to do this kind of work. A recovery support group might also be helpful for you, especially since it can be such an isolating disease.I do think you’ve been trying to balance this for a long time by yourself. That reversed Two of Pentacles points to you trying to keep your balls in the air. And while I think you’ve done a stand-up job keeping those thoughts subdued. But, as you say, they never quite went away, and I think that’s what this Five of Cups represents.The Five of Cups is a card that can feel like emotional devastation. In it, there are five chalices of wine, three of which are knocked over. Often, there’s a figure weeping over the spilled wine. In these instances, it can feel like everything is ruined. The wine is spilled; it’s never going back into those cups. Similarly, I wonder if you’ve treated those lingering ED thoughts as something that will always be at the back of your mind.But the Five of Cups is deceitful. There are still two cups full of wine at the ready. All hope is not lost. I hope that with help, you can eradicate those lingering thoughts and turn away from the spilled wine to the two cups that are still brimming. I don’t know what full recovery would look like to you, but I so hope you’re able to find it. I know it won’t be easy. I know you are going to battle with a powerful adversary but I hope, with help and guidance, that you can strike that fucker dead.Godspeed you, darling.Dear Oracle,I’m concerned right now about money. There are a lot of expenses coming up, and my partner hasn’t been able to bring in as much money as they once did due to job changes. I want to talk to them about it, but I know it’s a very sensitive subject, and I don’t want to hurt their feelings. How should I proceed?—Feelin’ Funny About MoneyCards: King of Wands, Two of Cups, Six of Swords (all reversed. Dear Feelin’,According to daytime TV, money is the number #1 cause of divorce in America and arguments among couples. I don’t know if that’s backed up by data, but I do know that having wealth is a source of great pride for many people, and lacking it can be a source of shame and stress, so I believe the talk shows.I want to start with the middle card in the spread, the Two of Cups. You and your partner are equal in the relationship, emotionally speaking. You are both all in and there for each other. This balance is not going to change. However, as many people in long-term relationships can attest to, things like money/labor are rarely equal at all times. You might make more money now, but they might get a better job and out-earn you next year. Someone might get sick and need to take time off, someone might go back to school, etc., etc. It might feel unfair right now, but it won’t last forever.The Six of Swords is a time of transition —often uncomfortable—that usually involves shedding old ideas and expectations to reach a new future. If this is about your partner’s career, then they are in the process of making some moves. It’ll pay off as long as they stick with it and don’t cave into inertia.This is all well and good, but how do you speak to them about these issues now when you’re stressed out? You do so as the King of Wands: warmly, encouragingly, and with some light-handed direction. Remember, you two are partners. It’s ok to talk about things that stress you out, and you can acknowledge that your current financial state is less than ideal without blaming your partner for your stress. (Use “I” statements! It is a sensitive subject, but that doesn’t mean you must keep your thoughts to yourself. Share with your partner—but, you know, tactfully.If you want them to pursue another avenue of income (part-time job, an additional gig , do so lightly. A couple of suggestions can be helpful. A lot of suggestions that start with “you should” is patronizing. Remember: this is coming from a place of love and equality.I’m sorry for the stressful time. Hopefully, this is just temporary. It’s a bumpy boat ride for now, but with (tactful honesty and mutual respect, I think you two can weather this storm.Best of luck, my dear.Subscribe to LEO Daily newsletters.|NewsBreak (coming soon ||||| ( ."

Will the Biden administration make the same mistake?It was August 2012 when Obama, running for a second term in the Oval Office, held a news conference and fielded a question about the ongoing civil war in Syria. The president said that he had so far avoided U.S. military intervention but that his calculations would change if Syria crossed a “red line” and used chemical weapons.A year later, a chemical weapons attack believed to have been carried out by the regime of Bashar al-Assad killed 1,400 people near Damascus. Obama did little about his “red line” but eventually cut a deal with Vladimir Putin and Russia to have Syria turn over its chemical stockpiles to international inspectors. The agreement was a failure, the victim — as The Atlantic later put it — “of Syrian deception, Russian duplicity and American dithering.”Fast forward to this month in the wake of the horrific Hamas terror attack on Israel. As the Jewish state prepares for a ground invasion of Gaza, militant groups threaten to escalate the conflict and have even targeted American forces. In recent days, Iranian-backed groups in the region “launched 10 drone and rocket attacks against bases that U.S. troops use in Iraq and three on a U.S. base in southeast Syria.”In response, the United States has ramped up the rhetoric. “My warning to the Ayatollah,” President Joe Biden said, “was that if they continue to move against” U.S. troops in the Middle East, “we will respond. And he should be prepared.”These warnings are appropriate as an exercise in deterrence. But this administration’s fiasco in Afghanistan and the Obama administration’s “red line” still haunt American diplomacy. It’s highly likely that the resolve of the Biden White House will be tested by Iranian-backed terrorists in the region. Is Biden prepared to follow through? Or will he speak loudly and carry a small stick?— Las Vegas Review-Journal"
suffolknewsherald_2023_111,"Published 5:16 pm Friday, February 24, 2023ByStaff ReportsBy Tonya Sinclair SwindellReading and writing are privileges that I sometimes take for granted. Writing is therapy for me and reading stimulates me in ways no other activity can. My motivation to read and write is amplified when I think about the number of African-American women who were legally denied rights but were fortunate enough to excel anyway. Despite anti-literacy laws that were in effect centuries before me, it gives me great pride to know about two women who excelled at reading and writing and made history while doing it.When thinking about the implications of anti-literacy laws, or laws put in place between 1740 and 1834 that prohibited slaves and former slaves from reading and writing, one must consider reasons why such laws were enacted. Knowledge is power. And when access to knowledge is denied, so is the power to effectively change one’s situation.Although blacks were ingenious enough to pass down information in multiple ways including through the use of oral history, songs, quilt making and symbolism, not allowing slaves and former slaves to read and write hindered their ability to communicate ideas in a deeper, more effective way. Anti-literacy laws also gave slave owners greater control. Such control added to the dependency with which blacks were made to rely on whites for their livelihood, well-being and education. In light of those circumstances, it is amazing to consider how black women overcame the odds.Phyllis Wheatley and Harriett Jacobs were two African-American female authorsrecognized in history not only because of their race and gender but also because of their status as former slaves. According towww.womenshistory.org, Phyllis Wheatley was born around 1753 in Gambia, Africa before being captured by slave traders and brought to America in 1761. She was sold to the Wheatley family of Boston, Massachusetts. Despite spending much of her life as an enslaved person, Wheatley is recognized as the first African-American woman to publish a book of poetry which was titled, “Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral.” The book included a foreword by John Hancock and other Boston notables. Ms. Wheatley was emancipated from slavery shortly after publishing her book.According to Wikipedia, Harriett Ann Jacobs, was born in 1813 or 1815 in Edenton, North Carolina. She was a former enslaved woman who, like Wheatley, learned to read and write from members of her owner’s family. Jacobs wrote about her life as a slave and managed to get her autobiography published in 1861 under the pseudonym Linda Brent. The title of her book was “Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.” It is an excellent book that is even more endearing to me because most of the pivotal events of Jacobs’ story occurred a short distance from the Hampton Roads area.Reading and writing has become therapy for me — an opportunity to learn, grow and express my emotions in a safe space while helping others. Those skills are especially significant because of my knowledge that African-American women like myself did not always have the privilege to learn them. Therefore, I appreciate the fortitude, tenacity and bravery with which Phyllis Wheatley, Harriett Jacobs and others made meaningful strides in those areas. Their accomplishments also encourage me to improve, develop and excel in the areas of reading and writing.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_8,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Republican presidential candidate former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley on stage during a break in the NBC News Republican Presidential Primary Debate at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County on Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2023, in Miami. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images/TNS Given Donald Trump’s stubborn standing atop polls of Republican voters, there may be no more meaningless exercise in futility right now than even talking about the rest of the GOP presidential field, let alone tentatively backing one candidate in that field.Still, a lot could happen between now and the bulk of the primaries this spring: Trump could be criminally convicted, or his age and health could become an issue, or (perhaps least likely his supporters could come to their senses. You never know.So it’s worth noting that Sen. Tim Scott’s withdrawal from the primary contest, while disappointing in one way, is, in another, progress toward the urgent outcome of narrowing the field of Republican candidates not named Trump to just one serious opponent of the former president.Of the remaining candidates, our preference would be Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and former U.N. ambassador — though virtually any of the others would be preferable to the nightmare scenario of another Trump presidential term.Trump reminded the world of the stakes on Saturday, when he chose a Veterans Day speech to vow he would “root out” the “vermin” who oppose him politically. He added that “our threat is from within,” suggesting that the many Americans who don’t support him are more dangerous to the nation than Russia, China or North Korea.As historians were quick to point out, that kind of inflammatory, dehumanizing rhetoric against swaths of one’s own fellow citizens is straight out of the playbooks of Hitler and Mussolini.Not that anyone thinks Trump has enough of a grasp of history to specifically know what he’s mimicking — but that, in its way, is the point. Whether it’s calling for the suspension of the Constitution or plotting to use the military against domestic protesters or threatening to execute his political opponents, Trump instinctively speaks the language of tyrants. And as he demonstrated on Jan. 6, 2021, it isn’t empty talk.Future historians (and perhaps psychologists will wrestle with the question of why such a patently and dangerously unfit candidate has such a seemingly unshakable base of support among Republican voters.But he does, with polling averages showing him with well above 50% support within the party and 40 points or more ahead of his nearest challengers.Barring some unforeseen event that fundamentally alters that situation, Trump will be the 2024 GOP nominee.His likeliest Democratic opponent in the general election is President Joe Biden, who, as we and others have warned, is viewed as too old for the job by so many Americans that issue alone poses a genuine danger of throwing the race to Trump.So it is that the remaining Republican primary candidates challenging Trump — as irrelevant as they currently seem to be — are worth reviewing.Scott announced Sunday he is suspending his campaign, after languishing in the single digits in polling with no apparent path forward. Scott had displayed a level of civility and positivity that was otherwise notably lacking in this largely nihilistic field.But as with Mike Pence before him, Scott’s electoral math wasn’t working and wasn’t going to, so leaving the stage to allow voters to coalesce around someone with a better chance against Trump was the best option.Of the remaining candidates, only Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are polling at more than a whisper. But both remain so far behind Trump that the breathless media speculation about whether Haley can depose DeSantis for second place sounds especially pointless.Again, though, there’s no telling what might happen with a frontrunner who has been criminally indicted four times. In light of that, we hope the other also-rans will continue clearing the stage for Haley.DeSantis’ slow-motion collapse in the polls is a gratifying development regarding the one candidate who has demonstrated a streak of cruelty that might approach Trumpian levels. No one should forget that DeSantis lured unsuspecting undocumented migrants from Texas (apparently, no human pawns were available in his own state to be flown to Martha’s Vineyard as a putrid partisan stunt against a politically liberal enclave.This is exactly the kind of man who, if it served his demagogic purposes, would cage children at the border — and, chillingly, he would probably be more efficient and competent about it than Trump was.Haley shows none of that cruel streak. Like most Republicans today, she generally opposes abortion rights, but at least she appears to understand it’s too complex an issue to dismiss with unthinking inflexibility. Her support for continued aid to Ukraine against its Russian invaders shames so many in her party who so myopically oppose it, or who (like DeSantis equivocate.Unlike entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Haley isn’t an annoying, pathetic political circus barker trying to pass off flash as substance.Unlike former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Haley appears to be serious about seeking the presidency and isn’t merely on stage to redeem herself in history by performatively lashing at Trump.That said, a little more lashing on Haley’s part would suit her well; her refusal to call out Trump’s various offenses against human decency (it’s not like there aren’t plenty to choose from is maddening, if strategically understandable.What criticism Haley has leveled at him has been about the Trump administration’s spending and other serious policy issues.That doesn’t get at the more pressing reasons why Trump is unfit for office, but at least Haley doesn’t cower from his name as most of the other candidates do.Most of the Editorial Board would disagree with Haley on most policy issues. But with Democrats apparently determined to stick with their risky bet on an incumbent who, despite a generally successful term, might well be unelectable now, the issue of who the Republicans nominate takes on arguably unprecedented importance.The argument is ultimately this: The notion of Haley as president doesn’t spawn nightmares.It’s a sad state of affairs when the bar for acceptability among presidential candidates of one of America’s two major parties is that low — but this is where we are in the Trump era.— St. Louis Post-DispatchHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

Though the White House and other federal leaders decried the change, is it any wonder investors have soured on the country’s long-term prospects? The federal government spent weeks careening toward a shutdown — again.Federal employees, including members of our armed forces, faced the prospect of going without pay for an indeterminate period — again.Lawmakers in Congress bickered incessantly before approving a bill on Tuesday to fund essential operations — again.Washington’s continued dysfunction has real-world consequences, affecting millions of people and tarnishing the nation’s hard-won reputation for economic responsibility. But so long as voters elevate reckless extremists to influential positions and fail to dismiss those unfit to serve, the United States will see this movie play out time and time and time again — to our lasting detriment.As recently as 2011, the various firms and companies which evaluate the country’s fiscal outlook were bullish on America’s future. Markets viewed the United States as a sound investment because they could be confident the federal government would pay its debts.Republicans assumed control of Congress in January 2011 and sought to use the debt ceiling, which is the total amount of debt the U.S. Treasury can accommodate, as leverage to exact cuts in spending. That led to an agreement that narrowly avoided default, but the irresponsible brinkmanship rattled investors.Days after the deal, Standard &Poor’s lowered the nation’s credit rating from AAA (outstanding to AA+ (excellent , citing “America’s governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable” along with the escalating national debt. Officials from both parties pushed back, but failed to heed the agency’s rebuke of how Washington conducts the people’s business.The other two major rating firms, Fitch and Moody’s, expressed a negative outlook but maintained the country’s AAA rating until August, when Fitch announced its downgrade to AA+.“In Fitch’s view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025,” the agency said.Again, the rating firm criticized the behavior of officials who express comfort with allowing the government to default on its obligations. But those concerns fell on deaf ears as a small group of extremist House Republicans ousted Speaker Kevin McCarthy after he struck a deal to avoid a government shutdown through a 47-day continuing resolution.House Republicans squandered 21 of those days trying to elect McCarthy’s replacement.But rather than knuckle down to address this crisis with appropriate urgency, House Republicans held a series of votes last week on unserious proposals made by unserious people such as cutting the White House press secretary’s salary to $1 and defunding the office of the vice president.Only voters can solve this problem by rebuking those who insist on putting partisan politics ahead of the nation’s best interests. Sending extremists to Washington only exacerbates the problem and ensures future turmoil.— The Virginian-Pilot"
eugeneweekly_2023_64,"We ve got issues. It has been said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of civilization or capitalism — which is odd in that civilization and capitalism are bringing about the end of the world. But I think it has begun to dawn on people that the main institutions designed to control nature are weaving the calamity they’ve claimed to protect us from. Meanwhile, the dominance of things as they are, as they continue to develop, may seem irresistible. For example, an ever-more technological society, built on the system’s destruction of nature, may seem inevitable. There certainly are differences among political systems, but there are also fundamentals shared by every modern setup. Elements such as division of labor, domestication, civilization (which always ends up as a parasite consuming its host are not allowed in what passes for political discourse. The monopoly of chatter is about this figure or party versus the opposing ones, enforced by mainstream corporate media and millions (billions? of dollars. Distinctions, to be sure, but without basic difference. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Technology never seems to reverse course, which has to do with the difficulty of challenging the ruling order. German critical theory philosopher Theodor Adorno said that it is futile to look for the factor that is to blame for all the ills of society when that factor is society itself, which never reverts to a less alienating place. Social existence is a totality in our global civilization. Each part goes forward in tandem with every other part, moving together as a whole. The modern world, especially, leaves little room for independent action, oases of freedom. It takes great courage to seize these rare opportunities. Behind the baffling failures of a more and more hollow social reality stands the overall failure of modernity, considered from any angle. The radical shift toward what’s qualitatively different must, as ever, arise from our doubts and our needs. Doubts are inevitable, since contemporary life fails to satisfy most, or all, of our authentic needs. And what need is greater than our hunger for presence, for the primary experience of face-to-face friendship and love, whose absence is the measure of the deepest poverty?"

suffolknewsherald_2023_78,"Published 6:10 pm Tuesday, April 4, 2023ByJen JaquaWorld War II was a thing of the past; however, while technically a time of peace, the tension of war was still found world wide. Russia and communism caused much stress. Several organizational leaders were accused of being communist.After the use of atomic bombs in Japan at the end of the war, scientists continued to perfect and test the weapons for potential future use. News also came out, whether true or rumored, about various other countries having nuclear weapons. The most concerning, based on news reports, was Russia. Tensions between the United States/United Kingdom and Russia were the beginning of what would come to be known as the Cold War.In late July 1948, President Harry S. Truman issued the second peacetime military draft in the United States, amid increasing tensions with the Soviet Union (the first peacetime draft occurred in 1940 under President Roosevelt . Under the new draft law, 18-year-olds could voluntarily enlist for one year rather than wait to be drafted for a two-year duration. Following the one-year tour, confined to the continental United States, the men had to spend four to six years in an organized reserve unit. All men 18 to 25 had to register for the draft, but could not be drafted until they were 19.Other notable military events found a headline on the front pages of the News-Herald, such as when on July 26, 1948, President Truman signed Executive Order 9981, ending racial segregation in the United States armed forces.The same year, the battle-famed USS Wisconsin was deactivated. This ship is locally well known, as it now sits as a museum in downtown Norfolk.Women began to make the news in the military, as the first woman, in peacetime, was sworn into the armed forces. Also, the VFW organized the Ladies Auxiliary unit.Several times a month, a short story would appear on the front page announcing the homecoming of a fallen war hero. The remains of local military men killed in Europe and the Pacific Islands were transported back to Suffolk for reburial.On April 4, 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in Washington, D.C., creating the NATO defense alliance.Community help was a big thing. At the end of the 1940s, it seems, people went out of their way to help neighbors. Many front-page fundraising campaigns ran during this time for victims of fire. Every campaign mustered hundreds of dollars in addition to clothing and household goods within a few days.A local community group, the Suffolk Lions Club, celebrated its silver anniversary in 1948, (it celebrates its 100th anniversary this year. As part of the celebration, “Moonlight and Roses,” “Drifting and Dreaming” and “Sleep Kentucky Babe” were sung to the crowd. These same songs were sung at its charter night in 1923.Based on headlines, science was making new breakthroughs every day. One area of interest was space. On June 11, 1948, the first monkey astronaut, Albert I, was launched into high subspace. On June 14, 1949, Albert II, a rhesus monkey, became the first primate to enter space but died on impact at return. Astronomers were also studying Mars. One story noted green spots that were observed. It was hypothesized that they could be some form of plant life.Scientists were studying everything, including mosquito bites. “Government people who counted thousands of mosquito bites jotted down these vital statistics on their scratch pads. 1. Mosquitoes scored only five hits in 1,000 dive bombing attacks on a human target clothed in an army field jacket. 2. But the pesky things broke through 690 times in 1,000 strikes against light Navy nylon opposition. 3. After testing 56 kinds of clothing materials, the Agriculture Department’s entomologists (bug and insect specialists came to the sad conclusion that no cloth is skeeter-proof.”Another example of important scientific study was ants. “All ants are not busy. It depends entirely upon which ant you are watching, the American Museum of Natural History scientists say. They’ve just returned from Panama and a five-month study of ant behavior there. They report 40% of the ants spend their time lolling about the nest all day, 40% are good workers and the remainder work just occasionally.”Jen Jaquais the creative director for the Suffolk News-Herald.

suffolknewsherald_2023_146,"Published 5:51 pm Tuesday, November 7, 2023ByStaff ReportsWhile millions of Americans are distracted by the Israel conflict, we have millions of military-aged men coming across our southern border, and the mainstream media turns a blind eye. Why?This is not merely a Texas, Arizona, and California issue. It’s a concern for all Americans. Gov. Youngkin has taken the step of deploying National Guard troops to the border because individuals are entering our communities, potentially acting as sleeper cells on missions. A notable incident involved South American gangs attacking a family in Michigan, which was traced back to the southern border. This could happen to any family, and the situation is only growing more critical and strategic.The Sheriff of Arizona has reported discovering hundreds of identification cards belonging to potential agents from around the world, discarded at the border as they assume new identities within our borders. The sheriffs are left to handle this situation without federal assistance.While our federal government, democrat and Republican, destroys the name of America overseas with the alliance of the dystopia known as globalization and the green colonization by the U.N., let’s not forget that we always were independent until we started playing with Europe again after WW1. It’s time to pull back the guards and think of our nation’s security first, especially when there are foreign alliances at our southern border; the Russian military and Chinese military participated in Mexicos military parade on Sept. 16, 2023. This is not a coincidence.America must secure the nation’s borders and stay out of other countries’ business militarily; the fabric of our nation’s cloth was never globalization. It was cut from the cloth of Independence and Liberty. We must always keep that torch lit and not be provoked into conflict.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_97,"Published 5:39 pm Tuesday, March 14, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardHow do you build a recreational trail from Suffolk to the Atlantic Ocean? A little at a time.Suffolk is gearing up for the next phase of the Seaboard Coastline Trail, which ultimately will be part of a 41-mile-long walking and cycling trail linking the cities of Suffolk, Chesapeake, Portsmouth, Norfolk and Virginia Beach. Yes, one day you’ll be able to ride your bike to the Oceanfront at Virginia Beach. And we’re pretty excited about it.In 2021, Segment II of the Seaboard Coastline Trail was officially opened with a ceremony off Suburban Drive behind the Food Lion shopping center. The 1.5-mile stretch has been a hit with fitness buffs.Now, city officials want your input on the next phase. The Suffolk Parks & Recreation Department will conduct an open house-style public hearing on the project segments dubbed 3C and West. The meeting will be 5-7 p.m. Tuesday, April 4, at the East Suffolk Recreation Center, 138 S. 6th St.Segment 3C is a 2.7-mile segment from Nansemond River High School to the northern end of Segment 3B, about 1.3 miles east of the Route 58 overpass at Nansemond Parkway. Segment West will extend the existing trail 3.3 miles from the end of Prentis Street to Kenyon Road.Suffolk is steadily becoming a more walkable, bike-able community. In a region that has unfortunately been designed to make heavy vehicular travel a necessary part of life, trails are an important way for people to be able to recreate and exercise safely and, eventually, perhaps even get around between home, school, work, shopping opportunities and more without using the roads or turning the keys in a vehicle.Eventually, bikers — and even committed joggers and walkers — will be able to take a paved trail from Suffolk to the oceanfront, with minimal time spent on potentially dangerous roads.Federal grants, along with some local matches, are funding most of the work. In the long run — pardon the pun — this kind of quality-of-life project will generate far more value for the people who use it than it ever cost taxpayers.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

eugeneweekly_2023_4,"We ve got issues. In 1973, the Oregon Legislature ratified the hard-fought victory of visionary governor Tom McCall to protect his state’s farms, forests, natural areas and open spaces by adopting a comprehensive program of land use goals, statutes, plans and codes. In its 50th year, we can celebrate the success of a program that became a model for the nation, but we must also recognize the steady erosion since its inception of protections in land-use law by developer attorneys and agents aided and abetted by anti-regulation, anti-government commissioners, legislators, lobbyists and weak, vulnerable and corrupt state and county administrators and officials. Our success, however, and the strength and integrity of the land-use program are ultimately dependent on a fair-minded body politic making informed decisions in accord with both state and local laws. Nothing could be more rudely antithetical to that ideal than the present majority on the Lane County Board of County Commissioners. As a recent example, West Lane Commissioner Ryan Ceniga, Springfield Commissioner David Loveall and North Eugene Commissioner Pat Farr directed Public Works administrators to send out a Request For Qualifications with the intent to hire an external vendor to assess county barriers to affordable housing, including the county planners. In evaluating an RFQ, Lane County typically selects the lowest priced bid from the vendor deemed most qualified to do the work. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. The county received five quotes ranging from $31,440 to $249,454. Former Lane County Planning Director Kent Howe and Lane County planner Jim Mann submitted a bid of $60,000 with half of it payable upfront when the contract is signed, the only vendor with that provision. The pair offered no examples of relevant former project experience and did not provide the number of hours and costs per hour for their services as required by the RFQ. Howe/Mann worked their entire adult careers as planners in some capacity in Lane County; Howe was planning director for 17 years, and Mann, who said he is retired, is a land development agent who currently has four applications pending for one client before the Land Management Division. By contrast, the vendor with the lowest bid, Morant McLeod, offered several examples of relevant projects in Oregon and, as required, broke down the tasks they would undertake by hours and cost per hour. Because McLeod appears to be eminently qualified and was the lowest bid, Lane County staff recommended them as the preferred vendor and referred their choice in a report to the Board. At the Sept. 26 board meeting, Chair Farr had scarcely finished introducing the agenda item before Commissioner Loveall put forward a motion to hire Howe and Mann as the consultants. The motion was quickly seconded by Commissioner Ceniga. This underhanded maneuver cut off discussion of the other quotes — including their experience, qualifications and cost. There was no discussion of the justification for the selection other than that these ex-Lane County planners had what Loveall characterized as “lived experience.” By immediately introducing the motion, Loveall strategically limited any discussion to the Howe/Mann proposal, foreclosed broader discussion of the merits of other proposals and, thereby, eliminated any consideration of the other vendors. The underlying purpose of the board majority was to select two development facilitators who would recommend changes to county code, changes to state laws and changes to LMD procedures in order to further their goal of eliminating regulations that inhibit the urbanization of rural lands outside urban growth boundaries. Because the selection of Howe/Mann was manifestly unethical and unfair to competitive bidders — not to speak of a waste of taxpayer money — the RFQ should be reissued with clear scoring criteria. Whether we cram another multiplex in a historic neighborhood, fill the sky and block the horizon with multistories or fill wetlands, clearcut trees and pave farmland, we look, as in a mirror, at an image of ourselves we refuse to recognize. The Earth is a commons congested with numbers of people that have exceeded its carrying capacity, and who, even as it degrades to wasteland, remain steadfast in their complicity and denial."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_187,"The holidays are around the corner and in this economy, that means Americans will either stretch budgets as best they can, go into debt or go without.Bidenomics, the name President Joe Biden embraced for his plan to “restore the American Dream,” has proven to do anything but that.Reports on how the economy is doing on a macro level vary. Some wonder if we are currently in a recession, others say it’s coming, and still others posit we just missed one.Inflation is lower than it was two years ago, but it’s still higher than it was even in 2020, when it was just at 1.2%. It rose to 3.7 then fell back to 3.2% in October. Mortgage interest rates are still high and credit card debt is too.The average balance is now $6,000, higher than it’s been in a decade suggesting people are still struggling to make ends meet.Even if prices are going up slower than before or inflation has decreased over all, people are still experiencing increases on top of increases. The compound effect of this has people reeling.In October, liberal economist Paul Krugman tweeted joyously that inflation was over based on a chart which excluded essential items people need like food, energy, shelter, and used cars. The backlash online was swift and fierce.Sure of course, the economy is great, according to Biden and some economists, if you don’t have to buy or finance anything. According to a recent AP-NORC poll, about one third of respondents think that Biden is doing a good job on the economy.While some numbers show steady economic growth and low unemployment, the cost of necessities is still high, making everyday Americans doubt Biden’s speeches celebrating Bidenomics. Grocery prices especially, an obvious essential to well-being, have increased 11% from 2021 to 2022.Supply chain issues have an impact, too. While growth and low unemployment are typically how we define a good overall economy, Biden can’t convince people that it’s good because their own bank account balance reveals an entirely different situation.All this raises the question: If this is Biden’s economic plan to help people achieve the American Dream — where a 6.25 pound package of chicken breasts is $18 at Walmart — what would constitute a nightmare?Inflation isn’t necessarily Biden’s fault, even though he’s taken credit for reducing it. In fact, at least some of what we’re seeing now is possibly a trickle-down effect from former President Donald Trump’s COVID-era stimulus checks. But Biden has absolutely throttled energy resources by refusing to complete the Keystone XL pipeline and trying to block new oil and gas production on federal lands, among other things. This has resulted in increased costs at the pump and elsewhere.But Trump’s not the president — Biden’s at the helm now, and he keeps telling Americans, whose grocery prices have soared, that his plan is working. When discussing the economy, honesty would be a great place for Biden to start, as well as more realistic ideas to reduce grocery prices, interest rates and inflation.Otherwise the kids on the naughty list aren’t the only ones who won’t be getting Christmas presents this year —- and nobody else will, either, because they can’t afford it."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_168,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In December 1966, the CBS special “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” premiered. At the time, it was “the most expensive half-hour ever put on TV” due to animation costs, music and narration.It was inspired casting that Boris Karloff, star of 1931’s “Frankenstein,” would provide the voice of the Grinch. The artists may have also sketched features of Karloff’s face onto the Grinch’s face. There seems to be an odd resemblance.What would the Grinch sound like? Boris Karloff, of course. A 1966 TV reviewer wrote: “Who is to doubt that a man so akin to the metaphysical world as Karloff knows what a Grinch’s voice is like?”To the delight of fans, Karloff will forever be the face and voice of Dr. Frankenstein’s monster and Dr. Seuss’s Grinch. Karloff considered himself “lucky” that he had these roles.For the last 57 years, the Grinch has continued to steal Christmas, to the delight of young and old. The Grinch returns for Christmas 2023!“How the Grinch Stole Christmas” tells the story of a mean green character with a tiny heart who does not want Christmas to arrive. He dresses as Santa and with a sled driven by his dog, steals Christmas presents and decorations from the Whos in Whoville. On Christmas morning, the Grinch marvels as the Whos still celebrate Christmas. It is a heart-changing experience for the Grinch. The program is a joyful annual holiday experience for all.At the 1967 Grammy Awards, the Song and Record of the Year was “Up, Up, and Away” by the Fifth Dimension. The album of the year was “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” by The Beatles. The Grammy for Best Recording for Children went to 78-year-old Boris Karloff for narrating “Dr. Seuss: How The Grinch Stole Christmas.” Karloff died in 1969.Karloff’s daughter Sara told me that the Grammy was the only major award that her father won. I suspect that if kids and adult fans were allowed to vote in the Emmys or Academy Awards, they likely would have given both awards to Boris Karloff.Karloff’s 1931 performance in “Frankenstein” made him internationally famous for the rest of his life.Halloween would not be the same without a screening of the film. Kids and adults wearing Frankenstein masks for Halloween is an American tradition. Karloff is with us every October.In December, Karloff will also be with us as the Grinch. Christmas cards with images of the Grinch are popular with kids and adults. Sara Karloff said she has written “Merry Ginchmas” on innumerable holiday cards for kids and other lovers of her father’s Grammy Award-winning voice work. This Christmas will be no different, she said.On a historical note, “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” was a 1966 CBS TV Special. It was initially broadcast on Sunday, Dec. 18 at 7 p.m. Eastern. It pre-empted the popular audience favorite “Lassie.” The Grinch had fierce competition from ABC’s hourlong episode of underwater drama “Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.” That evening’s episode, “The Brand of the Beast,” had a werewolf onboard the submarine.James Patterson is an American author. He wrote this for InsideSources.com.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
leoweekly_2023_74,"As welook out into the American abyss — Black bodies and Black trauma are still paraded in the streets and across our screens. Little seems to change in the system that creates these scenarios, and we’re grappling, yet again, with the “How much more?” question. How much more can we take? How many more Black bodies will be sacrificed to this system? The number has to be finite, but when will we see the final integer tick across our television screens or pop up as a tweet on our phones?As I started to plan this issue of LEO, knowing that it was falling on the first day of Black History Month, I wanted to consider what it meant to have a Black future here in Louisville. So often, daily survival keeps us from considering what we might become in the future. When I say we, I am speaking directly to Black people as a Black woman. What will we be in the future? Wewillbe in the future. That is a certainty.Artist Alisha B. Wormsley declared in her 2017 billboard in Pittsburgh’s now-gentrified East Liberty neighborhood, “There are Black people in the future.” The statement seems obvious. Of course, Black people are part of the future. This statement, however, gave agency and space to Black people to claim their part in the future. It spoke to the need for Black folks to look ahead and make the future be there for us, not just that we need to exist for the future. We will be a part of it and it better make room for us because we’re coming.Wormsley follows in the footsteps of many Afrofuturists, including Sun Ra, who our new film writer, Tracy Heightchew, discusses in her piece about “Space is the Place,” playing Thursday, Feb 2, free at the Speed Cinema. The film gives Sun Ra center stage to offer Black people a chance at a world that leaves “Earth” and all of its dangers behind.This issue examines Black future through our stories, our music and our art. Since this is also the LEO Winter A&E issue, it created the perfect chance to put these pieces together.There are two features in this issue, one a story from the Louisville Story Program’s newest book, “If You Write Me a Letter, Send It Here” due in April, which gives people from the Russell neighborhood a chance to tell their stories amidst the current shifts in their landscape; and the other an Interview-Magazine-style piece where Kiana Benhoff of Kiana and the Sun Kings interviews another musical artist, Cyr Wilson of Live Action about the musical divide in Louisville. It takes two artists, seemingly from different musical genres, and allows them the space to talk about challenges and opportunities.The issue is unique in that much of it is centered clearly around a theme. It is a more curated LEO than many previous, but I think the cohesion in the stories, the opportunity for a Black future to be imagined or experienced, is something quite special. If space and money were never an issue, I could have added so much more to this book, and so many more voices. With that said, I’m quite proud of the work and the stories. This is another issue that you can spend time with over a favorite hot mug, glass of wine, or whatever you drink (or don’t while reading your LEO.The stories will show up online, but the paper is something unique this time. Our cover art by Alexis ‘Stix’ Brown is a window into what could be and a nod to what has been. As she says in her interview, “My work challenges its viewers to emerge with something tangible for our elders to be proud of, a safe space for our future generations to navigate confidently, and to compliment the unwavering spirit of our brave Ancestors.”This issue creates a space, something tangible for our elders to be proud of, something of a safe space, I hope that in some small way, this issue complements the spirit of those who came before me, who gave me their shoulders to stand on, and who still support the work that happens at LEO in creating room for voices that should be heard.•*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_13,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Last month, Donald Trump (yet again said he wanted to ditch Obamacare, saying costs are “out of control.” President Joe Biden, in response, has vowed to protect and expand the law that’s extended health coverage to millions of Americans. While Trump and his fellow Republicans don’t have much credibility on this issue, it would be a mistake to dismiss his comments out of hand. Obamacare is, by design, too expensive for many Americans.The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, made sweeping changes to the U.S. health-care system. It included measures to prevent insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and enabled children to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26. It also required most health plans to include free preventive care and expanded Medicaid coverage to include more low-income families.From the start, though, Obamacare has been divisive. Many Americans worried that increased government involvement in the health-insurance market would inflate costs. Republicans spent years trying to repeal the law and succeeded in eliminating the parts they found most objectionable, including the provision to penalize people who don’t have insurance (the so-called individual mandate . Some of those measures were designed to keep prices in check.Efforts to scrap the ACA stalled in 2017 and the law remains largely intact. It has been a success by many measures: More than 40 million Americans have coverage under the program and enrollment has reached record highs. The national uninsured rate has fallen to 7.7%, from 16% when the law passed. But critics who warned about the costs of an ambitious government agenda weren’t entirely wrong.Consider one of the law’s most popular provisions: protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Obamacare established a rule that prevents insurers from setting premiums based on health status, among other factors. The measure ushered millions of sick Americans into the insurance pool who were previously denied coverage or stuck with exorbitant premiums. But, absent the individual mandate, doing so also raised costs for the young and healthy. As a result, many decided to forgo insurance until they got sick; insurers lost money and exited the market; and costs soared even higher.Today, 80% of enrollees on the individual market are subsidized — to the tune of $20 billion a year — largely thanks to the extension of COVID-era enhancements that expire in 2025. Without such assistance, premiums become prohibitively high for individuals of moderate means.With so many Americans now dependent on subsidies, renewing them would be prudent. However, lawmakers should use the looming deadline as an opportunity to explore more sustainable reforms that bring premiums down, such as incentives for people to enroll before they get sick. Going forward, Biden’s administration should also acknowledge that industry-wide consolidation has driven prices higher and worsened patient outcomes. Updating the regulatory tools that assess market concentration, some of which use decades-old data, would encourage competition and keep prices in check.Trump’s right to recognize that the Affordable Care Act isn’t all that affordable.But given its overwhelming benefits, lawmakers would be wise to use the next year to reform rather than replace it. Americans deserve a health care system that lives up to its name.— Bloomberg Opinion"
suffolknewsherald_2023_150,"Published 6:39 pm Friday, January 20, 2023ByStaff ReportsStanding partially bent over with his arms extended to each side and his elbows forming near 90-degree angles, Coach T demonstrated to his players the perfect stance to defend their chance at a rebound.“That’s how you box out if you want that basketball when it comes out the hoop,” he instructed. The team of 8- and 9-year-olds giggled at one another as they rehearsed the stance thrusting their elbows out just as he had shown them. When Coach T lobbied a ball towards the goal, they exclaimed, “box out, box out” in anticipation of the ball falling through the hoop. They seemed to follow his example pretty well. He smiled as he wondered whether they will remember this when it really matters…during the game. It’s one thing to box out in practice but it’s harder when you are defending against a real opponent.Right now these little league players only see that defensive stance as a tactic needed to get a rebound in the game of basketball. Yet it also applies when you are defending your life particularly as it relates to striving for something that you want. Every player must learn how to “box out well” and to do it in every defensive position. Boxing out is a strategy.We create many strategies at the start of the new year. On New Year’s Day, I sat on the floor of my family room with my three children and we all created our vision boards. Admittedly, I was proud of myself for doing this with them. I learned so much about their goals and visions.My 9-year-old, who is a member of the basketball league with Suffolk Parks and Recreation, wants his team to go to the season’s playoffs this year. We talked about what it takes for him to achieve that goal. Recently, when he came home from school limping because he had not made wise choices on the playground, my husband who happens to be his basketball coach, had to have a talk with him about how injuries affect his goal. My son instantly learned that making wise choices is a means of setting boundaries.Just as much as we are goal setting at the beginning of the year, we should also be boundary setting. Every goal has to have a boundary. For example, if you desire to lose weight in the new year, then perhaps you no longer eat dinner after 7 p.m. or you don’t allow yourself to have certain sugary snacks anymore. If you want to save money to buy a car, then you have boundaries each month for how much you spend recreationally. If you want to have more time for self-care, you have certain blocked hours on your calendar that you don’t allow anyone to interrupt. Goals are not achieved just because we are working towards them. Just like in basketball when we have to take a defensive stance against the opponent to keep him/her from getting what we want, we have to have a defensive stance in life. You have to box out the opponent. The opponent is anything or anyone who stands in the way of you reaching that goal.Boxing out is not easy in basketball because it is an uncomfortable stance. It is not easy in life either. Everything seems to infringe upon the territory that you set. For that reason, God gave us elbows. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not sideline-coaching you into a foul on the basketball court. Yet, every good basketball player knows how to use those elbows correctly to box out his opponent. I’m simply saying you got to know what to use to keep your boundaries up and your defenses tight.I was praying the other day asking God to remove some things in my life. In response, God revealed to me this message about boundaries. For many of us, we are dealing with things we don’t want to deal with simply because we have not set boundaries. Setting boundaries is our box out defense stance to keep the opposing influences and counterproductive activity at bay so that we can achieve success. James 1:25 in the Message Bible says, “But whoever catches a glimpse of the revealed counsel of God—the free life!—even out of the corner of his eye, and sticks with it, is no distracted scatterbrain but a man or woman of action. That person will find delight and affirmation in the action.” Sticking with the law of God creates good boundaries. Through the law, we are empowered to practice discipline which will produce results.Coach T taught the young basketball team how to “box out” during practice. Yet, they won’t experience the reward of the rebound if they don’t implement what they learned during the basketball game. Likewise, we won’t experience a fulfilled life and walk uniquely in our purpose if we don’t implement what we read in the Word of God during our everyday life. Keeping your boundaries means you’re not distracted. You are being true to the vision God has given you. So elbows up in the Year 2023! We have some goals to achieve.QuaWanna N.

The more important question is what we get in return.According to at least one group’s analysis, Virginians get good bang for their buck.WalletHub, which advises consumers on their credit scores, says Virginia, which ranks among the top half of states in total tax burden, has the seventh best taxpayer ROI nationally. ROI, for those unfamiliar with business lingo, stands for return on investment.Some 73% of American taxpayers think the government doesn’t use their taxes wisely, so WalletHub’s analysis is useful.The company used 29 metrics to compare the quality and efficiency of state-government services across five categories – education, health, safety, economy, and infrastructure and pollution – taking into account the drastically different rates at which citizens are taxed by their locality and state. Virginia ranks fourth in education, 20th in health, eighth in safety, second in economy and eighth in infrastructure and pollution. And, impressively, No. 1 in the nation in overall quality of governmental services.If you wish your government services were better, just be thankful you don’t live in North Carolina (32nd or West Virginia (46th , to name a couple of neighboring states. California, whose residents have the country’s highest tax burden, ranks dead last in taxpayer ROI and 35th in quality of government services.We’re especially proud of Virginia’s education ranking, which is based on factors such as quality of the public university system, quality of K-12 schools, high school graduation rate, availability and affordability of community colleges and prekindergarten funding.The commonwealth should aspire to improve its health ranking, which is based on availability of hospital beds, average life expectancy at birth, infant mortality rate and average health insurance premium, among other factors.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

eugeneweekly_2023_25,"We ve got issues. Current and past Lane County commissioners request voters do not sign the recall petitions against the state representative State Rep. Paul Holvey has been unfairly targeted for a recall election. His detractors want voters within his House District 8 to force a costly special election. As current and former Lane County commissioners, we celebrate his accomplishments and leadership in Salem and the role he’s played in getting many of our region’s priorities passed over the past two decades. Holvey was appointed to his House seat in 2004 by the Lane County Board of Commissioners. He has consistently had an open door for local community members and has engaged in numerous policy initiatives to benefit our area. As co-chair of the Capital Construction Committee of Joint Ways and Means he holds sway on key investments for our community. Those dollars translate into fixtures on the environment and jobs in our communities. Lane County has Holvey to thank for the following projects: Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. • Territorial Highway improvements, including widening along the stretch where Jane Higdon lost her life while bicycling. Holvey’s committee passed the Jobs and Transportation Act, which provided Lane County with both title to Territorial Highway and $35 million to improve it. • Hwy 126 improvements from Crow Road to Florence. Long a dangerous stretch of highway, Holvey has been a tireless advocate and ensured the Department of Transportation undertake both planning and subsequent construction to implement a host of safety improvements. • Holvey leveraged his role in Salem to ensure the region impacted by the Holiday Farm Fire has received a fair share of recovery dollars. Between the 2021 and 2022 sessions, his actions ensured some $50 million of state resources made their way upriver. In keeping with his decades of support for everyday working people in Lane County and across Oregon, Holvey is the chair of the House Business and Labor Committee, and strongly supported advancing a bill to ensure that projects built with public dollars prioritize local employers hiring local employees and providing them with full family health insurance.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_44,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°For centuries, the quest for new elements was a driving force in many scientific disciplines. Understanding an atom’s structure and the development of nuclear science allowed scientists to accomplish the old goal of alchemists – turning one element into another.Many scientists believe that gold and other heavy metals were deposited on Earth’s surface after asteroids collided with the planet.The same thing could have happened with these superheavy elements, but super mass dense heavy elements sink into ground and are eliminated from near the Earth’s surface by the subduction of tectonic plates. However, while researchers might not find superheavy elements on Earth’s surface, they could still be in asteroids like the ones that might have brought them to this planet.Scientists have estimated that some asteroids have mass densities greater than that of osmium, the densest element found on Earth.The largest of these objects is asteroid 33, which is nicknamed Polyhymnia.Polyhymnia isn’t the only dense asteroid out there. In fact, there’s a whole class of superheavy objects, including asteroids, which could contain these superheavy elements. Some time ago, I introduced the name Compact Ultradense Objects, or CUDOs, for this class.In a study published in October 2023 in the European Physical Journal Plus, my team suggested some of the CUDOs orbiting in the solar system might still contain some of these dense, heavy elements in their cores. Their surfaces would have accumulated normal matter over time and would appear normal to a distant observer.So how are these heavy elements produced? Some extreme astronomical events, like double star mergers could be hot and dense enough to produce stable superheavy elements.Some of the superheavy material could then remain on board asteroids created in these events. They could stay packed in these asteroids, which orbit the solar system for billions of years.The Eurpoean Space Agency’s Gaia mission aims to create the largest, most precise three-dimensional map of everything in the sky. Researchers could use these extremely precise results to study the motion of asteroids and figure out which ones might have an unusually large density.Space missions are being conducted to collect material from the surfaces of asteroids and analyze them back on Earth. Just this month, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission brought back a sample. Though the sample analysis is just getting started, there is a very small chance it could harbor dust containing superheavy elements accumulated over billions of years.NASA’s Psyche mission, which launched in October 2023, will fly to and sample a metal-rich asteroid with a greater chance of harboring superheavy elements. More asteroid missions like this will help scientists better understand the properties of asteroids orbiting in the solar system.Learning more about asteroids and exploring potential sources of superheavy elements will help scientists continue the century-spanning quest to characterize the matter that makes up the universe and better understand how objects in the solar system formed.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2023_23,"The Holidaysare here again, and let’s think about this Editor’s Note as housekeeping. LEO, like so many news outlets, has been through many changes in the last year, so we’ll try to fill you in as best we can.Firstly, this issue is our second to last for the year. We’ll have one more in December and then we’ll take a nice long break for the holidays and from the print. We will still be sharing content online, but our print schedule will resume in February and, in that similar time frame, we should be able to share a new web experience for LEO readers. We know our website has issues. It hasn’t really been upgraded for a long time so we think a new look and ease of use will certainly be welcomed.LEO thrives on our interactions with our readers, and just as we want to upgrade the user experience, we’d love to continue to hear from you about things that are on your mind or your reactions to things we write. Most issues have a section called Soapbox, which is your chance to showcase your opinions and thoughts. We occasionally accept guest submissions, but typically, the sources have some proven connection to the subject matter. Just because you had a bad day at a supermarket or feel that someone at your local DMV is mistreating you, that isn’t really the type of guest submissions we’re seeking. We like when people take the time to respond to current events in an intelligent way, even if it’s a bit “saucy,” and we really like when our readers share an experience with something they’ve read about in LEO (see Rose Boyle’s “Let Me In, Margaret” letter .We’re always looking for interesting pitches and stories that can expand who and what we know about our city and its people. Hopefully in the new year, we will be able to build on our team to bring back more regular pieces of news and in-depth features. As you’ve probably noticed, LEO operates on a skeleton crew, and while we try to cover or find ways to connect to as much local news as possible, it’s damn near impossible to do all that we’d like with the small team we have.Be patient with us, because there have been a lot of new changes this past year and there are some still to come. We hope the newer changes create new bonds and strengthen those connections LEO has made over the years. We recognize how much LEO does mean for Louisville and are doing the best to keep the paper moving forward so that it continues to be the brilliant gift that John Yarmuth gave our city.This is our Holiday Shopping and Gift Guide. If LEO could make one wild wish, it would be that LEO’s readers and community understand how precious it is to live in a city with an alt-weekly, and that you continue to support us with your advertising, ticket purchases, letters to the editor, jokes online, and even your witty disagreements. We view our work as a duty to our community and we hope that the new year brings a renewal in the work that we can do to keep Louisville informed, entertained, and sometimes, thoroughly freaked out.“I don’t know where I’m going from here, but I promise I won’t bore you.” —David Bowie• ( ."
suffolknewsherald_2023_39,"Published 3:53 pm Tuesday, May 23, 2023ByJen JaquaThe year 1961 starts off in an explosion of news and turmoil. On Jan. 4, an explosion of a nuclear reactor killed three people in Idaho Falls.While the weather was cold and icy, it paled in comparison to the icyness of the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Cold War was heating up fast. In January 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower broke diplomatic relations with Cuba, and all Americans were advised to evacuate.Other headlines from the first months of 1961 included “U.S. Newsmen in Cuba held,” “Boston flier said killed, Havana hit” and “Soviets test nuclear weapons.” At the bottom of the front page, in a 15-part series over as many days, the News-Herald ran “Knowing What to do Increases Your Chances You Can Survive Atomic Attack.” It detailed how to build a “poor man’s fallout shelter,” the danger of the radiation, how long to stay in the shelter in case of attack, essentials needed in the shelter, what different bombs do, how to survive them and how to cope with and clean up in the aftermath.While nuclear war was on everyone’s mind, their eyes were turned to the sky or the closest television set.On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard Jr. was the first American launched into space. The United States had reached a historic moment in the space race. Shepard radioed from the weightless void of space that he could see, through his periscope, the entire East Coast of the United States.In August, scientists announced it may be a decade or more before permanent bases are established on the moon. On Feb. 20, 1962, John Glenn became the first human to orbit earth.“Shortly after launch, Glenn reported a tremendous view of the earth stretching back to Cape Canaveral. He also said he saw his booster rocket falling away after it had unleashed him on his orbital path. Over the Canary Islands, he said that the horizon appeared to be a brilliant blue. “I am very comfortable,” he said. “I have a wonderful view of Africa. I have the Canaries in view through the window but they are partly obscured by clouds.’’ He said his view of Africa also was partly blocked by heavy clouds, which gradually thinned out as he passed out over the Indian Ocean. Glenn had a good view of the southern United States as he passed over on completion of his first orbit. President Kennedy was reported as very pleased that the flight was going off successfully.Post offices around the country had packages delivered prior to Feb. 20 marked do not open. Once Glenn was picked up from the Atlantic following his flight and deemed safe, a message went out to all post offices to open the packages and sell the commemorative stamps.The same week as the history-making space orbit, a new comic was advertised on the front page: “The Flintstones.” The notice said, “Even in the Space Age, everyone will find a chuckle in the Stone Age satire.”In May 1962, a new medical procedure that could be performed by ordinary people was unveiled. The procedure, known now as Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, or CPR, was at the time called “Reviving a heart beat” and said to have been developed to restore heartbeat and breathing to a person whose heart has stopped. Diagrams included on the page illustrated the procedure. The short article explained “direct breathing mouth to nose” and proper external heart massage can prevent damage to the brain and other organs if done within four minutes of the heart stopping.In other medical news, Dr. Sue Eggleston Woodward became the first female doctor who was a native Suffolkian. There had been female doctors practicing in Suffolk, and there had been Suffolkian women who became doctors and went elsewhere, but Dr. Woodward was the first Suffolk-raised and practicing female doctor.In May 1961, some workmen in the Great Dismal Swamp discovered a safe, stolen 16 years prior from a service station, along the Jericho Ditch. The safe was turned over to the sheriff’s department and then returned to Spivey’s Texaco station on U.S. 13. Delmer Spivey found old account statements in the remains of the safe dating back to 1932. Despite their long immersion in water, the bills were legible.In November of 1962, a break in the tension finally came, as 40 Soviet rockets stationed in Cuba were dismantled and removed, immediately followed by the end of the Cuba blockade.Jen Jaquais the creative director for the Suffolk News-Herald.

suffolknewsherald_2023_107,"Published 6:23 pm Friday, March 3, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardThe recent abrupt closure of Bennett’s Creek Farm Market — a decision that owners Jim and Martha Shirley say is final — is sad not just for the customers of the family-owned store but for North Suffolk as a whole.Since it was built in 1963, the store has provided residents of the area — then mostly farmland, now a bustling suburb — with an option for fresh produce, meats, eggs and milk, with a hot case, deli, fine wines and seafood added at various points along the way.We might be a little biased, but the store’s meat department beat the socks off the national supermarket chains that sprang up around it over the past three decades.But, in the end, the customer base isn’t what it once was, the cost of doing business has soared and, after a quarter-century in the business, the Shirleys are ready to move on. To their credit, they squelched false hopes about a possible reopening, clarifying in a Friday news release that the social media campaign, including a GoFundMe account, was unauthorized.“I have turned down multiple offers from land developers because I wanted to continue this nostalgic, local market in an area where a piece of the past is so important,” Jim Shirley said in the news release. “Over 25 years I have invested a great deal of money into the business including renovations, upgrades and increased payroll. Unfortunately, I have been unsuccessful in finding a tenant with the commitment and funds to keep the market going as it is.“As a businessman, I had to make a hard decision. It is never easy or pleasant to close a business. I know all too well how it affects employees and the community. It is the very reason I have put this off for so many years.”We respect the Shirleys’ decision and wish them good health and prosperity in retirement.For its regular customers and loyal employees, the absence of Bennett’s Creek Farm Market will leave a gaping hole in the community.Compared to other store closures, this one feels personal — probably because, unlike the chain grocery stores, Bennett’s Creek customers were made to feel like part of the family. Walking through its doors and seeing the smiling faces of the staff was as welcoming as a warm embrace.The store was a throwback to a bygone era. There were no self-checkout lanes or online orders with curbside pickup. Doing business face to face was part of the market’s charm and homey feel.It is truly difficult to imagine Bridge Road without its heartbeat.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_38,"Published 3:54 pm Tuesday, May 23, 2023ByStaff ReportsBy Tom MastaglioGuest columnistMonday May 29 is the official date in 2023 to honor those who have died in wars defending the United States.Memorial Day originated in 1865 as Decoration Day to memorialize the 600,000 men and women who died during the Civil War. In 1882, the name was changed to Memorial Day.Following World War I the focus of holiday was expanded to include casualties from that war. The date designated to recognize the sacrifice of our soldiers was May 31, but in 1971, due to the desire of Americans for three-day weekends, it was changed to the last Monday in May.Memorial Day is often misunderstood by many. Some confuse its purpose with Veterans Day as recognition for all who served and serve. As a young man, I recall that some of my peers thought it a day to memorialize any family member who passed and decorated their graves on or near that date.Let me emphasize that the purpose of Memorial Day is to recognize those who died serving their country in the Armed Forces in any war or conflict. It is intended as a time to step back and consider those whom one may know personally who died in combat and/or to honor in general all who passed as a result of wartime injuries.So I ask each reader to consider who you will memorialize this coming Monday, is there a family member or a friend who gave their life for this country. It might be an extended family member, uncle, aunt, cousins or grandparents going back multiple generations. You may have not have known them personally, but know of them from other family members.If you lost a loved one personally or close friend, take the time on Monday, outside of other get-togethers and parties, to spend a moment memorializing them in your own way. If there are graves you can visit, do so, hopefully a local veteran’s organization will have flagged their grave, but if not please place one on it and/or some flowers.These brave citizens gave all for their country. This is the least we can do to honor and memorialize them.If you want to join in public ceremonies, Smithfield holds its Memorial Day service at 11 a.m. at the Isle of Wight Veterans Memorial downtown and Suffolk at 10 a.m. at the Albert G. Horton Jr Veterans Cemetery, a most solemn setting. However you can, please remember to memorialize our brave men and women next Monday.Tom Mastaglio is the media and publicity coordinator for American Legion Post 49, Smithfield.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

suffolknewsherald_2023_106,"Published 6:24 pm Friday, March 3, 2023ByStaff ReportsZoning Applications recommended by the Planning Commission Staff are not adhering to the City of Suffolk Unified Development Ordinance and are being recommended and approved contrary to law.The purpose and intent of UDO include implementing the policies of the Comprehensive Plan to ensure that public facilities required to support zoning changes and new development, such as central water, stormwater management, streets, schools, parks/open spaces and trails, meet or exceed the level of service standards established by the Comprehensive Plan concurrent to the impact of the development. Proper application of the UDO ensures that no rezonings, site plans or subdivision plats are approved if the action would cause a reduction in the level of service for any public facilities below the adopted level of service. Advancement of Capacity for Public Facilities needed to avoid a deterioration in the adopted levels of service shall not be accepted by the city unless the proposed public facility is a “planned” capital improvement included within the Capital Improvements Program of the applicable service provider.In considering an application, the planning department director must study the demand on existing public facilities in the impact areas, including existing and approved developments, committed and pipeline development and the availability of existing capacity to accommodate the proposed development. If capacity is not currently available, the director must consider information for planned capacity and the year in which such planned capacity is projected to be available. If the director determines that any public facility will not be available concurrent with the impacts of the proposed residential development at the adopted level of service based upon existing public facilities, the UDO states that the director shall make a negative determination in the staff report.Upon receipt of the Planning Commission recommendation, City Council may: Make a positive determination, a negative determination, or a positive determination subject to one or more of the following conditions:In September 2022, the Planning Commission Staff recommended Rezoning Application RZN2022-007, Ellis Farm on Manning Road, for approval even though two impacted schools currently exceed capacity with forecasts for higher enrollment numbers over the next seven years.Kilby Shores and Forest Glen are overcrowded and use mobile classrooms for overflow.This approval is contrary to the UDO becauseKilby Shores is at 104% utilization. With the projected growth through 2024 and additional students projected to be generated from the Ellis Farm development, the utilization will increase by 10.5% to 114.5%. In addition, the capacity does not consider the recent approvals for other developments in the pipeline.Although the staff report contained information on school impact, it lacked complete information justifying the demand on existing public facilities in the impact areas from existing and approved development to include committed and pipeline development; the availability of existing capacity to accommodate the proposed development; and whether existing capacity is available or indicating increased planned capacity and the year in which such planned capacity is projected to be available as required under §31-601. Instead, the staff report merely suggested that the developer had proffered funds to accommodate the generated students in existing facilities which are clearly over capacity.Considering the requirements under §31-601, the staff report was incomplete. The Planning Commission staff should not have recommended the Ellis Farm application for approval due to not meeting the threshold for available capacity concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development nor having the school improvements or replacements as Planned Capital Improvements within the next five years. To adhere to the UDO, City Council must deny this and similar applications that do not meet the criteria set forth by §31-601, whether or not the Planning Commission staff report recommends approval.Violations of the UDO can lead to penalties and criminal sanctions. For example, according to §31-310, except as otherwise provided in the UDO, “any development or use initiated after the adoption of this ordinance, or maintained in violation of the ordinance, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance is prohibited and shall be referred to herein as an “unlawful” development or use.” The UDO further states that “v iolating, causing, or permitting the violation of, or otherwise disregarding any of the provisions of this Ordinance by any person, firm or corporation, whether as principal, agent, owner, lessee, employee or other similar position, shall be unlawful…” and is subject to criminal sanctions.I respectfully ask that the city follow the UDO in its decision-making.

eugeneweekly_2023_24,"We ve got issues. Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year, tomorrow, next year, next decade and next century — our work at the Eugene Water & Electric Board (EWEB never stops, even as the environment we operate in grows increasingly dynamic. As Oregon’s largest public utility, EWEB serves approximately 200,000 people in Eugene and parts of the McKenzie Valley. Our services — delivering drinking water and electricity — are becoming more precious and are essential to our community’s vitality. The most immediate challenge facing EWEB is effectively planning and operating in a turbulent environment, including a changing climate, new technology, developing energy markets, political and regulatory flux, natural and human threats, and evolving diverse community opinions and expectations. Guiding EWEB is a set of core values that reflect those we serve, including safety, reliability, affordability, environmental responsibility, equity and transparency. These values are all inclusive and perpetual, and we are responsible for navigating the tensions and tradeoffs between them. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Using our values as a guide, EWEB has spent the last 18 months forecasting Eugene’s electricity needs 20 years into the future and using modeling analysis software to assess various combinations — or portfolios — of electricity sources that would best meet those needs at the best price. This is our Integrated Resource Planning (IRP process, which is an analysis tool used to inform near-term decisions and actions. Recognizing that every energy resource has tradeoffs, we put some guardrails on the IRP process. We required every energy portfolio created by the model to keep rates low, always maintain electricity reliability, even during peak consumption, and be 95 percent carbon-free by 2030. The IRP analysis results yielded several key insights. EWEB should continue to have hydropower as the foundation of our portfolio. EWEB will need to modify or develop customer programs to save energy and manage when electricity is consumed to mitigate peak demand. And, under modest growth conditions, EWEB will need to supplement our hydropower base with new intermittent renewable resources (wind farms and new utility-scale storage (batteries . The analytical results also showed that if demand for electricity rises more dramatically, EWEB will need zero-carbon, on-demand, “dispatchable” electricity sources. EWEB’s model identified biomass co-generation and small modular nuclear reactors as the lowest-cost options available under some conditions during the 20-year planning horizon. Other technologies may emerge in the future that offer similar capabilities, potentially with better costs, both financial and environmental. We’ll evaluate and consider them when they do. EWEB is not alone in the need for resources with these operating characteristics. A 2022 regional study by the reliability coordinator for much of the Western U.S. indicated a need for “other emerging clean and flexible energy resource technologies that do not produce emissions” and for other “clean resource types with performance characteristics similar to that of gas-fired generation resources.” With the modeling results published, EWEB is now moving to specific actions that we can accomplish in the next two to three years. None of the actions involve procuring new generation resources. Instead, we will launch additional studies, continue regional dialogues, monitor emerging electricity markets and technologies, and refine our decision-making framework for when we do need to acquire additional electricity resources. EWEB will continue to negotiate a new contract with the Bonneville Power Administration, which provides about 80 percent of our energy. We will determine how much potential there is to conserve energy in the community, and how much it will cost EWEB to enhance our programs and incentivize customers to conserve more. We will assess the potential to shift electricity demand during the day to reduce peak energy use, because peak energy is more expensive to procure and typically comes with higher carbon emissions. And, lastly, we will adapt our assumptions and forecasts to prepare for our 2025 IRP — because EWEB will conduct an IRP analysis every two years to adapt to shifting conditions and better information. The recent IRP process has informed EWEB about the issues and options based on today’s assumptions. Not everyone will be pleased with the outcomes, which reveal tradeoffs and challenges that we must overcome in the coming years. But ultimately, quantitative and qualitative information — along with our values and judgment, not the software — will determine the solutions, actions and outcomes we pursue. The goal is to reassemble an electric generation portfolio based on all our values — safety, reliability, affordability, environmental responsibility, equity and transparency. Thank you for your feedback and support!"

Sorry, but we neither trust nor like people who think it’s OK for terrorists to decapitate Israeli babies, rape teenage girls at a music festival, murder families in their homes and shoot sobbing children hiding in bushes after missiles introduced their energetic arrival, all the better to get even.”The manager stared angrily at the slowly exiting if fiery-faced graduate for a moment, adding that this person’s idea of “truth” seemed little more than a self-rewarding, ideological, cultural, morally empty, uneducated malevolence including antisemitism afflicting Jews through the ages. While these brave, tradition-blessed, self-disciplined people are small in number, they have done enormous good for the world and are still at it, this imagined manager said by way of expressing my opinions for me through a writing trick.Some sympathizers of the Hamas celebrants have weirdly suggested their savage deeds were more a matter of responsibility than vicious desire. By way of common sense, video viewers may have noticed the enjoyment as these thugs went about their handiwork, acts of uncivilized, inhumane cruelty that their defenders just might imitate.The way this torture festival in the Middle East has been so widely welcomed in American colleges across the country and among certain other segments of the American population is itself tortuous. It speaks to our decadence, the wasting away of so much of what has been exceptional about us. Consider how higher education has grown greedy beyond the capacity of millions to pay tuition, that it has been downplaying the crucial humanities, and mostly junked the once-required study of the miracle of Western civilization.In America today, the two-parent family is withering away with atrocious consequences for the children. Public schools are well behind educational achievements in other developed countries in the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic, although, wait, they are helping to instruct students on gender decisions. Common sense is hiding out.Crime is less and less being punished while more and more ruining lives. In California, looting has been legalized with the consequence of closing down businesses, depriving citizens of sources of everyday needs and eliminating jobs. Local governments don’t know how to govern. Scads of intellectuals don’t think merit really matters, just skin color. In the middle of all of this and far more, we have had these anti-Israel protesters all over the country, including at colleges often with special courses emphasizing diversity, equity and inclusion as the modern way of “reform.” Jews don’t seem to be diverse enough for inclusion although Palestinians definitely are. Five Middle East nations attacked Israel in 1948 right after the ancient entity was officially named a new nation. An Arab leader turned down an extraordinarily generous conciliation offered by Israel but did not go as far in contemptibility as a Hamas official, Fathi Hamad, who said every Jew everywhere in the world should be “slaughtered and killed.”To me, the nonchalance among too many Americans about such ambitions and their blaming Israelis for what neighbors want to do to them is solid evidence of American decadence on the march.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2023_22,"Inthe middle of sorting through my ideas for this editor’s note, I learned that Paul Reubens died. For those who don’t know, he was Pee-wee Herman, amongst all the other amazing characters and roles he played.Reuben’s Pee-wee Herman was a significant marker in my childhood and how I developed my penchant for offbeat comedy and oddball people. He was weird, a little awkward, and those things all worked for him. Mostly. There was certainly a period in the early ‘90s where his weirdness was his enemy but that blip in his history (which shall not be named was the result, on some level, of the overreach of ‘80s conservatism. Reubens kept his private life private, especially after that incident, so when he passed, it felt like a lightning bolt. To me, anyway, because, as the proud owner of a Pee-wee Doll and all the films, he’s one of my favorites and to know he’s left the world feels like a little less pure joy is left in it.In his final message which he held private until his death, he said, “I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you.”With this being LEO’s Arts and Entertainment issue, how could I write a note and not give a nod to one of the delightful weirdos who made it possible for a world just strange enough for a LEO to exist? Reubens gave such a gift to the world and it’s my hope that every time we pull together an issue of LEO, we do something that is out of the norm, unexpected and perhaps, a little uncomfortable.I think we have, especially as we invite new columnists and guests to our pages to offer opinions and perspectives that might ruffle a few dirty bird feathers.This issue is focused on Arts and Entertainment with listings for events, gallery shows, film, books, and of course, a chance to meet some local artists. However, what makes LEO what it is involves looking towards the offbeat and unusual.As the world of entertainment and theater shifts just a bit in the absence of Reubens, I hope that America, in particular, begins to understand the value of our cultural assets and invests heavily in those — as much as we do in tech or other industries.To create, artists need support and space to bloom. This shouldn’t be something given to just a privileged few people whose families can afford for them to create art. It should be an occupation and career path like any other that can afford a living wage. For that to happen, Americans need to see the value in the people who sing us to sleep, tell our stories, and illustrate our lives even in the most abstract of ways. The document of the human condition is priceless.Several of the Great Meadows grantees highlighted in this issue made mention of the need for more funding and more opportunity and those things are keys to unlocking the difference between someone who dabbles in the arts and a person who can live as an artist. It’s time to respect that craft and the hustle.•*** ."

A 17-year-old bootlegger was caught in the act of bottling the contraband in the “shadows of the evening” and apprehended with a bottle of the liquid in his jacket ready for sale.Suffolk was a growing city in 1928, as seen in a story entitled “Variety of business before City Council sessions here.” According to this article, Council was to consider annexation of part of Lakeview Heights. The annexation was brought to the attention of the City Council by residents of Lakeview, who desired that a strip near the Norfolk and Western Railroad and adjacent to Lake Kilby be taken into the city. No action was taken at this meeting, however.It would seem downtown business was also booming, as Suffolk was about to get a new theater. A piece that ran in May 1928 described the theater plans in detail under the headline “New plant to give Suffolk fine theater.” The property known as the Fotosho building, located on North Main Street, was transferred to the Suffolk Amusement Corp. for a period of 20 years at a total rental of $124,500. The name of the new theater was to be changed from the Fotosho, by which it had been known since it was used for the present purpose, to that of “Roxy.”Suffolk agriculture has always been important; however, it wasn’t all peanuts and cotton. In a late spring article, the price of peas and cabbages is discussed. The story, entitled “Heavy Shipments are leaving the city daily,” discussed the “fine quality” of the produce but the low price due to drop in price in other states.On July 7, 1928, the first machine-sliced, machine-wrapped loaf of bread was sold in Chillicothe, Missouri, using Otto Frederick Rohwedder’s technology. Thereafter, the idiom “best thing since sliced bread” came into use for various nifty, useful and practical inventions.In Suffolk on July 7, the first cotton bloom was presented. W.H. Watkins of the Ferry Point section of Isle of Wight County brought the first cotton bloom of the season to the News-Herald office and as a consequence received a year’s free subscription to the paper. Do farmers still celebrate the first cotton bloom?Later in July, St. Mary’s Catholic Church purchased the property that would become its rectory for $100 and other valuable considerations. This note of history was detailed under the headline “Catholics own their rectory.” The Rev. Father J.V. Brennan, pastor of St. Mary’s Catholic Church at the time, made the purchase.Crime also made the headlines back then. A short piece in late July entitled “Auto speeder pays the price,” notes that Police Justice S.E. Everett placed a fine of $14 upon a man, charged with speeding, when he was arraigned in police court. I wonder how fast he was going; sadly, the article didn’t mention the speed.At the bottom of that page, however, there was a nice large advertisement for a new Chrysler “75” Royal Sedan for $1,535 from the Briggs Motor Co. on West Washington Street. The sedan had many options, including a rumble seat. Another ad on the page listed a sale on corsets from McKays on Main Street. They were selling for $2.95.In October 1928, it seems the city joined the world in the detailed following of the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin hydrogen-filled rigid airship. Each day, the logs of the adventure ran on the front pages of the paper. The airship offered the first commercial transatlantic passenger flight service.In Boston, on Oct. 12, an iron lung respirator was used for the first time at a children’s hospital.A couple days later, Suffolk’s big news was a fire at Washington Square in the rear of R.R. Allen and Son hardware firm shortly after 2 a.m, according to the story entitled “Washington Square Property is visited by a disastrous fire early this morning.” Firemen had six streams on the burning building, bringing the blaze under control shortly before 4 a.m.Scanning through the front pages of 1928 shows a snapshot of a city on the edge of growth with no idea that a year later, the world would be thrown into the Great Depression.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_80,"Published 6:05 pm Tuesday, April 4, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardEaster occurs, appropriately, in the spring, when even a non-Christian can find inspiration in signs of renewal all around us.Flowers are back in bloom. Green leaves have reappeared on limbs recently bare. People have reemerged from their winter hibernation. Outdoor opportunities abound in Suffolk during the spring.For Christians, Easter Sunday continues to be a perpetual reminder of hope, that no matter how heartbreaking the moment may seem, all is never lost.On Good Friday, Jesus’ followers thought that their world had come crashing down. The charismatic figure they had followed for the past three years and in whom they had put their hopes was dead. Before their very eyes, Jesus had been mocked, tormented and crucified like a common criminal.Yet the disciples did not truly grasp what Jesus was about until Easter Sunday, when He rose from the dead. With His resurrection, they came to understand that His kingdom — and theirs — was not of this world but the next. And they came to see that out of great suffering can emerge immense joy. There could be no Easter Sunday without Good Friday.It is this juxtaposition of misery and happiness that has braced Christians to endure war, natural disaster and personal tragedy for the last two millennia.“No matter what the storm clouds bring, you can face your pain with courage and hope,” writes the inspirational author Max Lucado. “For two thousand years ago — six hours, one Friday — Christ firmly planted in bedrock three solid anchor points that we can all cling to. For the heart scarred with futility, that Friday holds purpose. For the life blackened with failure, that Friday holds forgiveness. And for the soul looking into the tunnel of death, that Friday holds deliverance.”This weekend, as we flock to churches throughout Western Tidewater to celebrate Jesus’ resurrection, let us remember those who are suffering in our community, in our state and around the world. Let us pray for a change of heart in those who are consumed with death. Let us hope that peace will replace conflict, that the proverbial swords will be turned into plowshares.As we learned on the first Easter Sunday, miracles do happen.The MLB schedule today is not one to miss. The outings include the Los Angeles Dodgers squaring off…Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_186,"President Joe Biden speaks to reporters at the American Possibilities White House Demo Day at The Showroom in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 7, 2023. (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images/TNS Iran is getting richer and increasingly dangerous during the Biden presidency. This has enabled the country to more aggressively arm its Middle East terrorist proxies who seek to destroy Israel.On Thursday, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp blustered that Israel would face more attacks like the atrocities of Oct. 7. “Just as the al-Aqsa Storm came from a place the enemy did not calculate,” he said, “they must wait for other storms that will reach them from where they do not figure out.”At the same time, an Iranian military commander has told Hamas that his country will not allow Israel to “reach its dirty goals” of defeating Hamas, The Associated Press reported recently. That certainly sounds like a threat of escalation.It’s fair to ask how much the White House’s appeasement of Iran has endangered the region and emboldened bad actors who openly admit their goal of wiping Israel off the map.According to The Washington Post, the International Monetary Fund estimates that Iran’s foreign currency reserves have jumped 50 percent in the past two years.Much of this is oil money. The Trump administration put harsh oil sanctions on Iran. President Joe Biden relaxed them once he took office, leading to an increase in exports, primarily to China. The Iranian government and the terrorists of Hamas and Hezbollah have been the beneficiaries.The Biden administration recently announced it would now “enforce oil sanctions against Iran amid the renewed conflict in the Middle East” in an effort to financially squeeze the country, Reuters reported. Fair enough, but that doesn’t undo 30 months of ignoring the problem.In fact, Iran of late has increased oil production at a rate higher than the United States, The Wall Street Journal noted last month, making the country’s primary resource even more valuable in the world market. Biden has been openly hostile to domestic energy producers in an effort to satisfy green extremists. As gasoline prices soared above $5 a gallon, he even asked our enemies — including Iran — to ramp up production rather than turn loose America’s own producers.All of this has been a boon for the mullahs in Tehran as they bankroll Israel’s enemies.In September, the Biden administration even agreed to release $6 billion in cash to Iran as part of a prisoner exchange deal. The windfall was supposed to be for “humanitarian” purposes, but money is fungible, and the move would have made it easier for Iran to fund terror. The White House wisely put a freeze on the funds shortly after the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, but the initial decision demonstrated a woeful lack of judgment.Likewise for the administration’s decision to re-issue a sanctions waiver that allows Iran access to another $10 billion generated by the nation’s electricity shipments to Iraq. Again, despite the “humanitarian” intent, the money will make it easier for Iran to arm and support terrorists. “Iran sends $700 million to Hezbollah and at least $100 million to Palestinian terrorists annually,” according to the Journal. Reuters reports that Iran sent $300 million to Hamas last year.Against this backdrop, one thing remains clear. American efforts to accommodate Iran — dating back to the Obama administration, in which Biden served as vice president — have made the world a more dangerous place.— Las Vegas Review-JournalThe Miami Dolphins have stamped their approval of coach Mike McDaniel for the long haul.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_169,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°It’s holiday season, and the Biden administration is in full Santa Claus mode. Never mind the $33 trillion national debt clock whirring upward, the White House is making liberal use of a massive green slush fund to dole out taxpayer-funded goodies to favored special interests.The comically misnamed Inflation Reduction Act contained $400 billion to be dispersed as part of President Joe Biden’s green industrial policy. That’s a fancy phrase for empowering government bureaucrats under crony capitalism to make decisions that should be left to the marketplace.Much of the cash will be funneled through the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office. There’s no shortage of outstretched hands.“The agency agreed to a $1 billion loan for Monolith, a company that promises to make hydrogen out of natural gas,” Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal reports. “Sunnova, a solar company, landed a $3 billion loan guarantee. Then there are all the real paupers. General Motors and LG scooped up $2.5 billion to build electric-vehicle battery plants. Ford landed a record $9.2 billion battery commitment. The Ford loan would be $3.3 billion larger than what the company borrowed during the Detroit meltdown of 2008-09.”There’s more. The Environmental Protection Agency also has billions in taxpayer cash to throw around. “The EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will be responsible for distributing $27 billion to nonprofit groups and the green energy technology sector by next September,” The Washington Free Beacon reports.Remember all the waste and fraud that characterized the government’s COVID response? The same risks dog the administration’s green handouts — and many observers are ringing alarm bells.The Energy Department’s inspector general, Teri L. Donaldson, testified last month before a Senate committee, “The current situation brings tremendous risk to the taxpayers,” adding that the accelerated disbursement of funds creates “a real risk of funding entities with foreign ownership or control.” In addition, Ms. Donaldson noted, “many of these projects are designed to promote innovation by financing projects not otherwise acceptable by private equity investors — projects the markets do not view as acceptable.”Supporters of green pork argue that such “investments” will pave the way for our brave new energy future. But the idea that state and federal functionaries are capable of manipulating the energy marketplace without deleterious consequences is fiction — as is the notion that the United States can meet all its energy needs over the next few decades solely with renewables.—Las Vegas Review-Journal"
leoweekly_2023_75,"I held hands with a small group of relatives in my new Vine Grove, KY., home on New Year’s Eve and asked everyone to inhale and then exhale as we crossed over to a new start amidst pain and turmoil all around. Up to that moment, all holiday plans were halted, canceled or deterred by external forces we could not control. We simply could not force the universe to comply. We had to accept that we could not attain the perfect day of tradition, celebration and/or simply a universal memory amenable to all.In the dining room, a small motley crew gathered — embattled and barely standing. We were bruised by these recent years — COVID, life, loss — and fatigued as we joined together eye-to-eye after these disruptions. Many of our loved ones were not there, and the few assembled were not the same. Each one of us was at a different point in our journeys and the only common denominator, this night, was the familial connection of blood and marriage.Some of us freaked out and isolated over the last few years.Many of us indulged, in any way possible for our own survival, with various addictions: work, substance abuse, food, exercise, etc. Some were starting lives in new homes with little ones who were just old enough to begin forming core memories.As I looked around the room, I saw disappointment and sadness, but there was also laughter at old stories not thought about in quite some time and general exhaustion with the stress of holiday expectations. The reactions were varied and moved about the room in waves.There was evidence of deterioration from age, personal sickness and separation. I called for a joining of hands and a simple statement that would speak to everyone in the room.I realize that I, truly, did not know where everyone was — spiritually — in the room, but I did not want that to stop us from creating a brief pause and acknowledgement to a greater power, a simple space to be wherever we were on our spiritual path and still feel loved and accepted with the freedom to channel our own personal beliefs into the moment, even if it was a simple exhale into silence in our chaotic gathering.We squeezed one another’s hands, inhaled on command, and let out a long exhale that sent a cacophony of emotions and thoughts out of our bodies. Everyone was welcomed to call upon their own deity or simply to send out a reflection, release, plea, wish and/or intention for a new year, and we were all battle-weary on various levels. This evening, we took our struggles, blessings and pain, and marked the moment in our minds — acknowledging this time, our first holiday in a new home, with family, after isolation.The need in the room was palpable, and these were all my people, my tribe, my story, my blood.So many experiences were present, and each one was worthy of space.My family? We are American mutts, rooted in mixed races who were thrown together by the only option to join the middle class that our poverty-stricken fathers found — the military. We are the outcome of a Mexican fruitpicker from East L.A. who married a fair-skinned coal miner’s daughter from Hopkins County. My family is a blended one, like so very many of yours are now, and we have stories to share.Join me in this small space I want to create for us, a storytelling adventure with tales from my family, as we are, sometimes barely hanging on, with multigenerational curses and blessings that have joined us together around this dinner table, in a little town built upon a small military post.Maybe, just maybe, you might see yourself or your family in my stories.I’m a first-generation college graduate who looks Mexican, like my father, raised by a blonde white woman — a woman who never fully understood why she chose her own path.Now an ex-social worker/therapist,I have worked under license and with no license. I lost my career through disability, and gained a new identity in that small death. My life bears witness. My stories will, too.I’m you, you’re me, and we’re still, even after these years of isolation and quarantine, in this together. •Keep Louisville interesting and support LEO Weekly by subscribing to our newsletterhere.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_12,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Concerns about rise in homelessnessConcerns about rise in homelessnessI am composing this message to convey my profound worry on the startling increase in homelessness in our beautiful town of Hilo. We must all pay quick attention to and take action in response to this growing situation.Hawaii’s distinctive and beautiful scenery frequently conceals the harsh reality that an increasing number of people live in unstable homes. The increase in homelessness has an effect on our communities as a whole, in addition to endangering the lives and well-being of people who experience it.People from many walks of life, including families and veterans, are having difficulty finding assistance and a place to live due to the high cost of living in paradise.While there are many contributing elements to this crisis, some of the more obvious ones include the high cost of living, the scarcity of reasonably priced housing, and the dearth of comprehensive assistance for addiction and mental health.We cannot continue to allow this to continue as a community. We must push for policies that will provide affordable housing, mental health care, addiction treatment and other helpful programs that can assist individuals in getting back on their feet.Furthermore, it’s imperative that we cultivate empathy in our communities. Myths and stereotypes about the homeless only serve to exacerbate the issue. Rather, let us collaborate to create a nurturing atmosphere where individuals who are facing homelessness can obtain the assistance and materials they require.Every person who lives on these islands should uphold the aloha spirit that makes Hawaii unique. Together, let’s identify problems, back sensible legislation and build a better future for our state.Addressing the increase in homelessness in Hawaii and working toward a more equitable society is our kuleana, or obligation.K. BoteilhoHiloArmy training areaposes a fire hazardMahalo for the Nov. 5 Tribune-Herald article about fire hazards on the Big Island. But I haven’t seen any fire assessment or in-depth look at having a live-fire bombing and shelling military base in the center of our island, which is a very windy and dry area. How about an article on that?How many fires were started by Pohakuloa Training Area in the last 25 years?Just one year before the Lahaina fire, a fire that started in Pohakuloa burned 20,000 acres, including land outside the base. Instead of calling it the Pohakuloa fire, it was called the Leilani fire. Deception or what?And given all the toxins used at Pohakuloa, including depleted uranium, what toxins are blowing in the wind and smoke off Pohakuloa?Do any officials know and care? Hawaii Dr. Lorrin Pang, who spent and 24 years in the Army Medical Corps, said Pohakuloa should be ringed 360 degrees for a full year with proper air filters to know what’s coming off the base.In 2008, after depleted uranium was confirmed to have been used at PTA, the County Council passed Resolution 639-08 by a vote of 8-1. It called for eight actions, including comprehensiveindependenttesting and monitoring.To date, none of the eight actions called for in that resolution have been done.

suffolknewsherald_2023_147,"Published 6:00 pm Tuesday, January 24, 2023ByJen JaquaThe year 1929 got underway with rewards offered to come up with a plan to repeal the 18th Amendment. A prize of $25,000 for the best plan to bring (legal alcohol back into the country was the leading headline on Jan. 2, 1929.William Randolph Hearst, owner of multiple newspapers, issued the challenge via his newspapers. The call was for “a more liberal and more American measure,” with the article going on to explain the impossibility of enforcing Prohibition. Despite this interesting measure to find a solution, prohibition and the raids and arrests of bootleggers would populate the news pages for another four years.On Feb. 27, 1929, the newspaper announced a reunion resulting from a letter from a woman in England searching for her family. As a 6-year-old child, Carrie Rountree had been taken back to England by her adopted mother. She grew up knowing she had older siblings, but not knowing their names. According to the story, Carrie sent a letter to theNews-Heraldthat was then published, and within hours of the paper hitting the streets, calls came flooding in. Mrs. J.L. Johnson, who at the time lived on Pinner Street, was overjoyed to discover the little sister she and her siblings thought dead was alive and well in England.Newspapers were the primary source of information and communication for decades. The turn of the decade would see that idea, and many more, challenged.In 1929, the first public demonstration of color television was held, by H.E. Ives and his colleagues at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York City. The first images are a bouquet of roses and an American flag. Less than two years later, the first TV commercial appeared.Characters such as Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse and the Looney Tunes appeared for the first time. The first Academy Awards are presented in Hollywood.However, in Suffolk, the best way to stay informed continued to be the Suffolk News-Herald. During the World Series, the News-Herald set up a player board in front of the office on South Main Street, allowing citizens to gather and get the play-by-play of the World Series throughout the game.The May 10 front page announced the beginning of long-distance truck delivery of peanuts by Planters. Hauling peanuts by truck was seen as the solution to rising costs in shipment via rail car. Even as truck transportation use began, the railroad expanded. A brief story on the front page Aug. 12 detailed the plans of Norfolk and Western Railway to build two new storage tracks as well as to expand the train depot on Main Street.In the beginning of October 1929, the News-Herald launched a campaign to boost paper subscriptions. The contest allowed individuals in and around Suffolk to gather as many subscriptions as possible; more points were awarded for new subscriptions. The winner of the contest would have a chance to be a movie star. In partnership with I.P.I. Studios, the paper had movie contracts as the grand prize of the contest.In a tiny story at the very bottom of the front page on Oct. 28, 1929, a small headline read, “Stock prices tumble again in Wall Street.” The two-paragraph story details the fall of the stock prices dropping at record-breaking amounts by midday. What is now known as the great Stock Market Crash of 1929 got only minor front page headlines. The bigger news that day and the days to follow were of plane crashes, sunken boats and the celebration of Navy Day.Mid-April of 1930 brought with it a much more localized front page for theSuffolk News-Herald.Following a change in the managing editor of the paper, the front page of the News-Herald went from featuring mostly national stories to almost 100% Suffolk news. New businesses accompanied by photos of the storefront adorned the paper many days.It would seem that while the country sank into the Great Depression, the Suffolk economy was growing rapidly. Surrounding the business news were reports of marriages, deaths and announcements of local meetings.Results of the 1930 Census showed Suffolk growing in people as well as businesses. The front pages of 1930 highlighted a bright future, showing a city growing rapidly, bringing in new businesses and new industry and sending its products out worldwide. This growth and expansion continues to this day.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_96,"Published 6:58 pm Friday, March 17, 2023ByStaff ReportsNow is the hour; we are seeing a time in history where foreign nations are escaping the confinements of the federal fiat currency, known as the American paper dollar, that has deceived not only the world, but the pockets of the American people to this day; therefore, allowing only the elite class to control and regulate the access to true wealth through faith in a piece of paper that is not backed by anything.While Americans are distracted by pseudo statesmanship on all fronts, foreign nations, specifically our prime threats China and Russia, are forming economic alliances under the organization known as BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. They are putting forth agendas to drop the dollar entirely; forming new economies outside of the fiat currency and backing them with gold, which will devalue the dollar and hinder Americans wealth.It is time to push forward Virginia State House Resolution No. 557, to determine a second currency that is constitutionally sound and one, like gold, that is respected by all foreign nations.This is not a new trend by any means but better yet, an old warning that has not been heeded properly here in the commonwealth, as it has in other states across America. If we do not get ahead of this by opening up a second currency here in the states, we are in for some real trouble and hard times.This will disturb foreign trade and economic growth domestically, and the first signs of this distress will be bank closures across the nation, which will change the psychology of our own Suffolk community. The poor will starve, and crime will increase. The middle class will demand or take more power. The once wealthy class, that made their fortunes off the fiat currency, will not hold the order they once had because paper currency will not hold the same weights and measures; and it will be despised by the local population after such a collapse.The necessary thing to do would be to formulate a Virginia state currency that is economically respected by all, statewide and national, to decrease the impact of the coming federal currency crisis, while enacting one that allows it to be honestly regulated, locally, by the Virginians, and not by big bankers sitting on Wall Street.Virginia legislators must look to the other states, like Utah and Wyoming, for inspiration on procuring the wealth of their citizens and establishing safeguards for business transactions by legislating a Virginia legal tender act.This would allow gold and silver coins to be a Virginia state legal tender. Then the free market can put forth a Virginia goldback, which would be upholding the U.S. Constitution, as they should have already done so prior. Article I, Section 10 states that “No state shall…make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts.”What good does a goldback have for we the people? Well, during the time of the founders, they couldn’t construct measures of gold into a carriable fashion with respects to all levels of wealth. This is where the long dead-end history of American notes comes into play.Today we can establish gold coin notes, in reasonable measures that represent all levels of wealth. They are already being used in state business transactions in Utah, New Hampshire and Wyoming, which is what is called Goldbacks and is advertised as: “The Goldback is the world’s first physical, interchangeable, gold money, that is designed to accommodate even small transactions and to promote the use of inflation proof currency and to protect the spending power of families and individuals at any income level.”It looks like your paper dollar, can be carried like your paper dollar, and can be vaulted like the paper dollar. But it is actual gold and the federal reserve cannot tell you otherwise. The private federal reserve has notoriously devalued the wealth of this nation and dishonorably ran a ponzi scheme on all of the American citizens since its creation in 1913, which was arguably the foundation of the current economic monopolization of a currency that is unconstitutional.If Virginia doesn’t heed the warning now, the hard times will just be meticulously harder.Wouldn’t all Virginias feel better knowing that there were measures in place to guard against the federal currency collapse that is bound to transpire?Drew Varner resides in Suffolk and is a researcher and writer.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

eugeneweekly_2023_5,"We ve got issues. Here we are. We are forever changed and unrecognizable to our pre-2020 selves. We are not the same in ways that may be obvious, or in ways that are more subconscious. Collectively, I think we can agree, our society looks very different than it did just three years prior but: Are we OK? Anyone born after 1975 has been socialized and racially integrated most, if not all, of our lives. We have gone to school completely integrated. The messaging we have studied together was about the benefits of diversity. However, the small writing in this arrangement is that we would then socialize all non-white people to behave, associate and recognize themselves through a lens of whiteness. All information not only for ourselves but also for our white counterparts in the front of the class was whitewashed to ensure that segregation would remain intact. Perhaps not in proximity, but certainly in opportunity, self actualization, access and resources. Those of us living in places that were mostly white experienced that integration in a way that had such a hidden violence it became normal, expected, even comfortably predictable. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Integration was violent? The erasure of Black history and contributions, Indigenous sovereignty, and the basic knowledge of the global violence with young minds asking for clarity and affirmation is violent. That violence was taken subconsciously and noted in self worth, self esteem and internalized oppression. These issues, shackled in our minds, were carried into adulthood. Some of us survived and others — well, they are unrecognizable but familiar versions of who they were from the continued impact of it all. As violence does, you’re never the same. As the world spirals towards an unknown awakening, the privileged are expressing their fear of losing power in the most sweepingly violent ways they can: stripping the already bare social systems of any recognizable human decency for its citizens, specifically citizens of historically excluded groups. It is a choice. The same one for each of us — historically excluded and white-bodied men — a choice to face the untold and unspoken stories. For those of us who represent the global majority, the need to declare that the space we take is not by favor, but by character, by persistence, by resolve, by receiving the assignment from our ancestors and community, picking it up and leaving nothing unanswered. This character, undoubtedly measured by white-bodied people by the violence the environment has promised us. That character is not the character we speak of. Our character is connected and buoyed by our deep knowledge of self, community and familial worth. This character constantly wrestles with that opposition. To be in high proximity to whiteness, is to consistently balance precarious positions of safety and progress. Now, late 2023, we are not indebted. We are not in doubt. The balance is publicly displayed as uneven; we are seeing the lie. The choice the global majority is making is to reintroduce a truth that is not new to them, but new in an insistence to have our natural names be pronounced how they were intended, an insistence that the teachers represent my culture, an insistence that linguistic variety is represented in a robust and functional way, an insistence that the structures — the institutions — are named and held responsible for their part in this violence. The insistence that white peoples’ discomfort is not a no go, but a necessary step to liberation. This is a different courage, this is a different movement, this is a new collective truth. I’m here for it."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_190,"Less than an hour after the House Ethics Committee published their extensive report on the elected fraudster from New York, Con(gress man George Santos took to Twitter to claim that he will not be running for a second term next year. Don’t believe him. Don’t believe anything this schnook says, since everything is a lie.Only when petitions for the June primary are filed in April and Santos doesn’t submit will his absence from the ballot be real. Unless he pleads guilty by then, he’ll still be a free man, as his federal criminal trial on Long Island starts in September. But there’s a good chance he won’t be a member of Congress and we’ll have to stop calling him con(gress man.Not that Santos will resign (and give up the $174,000 government salary and medical coverage , but his disgusted colleagues perhaps will expel him, maybe as soon as they return from their Thanksgiving break. But they should not undo the 2022 election until Santos has been found guilty in a court of law or by the Ethics Committee.Despite documenting many misdeeds with his campaign funds, the committee did not render a judgment or recommendation beyond to “publicly condemn” him. There is no standard Statement of Alleged Violation that they always use to recommend punishment by the full House, which can range from being reprimanded or reproved.We know why they punted, as to not interfere with the ongoing criminal case. But the process matters greatly. Even press statements from Ethics Committee members calling for Santos’ expulsion isn’t the same thing as the bipartisan panel voting that way.We have said from last December, when it was exposed by the press (belatedly that Santos wasn’t a Jew, or a former banker or ever enrolled in college and his exploits and biography were all lies, that he should resign, but lying isn’t a crime.Soon enough prosecutors started looking and they found many crimes to charge him with. And the ethics panel also dug and published their findings. But charges aren’t guilt.If the priority is getting Santos out of Congress, then the Ethics Committee should have formally urged his expulsion. That they didn’t does make a difference. The members seeking his ouster (led by other New Yorkers have already tried twice to get the two-thirds majority and they may succeed the next time. But they need to remember that they write the laws for the nation and doing it exactly right is very important.Having Santos found guilty by the courts or the Ethics Committee should be the standard.We don’t want this guy disgracing the already disgraceful Congress any longer than he has, but there can’t be any shortcuts. The House has only ever expelled five members: three traitors from the South who took up with the Confederacy against the Union when the Civil War started in 1861 and a pair of criminals following their convictions on felony charges in federal court in 1980 and 2002.Santos is a liar and a lousy bum and is likely to be nailed for his many offenses, but it hasn’t happened yet.

eugeneweekly_2023_65,"We ve got issues. On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, Nancy Pelosi spoke to members of the Democratic caucus via video conference. She closed the meeting with these words: “Today is the Feast of Epiphany, Jan. 6, concerning the Magi, the rest of the world seeing the birth of Christ. Let us pray in any way that you do, for our country, and that today will be an epiphany for the American people as they see the difference between our respect for the oath we take versus what they the president and his allies are up to, and let us hope that they will see the light and have their own epiphany on the other side.” It was indeed a day of epiphany unlike any other our country has seen, just not the epiphany the speaker had envisioned. Instead of Magi bearing gifts, our temple of democracy was assaulted by MAGA bringing destruction and violence. On this second anniversary of that day, I ponder, how is that we have fallen so low in this country to trade the Feast of Epiphany for the pigsty of insurrection? And I wonder this, who in that righteous mob shouting to hang Mike Pence even knew the significance of Jan. 6 on Christian calendars? Does anyone besides me see the irony, given the strong evangelical support for the MAGA movement, that it was the speaker who invoked the Epiphany tradition on that morning while the president stoked lies about the election? Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Epiphany is from a Greek word meaning “revelation from above.” There were indeed many epiphanies revealed to us that day, but hardly from above, unless one is referring to the commander in chief of the Insurrection. Here are but a few of the most disturbing: The Epiphany story, however, is not about doom and destruction but light shining amidst the dark, symbolized by that star leading the Magi. This too, we saw on Jan. 6: In the original Epiphany story as told in the Gospel of Matthew, those gift-bearing Magi were warned not to report back to the king, for he wanted to destroy the child. Seen in the light of Jan. 6, 2021, that child the king would destroy is our democracy, vulnerable as a new born baby. This Epiphany I give thanks for those who follow a different star today, bearing gifts of truth, honesty and integrity. They are the Magi. Because of them, the light of democracy still shines, and darkness has not overcome it. May it so remain in 2023 and beyond."
leoweekly_2023_63,"Socialworkers are often called to the job by experiencing trauma in their own life history; I was born from trauma, so it’s my natural state.My mother was born a matriarch and was skilled in protecting those she loved, not out of choice, but necessity. I feel that this is why she slipped so comfortably into the job of mother and homemaker while my father would be off to field training or war. Parenting came naturally, as it was expected of her with every younger sibling that followed. As the siblings came one after the other, she found herself dropping out of school by the seventh grade to work with her older sister at a steam laundry. At home, she took on the task of babysitting her siblings and vigilantly protecting them from the drunken brawls and parental rage that cut verbally and physically on any given occasion. When she moved away with my father, her younger siblings were left to live through continued deterioration of the family and increasing abuse which led to the divorce of my grandparents. This was her only framework for parenting and the beginning of prolonged guilt in leaving them behind to start her own family.My father was clear about being married to the military from the start, and he was not lying. He went to Vietnam twice: 1962, when my sister was born, and 1969, when I arrived.He got to welcome both of us into the world but was not present for either birth due to military training and left for war right after saying hello. He missed the first years of both of our lives to fight, and my mother was left alone to tend to the family.My birth story is filled with trauma and joy.On a hot summer day in Fort Rucker, Alabama, my very pregnant mother was spending time under the carport of her military housing while my five-year-old sister played in the neighbor’s plastic wading pool with their son. Another mother came up the street and brought her twin boys to join them. It was the summer of 1969, and life was intense and volatile with all the societal changes of the times.The mother of the twins shared her fatigue and struggles with parenting alone as a military wife. She had twins and one of them, Ernie, was very difficult and would scream and act out daily. The resources and interventions of today were not created or implemented at the time and how to parent a difficult child alone was a daily struggle to his mother.As the ladies visited and vented about parenting with military husbands, my sister ran up to my mother in a panic. She nervously shared that Ernie was doing tricks and floating on the water. Mom looked up and saw the sweat on my sister’s upper lip that appears every time she gets anxious to this day. She knew something was wrong. Ernie’s mother, who was at the end of her parenting rope, exclaimed, “Thank God, maybe he’s dead.” At that moment, the reality of the situation hit. Unfortunately, Ernie’s twin got tired of his yelling and screaming and sat on him in the water to shut him up. As the mothers went to check on the situation, the panic ensued. Ernie had been drowned by his brother and was unresponsive.It just so happened to be lunchtime, and my father always came home to check in and eat. He arrived on this day to screaming women and chaos. His first-responder reaction kicked in immediately, and he grabbed the boy to start CPR. Just as Ernie puked up the water from his lungs, the ambulance arrived.Needless to say, my traumatized mother went into labor three hours later. My father drove her to the hospital and left her at the emergency entrance there as someone had to watch my sister. My mother delivered me alone at 4:55 pm. My father arrived later and the nurses and doctors all celebrated two lives that came into the world that day, both gifts from my father. I came into the world two weeks early and Ernie got a second chance at life.A social worker was born.•*** ."

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_9,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°(Dreamstime/TNS Target recently announced that it was closing nine store locations because of “organized retail crime.” The term, which is often used interchangeably with “organized retail theft,” is being used more and more to describe viral videos of what’s often seen as “brazen” theft taking place in retail stores like Walgreens, CVS and Target. But what does it mean exactly? And does it actually describe a real trend or is it a myth propagated by corporations and the media?As a research fellow at the Harvard Shorenstein Center, I have analyzed the organized retail theft narratives for years and worked with community-based groups to disrupt it by challenging how these news stories are leveraged for political purposes. Generally, organized retail crime refers to professional shoplifting, cargo theft, retail crime rings and other organized crime. But the lack of a clear legal definition leaves significant room for interpretation at the state and local level.At least nine states have passed legislation based on substantially different definitions. In Delaware, organized retail crime is taking “quantities that would not normally be purchased for personal use or consumption.” Meanwhile, in Alabama, the term can be applied to someone who “receives, retains or disposes of retail merchandise,” having “reasonable grounds” to believe it was stolen. Yet, research shows that none of these laws are likely to reduce crime and could disproportionately impact marginalized groups. For example, when looking at historical arrest records, it is estimated that Black people were arrested and charged with organized retail theft more than twice as often as their white peers.Articles warning of organized retail theft first began to appear around October 2020. Stories by publications like San Francisco Chronicle and later SFGate cited rampant organized retail crime as the cause of Walgreens store closures in California.Government data doesn’t show that retail theft is actually increasing. According to The Marshall Project, around 40% of law enforcement agencies (over 6,000 did not report their most recent crime data to the FBI at the time these stories started circulating. Also, police departments often do not distinguish retail theft from other kinds of robberies and larceny. And in the instance of the recent Target closures, data journalists have shown that where there is data available, in three of the locations slated for closure (in East Harlem, San Francisco, and Seattle , there were fewer reported incidents of shoplifting in and around those stores than other stores that are not slated for closure.And in January 2023, Walgreens’ Chief Financial Officer, James Kehoe, told shareholders that concerns about organized retail theft were overstated, admitting the company had over invested in private security companies and mechanisms.Everyone deserves to feel safe in their communities. Local businesses are the lifeline to communities and should be able to thrive. That’s why we need more transparency, public data and legislative solutions, such as The Combating Organized Retail Crime Act, backed by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and its House companion bill.We also need more responsible reporting practices. The fight to contain information chaos must include preventing the breakdown of context, which strips away a community’s humanity and history, and in turn, justifies continued injustices.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

eugeneweekly_2023_32,"We ve got issues. The climate crisis is here, and Eugene is already experiencing its impacts first hand. We just weathered the hottest July 4th holiday on record in Eugene, and our fire department contained a 40-acre wildfire in a city neighborhood that was burning early and hot. Eugene is a recognized leader in addressing climate change. In February, Eugene City Councilrightly and courageously voted to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels byrestricting the use of natural gas in housing that has yet to be built. Almost weekly, we read more studies on the indoor pollution caused by gas stoves. We know that buildings are our second largest contributor of greenhouse gasses, and that residential housing, in particular, is an inefficient, significant contributor to our community’s use of fossil fuels. The new ordinance would have given our city a steady reduction in fossil fuel dependence, addressed a serious health issue, reduced emissions and avoided the costs of retrofitting housing in the future. This week, the City Council acted to repeal that ordinance. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. This repeal was prompted by two external factors: 1 a court ruling that has created an uncertain legal landscape for the ordinance, and 2 on the plus side, the availability of time-sensitive federal and state incentive dollars available to make homes throughout Eugene more energy efficient. On April 12, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling in a challenge to the city of Berkeley’s ban on natural gas infrastructure in all new construction. That decision will likely impede Eugene’s local authority to regulate our fossil fuel infrastructure. In a positive contrast to the unfolding legal contest, the Biden administration and Congress approved an unprecedented federal investment in climate change mitigation through the Inflation Reduction Act. This funding is designed to help people switch to cleaner technology, offering significant cash rebates for homeowners and developers to transition buildings from polluting gas to clean electricity. Eugene’s Climate Action Plan positions us, as a city and as individuals, to benefit directly from these federal funds. The federal court ruling in the Berkeley case is on appeal, but it may go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court — a process that could take several years. We can’t wait that long. By stepping away from the fossil fuel infrastructure ordinance — and redirecting our efforts towards assisting homeowners and other property owners save energy — we can make critical progress now. We can return to addressing fossil fuel infrastructure later if Berkeley wins their case. For over a decade, this community has chosen to tackle the issue of climate change — you have demanded it of your city leadership in testimony before council, in letters, in neighborhood meetings, in gatherings convened by the faith community, by high school students, in workplaces and in elections. The prohibition of natural gas infrastructure was just one of many actions adopted by the Eugene City Council in the Climate Action Plan 2.0, and it is one of five motions approved by the council in July 2022 to advance our climate work and engage the community in solutions. This vote to repeal allows us to focus our energy and resources on these other priorities: to conduct robust community conversations with businesses to understand their energy needs and potential for conservation; and to engage the community in understanding the social equity impact of updating our housing to more efficient electric systems. Once the legal path is clear, the City Council can and should return to a consideration of restricting and prohibiting new fossil fuel infrastructure. Meanwhile, we are committed to ensuring that everyone in our community has an opportunity to take advantage of federal and state investments to improve the health and efficiency of their homes by switching to cleaner, electric appliances. We remain steadfast in our determination to thoughtfully and incrementally address the causes of climate change and to invest in solutions that meet our community’s future needs."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_128,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The straight party-line vote in Congress to impeach Joe Biden wasn’t about the president, but his wayward son, Hunter, who is facing a slew of federal criminal counts that he cheated on his taxes, as well as gun charges. The recovering drug addict and alcoholic is in a lot of trouble with Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss and could end up in prison for years. And it’s causing his dad major heartache and great political problems.If Hunter, not Joe, was serving in the Oval Office during his lawbreaking, we would be supporting his impeachment, as a sitting president cannot be criminally charged and must be removed from office first. And Hunter has done a lot of bad stuff, as the prosecutors allege.But, and but matters a great deal here, Hunter is not the president and the president hasn’t been credibly accused of anything. Nada. Zilch. Goose egg.The House Republicans have certainly tried finding something that Joe has done wrong, having three separate committees, Ways and Means, Judiciary and Oversight, spending all of 2023 looking high and low for Joe’s offenses.Kevin McCarthy, who began the year as the new GOP speaker of the House, now ends his congressional career as members depart Washington for their break until after New Year’s. To appease his right-wing nuts, urged on by their leader, Donald Trump, McCarthy announced a Joe Biden impeachment inquiry in September. It still didn’t save McCarthy, as the kooks then toppled him in October.The new speaker, Mike Johnson, hoping to stave off the crazies, has now made it more formal with the vote: “Directing certain committees to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach Joseph Biden, President of the United States of America, and for other purposes.”Gee, what are those “other purposes?”Hunter, who was subpoenaed for a closed door hearing, instead showed up on Capitol Hill to announce that he wanted an open hearing. That’s not really up to him and the angry Republicans say they will bring contempt charges against him, adding to his legal troubles and lawyers’ bills. But, again, it has nothing to do with Joe Biden.The indictment Hunter is facing is for tax offenses that all happened years ago, before his dad was president. So, even if Joe was in on it, (which he wasn’t it is not impeachable.Says the Constitution, impeachment is for officeholders who commit “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”One wild theory that even the Republicans haven’t floated is that Joe did something improper when was a senator between 1973 and 2009 or during the time he was vice president, from 2009 to 2017. But that would be impeaching him as a former officeholder (senator and veep , which Republicans objected to when Trump was impeached and tried in 2021. Trump was impeached while still in office and tried in the Senate after he left.Impeaching Biden for something that happened six years ago or earlier is probably too outlandish for this gang.

leoweekly_2023_34,"Dear Oracle,My partner and I both work for a public university. Or, we did, until this week when we were told that Admin had decided to fire about 90% of the adjuncts, us included. We will be out of jobs and health insurance by the end of December. We have no idea what to do. Help?-I hate surprisesCards: Three of Cups (rev , The High Priestess (rev. , The Hermit (rev. , Nine of Pentacles.Dear Surprise,I am so sorry for that the rug got pulled out from under you, and so many others, in the middle of the semester. That’s exceptionally cruel and while it’s not uncommon in academia, it’s a fucking tragedy.The Nine of Pentacles, the card of material well-being, is the only one right-side up, making it the most pressing, so the first thing you’re going to do is figure out your finances. Pull everything together and figure out what you have, if you’ll be getting severance or unemployment, if you need/want to move, and how to cover the basics. The “good news” is the healthcare marketplace is open, so you can insurance for January.With The Three of Cups, it’s also time to lean on friends and colleagues and anyone you’ve gotten drunk with a conference or chatted with on a panel. The good friends can help you out emotionally (or give you a couch to crash on or whatever while the network-friends might help with job leads.But, before you get to that step, you and your partner need to ask yourselves: what do I want?The meat of this answer are two Major Arcana, The High Priestess and The Hermit, both of which involve a lot of deep searching. The High Priestess in not only a card of the unconscious but of secret desires. These can be a secret that we even keep from ourselves. So, in this time of transition, when nothing is certain, ask yourself: if you could do anything, what would it be?Is it to go back to teaching? To pivot to an adjacent field? Or to do something completely different? At this stage, you’re just spit balling. But honestly let yourself explore the idea. Is there some job that rings out like a bell? Good.Now, with The Hermit, you’ll consider what it would mean to find a path forward towards that life. It could take time — you might need to go back to school for another three years or start cranking out screenplays, or develop a business plan and apply for loans. You might need to get day jobs that will float you while you work towards this one (unless you can luckily start your dream job in January .Talk to your partner about your wants and their wants. What do these paths look like? Can they exist in the same place? At the same time? What would that future look like? Of course, this conversation is SEVERAL steps down the road. Focus on finances now, and once you know you have a roof over your head somewhere, dive deep into your soul.Best of luck my darlings.Dear Oracle,I’m thinking about breaking up with my therapist. She’s said some shit that felt way out of line and I don’t know if I trust her anymore. What do the cards say?-Pissed off PatientCards: Ace of Swords, The High Priestess, The Hanged Man (rev. , TemperanceDear POP,While I often advocate for therapy in the column, I will admit: some therapists are terrible at their jobs. They can be actively harmful and if you think this therapist is doing damage, especially if there is a pattern, stop seeing her. The cards are moot.Now, if your therapeutic relationship has been pretty good up until this point, I think a pause might be necessary. The Ace of Swords can be very black-or-white thinking, which could translate to feeling condemned if you’re therapist didn’t 100% agree with you. The High Priestess, like I mentioned above, it a card of the Unconscious and in Jungian psychoanalysis, it’s where the shadow lives. The shadow is a place where we stuff feelings we don’t want to experience — things we have been shamed for, things we’re afraid of, thoughts we don’t want to think and desires we’re scared to admit to. There are all sorts of things in the shadow — good and bad — but it’s a tender spot. If someone pushes on it before we’re ready to talk about it, it’s like they’re sticking their finger into an open wound: it hurts hell and we hate them for it.With The Hanged Man, it feels like she might have misunderstood something that was far more fundamental than whatever specific thing she was talking about. She may have stuck her finger in a wound that has been open and oozing for years without realizing it. With that black and white thinking, it might tempting to see your only options as “quit” or “finger in the wound” but those aren’t the only options on the table. The Hanged Man does encourage a pause, a moment to stop and think. It might be true that your therapist had good intentionsandsaid something shitty. Both can true.Temperance also discourages black-and-white thinking and encourages us to hold possibly conflicting truths at the same time. No relationship is all good or all bad all the time. Complexities exist and have to be acknowledged if we want to restore balance.If you haven’t already, I encourage you to talk to your therapist and tell her exactly what upset you and your reaction to it. Together, you can address her hurtful actions and, if you feel like you can trust her, what may have triggered such a strong reaction. Sometimes a fight like this with a therapist can open the door to some deeper healing.But, again, if you don’t feel safe with her, don’t go down the road with her. Find someone new.I hope the conversation goes well, my dear.*** ."

Efforts to reverse those changes legislatively have failed in a divided Richmond, so the party, led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, is urging its supporters to take full advantage of early voting for the critical fall elections that will determine control of the General Assembly.Youngkin, in partnership with the Republican Party of Virginia, the Republican State Leadership Committee, the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus and the House Republican Campaign Committee, last week announced a campaign called “Secure Your Vote Virginia.”“Our data-driven effort will encourage our target audiences to vote absentee by mail or early in-person,” Youngkin said in a news release.If you’re a Republican or one the party has identified as a “swing voter,” you might have already received a piece in the mail or been targeted by a digital ad promoting the initiative. The party seems to be sparing no expense getting out the message.Urging early voting strikes us as hypocritical for a party that has blamed states’ expansion of that practice during COVID for Republican losses nationally since then, but it’s unquestionably smart politics.Democrats have long worked hard to maximize the numbers of votes cast before Election Day, a historical advantage acknowledged by Youngkin in his news release.“We can’t go into Election Day down thousands of votes, so I’m thrilled to have such strong partners coming alongside us in this effort,” he said. “We fundamentally believe Secure Your Vote Virginia is how, together, we can win in 2023 and beyond.”Democrats, of course, aren’t going to cede the early vote advantage to their rivals.Raw politics aside, we’re glad to see both parties encouraging voters to have a voice. Our local, state and federal governments are stronger when more people are involved in picking elected leaders, then holding them accountable.Whether early in person or by mail, or at the polls on Election Day, choose the method that works best for you and cast your ballot this fall.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Dig a little deeper, and long-standing inequities in health outcomes and access to care within our Hawaii Island community become apparent. The COVID pandemic, which pushed our health care system and our community to the limit, exposed and exacerbated these issues.We are impacted every day by the depth of the health care system disconnects on Hawaii Island — starting with shortages of providers, lack of patient access and barriers to workforce recruitment and retention. Dig a little deeper, and long-standing inequities in health outcomes and access to care within our Hawaii Island community become apparent. The COVID pandemic, which pushed our health care system and our community to the limit, exposed and exacerbated these issues.When federal funding to address minority health disparities became available in 2021, Community First Hawaii collaborated with UH-Hilo and the Hawaii County Research and Development Department. Kuleana Health was created and became the vehicle to implement the grant and distribute funds to community-based health organizations across Hawaii Island. Through the COVID pandemic and beyond, Kuleana Health has catalyzed conversations and initiatives to support the people of Hawaii Island to be healthy and thriving through making it all of our kuleana to care for our own health and the health of our community.One of the root causes of health disparities and inequities is health literacy. Even under the best of circumstances, we know that health care providers can only treat the patients who come to see them and know how to ask for the help they need. Likewise, patients can only get quality care if the providers they seek out can understand not only their symptoms, but also their personal situations and cultural context. Personal health literacy and organizational health literacy, then, are key to making the best use of the limited health resources we have in our community.From 2021 to 2023, we endeavored to answer the question, “How does our community become empowered to take charge of their health?” Through Kuleana Health, we were able to reach those hardest hit by COVID and most at-risk for adverse health outcomes, including Filipinos, Hispanics, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders and rural populations, and learned that we need to meet people where they are at — geographically and culturally. Over the two-year grant period, Kuleana Health and our partners engaged in 360 community outreach events, translated critical health materials into seven languages, and directly reached over 36,000 members of our community.We learned that it was important to provide community members a voice to direct and provide feedback to providers, and to offer providers training to develop the skills they needed to effectively work with community members. On the surface, health literacy may look like understanding the risks of diabetes or kidney disease or why it’s important to go to your annual checkup, but it reaches much deeper into the fabric of our community. The health of our community depends on how well we can understand, communicate with, and ultimately care for each other — at the doctor’s office, at home, and in communal spaces.We are deeply grateful to our partners in government, education and the health sector who participated in Kuleana Health and who are still deeply invested and engaged in the health of our community. Moving forward, it is essential that we continue promoting cultural fluency in health care as well as offering health literacy resources in accessible ways so that each of us may take responsibility for our own health and the well-being of others.Randy Kurohara is executive director of Community First Hawaii, a nonprofit serving as a convener and catalyst for solutions to improve health and access to health care.

suffolknewsherald_2023_184,"Published 6:53 pm Tuesday, September 26, 2023ByJen JaquaThe world was in a state of change at the beginning of 1991.American forces stormed into the Persian Gulf region and broke the forces of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein. The dictator had claimed the small nation of Kuwait for his country. The battle took about a month’s time.On Christmas Day, the Russian flag replaced that of the familiar sickle and hammer above the Kremlin in Moscow.Meanwhile in Suffolk, the news of the early ’90s was perhaps less life-changing, though many in Huntersville and Hollywood may disagree. InJanuary 1991, a $256,000 Indoor Plumbing Program Grant from the Virginia Housing Partnership Fund shed light on a number of residents in Huntersville and Hollywood whose homes had inadequateor no indoor plumbing systems. The Indoor Plumbing Program targeted households using pit privies and failing septic systems. A survey taken by the Department of Community Development showed that 798, or 5%, of the houses in Suffolk were without indoor plumbing.At the beginning of summer, a couple of police officers opened a side business selling hot dogs. Law Dogs were the special variety of hot dogs sold by Officers D.M. Livingston and C.A. Hines. The officers advertise their products as “all bark, no bite.” It seems that while the two officers worked the streets they often discussed where they could establish a hot dog stand in the city. The Law Dog stand was located at the Municipal Building.While the people of Suffolk enjoyed hot dogs, the following year, stale pastries were used to attract another native Suffolk resident. In October of 1992, wildlife researchers began trapping bears In the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge as part of a three-year taxonomic study of black bears in the southeastern United States. They only captured two bears for studies in the Great Dismal, because the animals apparently did not care for stale pastries. Refuge Manager Lloyd Culp said that of the 16 subspecies of black bears found in North America, three are found in the southeast, including the area of the Great Dismal Swamp.In April of 1993, in the wake of the siege at Waco Texas, cults were a part of household discussion. Several seminars were held with different groups to discuss the cults. One such was documented in late April. Members of the Law Enforcement Explorer Scout Post No. 124 recently attended a unique seminar that both shocked and educated them about the dangers of becoming involved in cults. The seminar was prompted by the actions of David Koresh and the “Branch Davidians,” the religious sect in Waco, Texas that held law enforcement at bay for nearly two months before a fire broke out in the compound, killing 82 cult members.Officer Bremer explained that Suffolk is one of the few Hampton Roads jurisdictions where police worked a Satanic cult. During 1991, Officer Bremer investigated a case involving animal sacrifices and grave tampering when a young man broke into a 57-year-old grave and cut a finger from the body of the woman buried there. Officer Bremer found the missing finger at the young man’s home along with some other evidence, including a small coffin containing a plastic skeleton.Graves weren’t the only thing getting robbed. That summer, thieves took everything including the kitchen sink. Suffolk Police Detective J.A. Coleman was seeking help from the public in identifying the thieves who were removing plumbing fixtures, carpets, doors and other Items from vacated homes in the Lake Kennedy area of the city.As the city prepared for the holiday season in 1993, Andy Damiani, president of the Downtown Suffolk Association, announced that members of that organization, businesses, were being asked to play Santa Claus. The city would soon be preparing to decorate for Christmas. Damiani noted that just as sure as the holidays roll around each year, the decorations have been hung, but without much glee In the past few years. That’s because some of the decorations are in desperate need of repair. “Some of the decorations that go up year after year are as old as Santa Claus himself,” said Damiani, a former mayor and city councilman of this city.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

Who has the right to tell someone they must die? Any candidate expressing this position can never win a general election. The other side will play this clip on television until you see it in your sleep.That no government entity should tell a landowner what they can do with their property, including zoning regulations. That sounds great, until your neighbor decides to build a toxic waste dump, explosives testing range or 1,188 acre solar farm like the Sadlers have.That government should control fuel prices and prices of the fertilizer and other chemicals farmers must use. The heavy lifting is getting a bill passed to do this ,but getting it amended later to include other things, not so hard. Government could end up controlling everything.He compares himself with Gov.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_153,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In 2015, the world’s governments declared a collective ambition: to limit the rise in global temperatures to just 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since then, two things have become clear. First, the costs of exceeding that threshold are greater than believed eight years ago. Second, the goal looks increasingly difficult to reach. Even if governments enact all the climate policies they’ve so far announced — an optimistic assumption — warming this century is on track to exceed 2C and might run as high as 2.9C. As 70,000 politicians, officials and interested parties gather in Dubai for COP28 — two weeks of talks to review what’s been done and still needs to be done — this failure to align policies with promises should remain front of mind. BloombergNEF is watching 10 areas where progress in Dubai can be measured against identifiable targets. As the meeting began, the expected score across all these initiatives was 3.9 out of 10. Likely progress on the overarching objective — to get global carbon emissions in sync with the 1.5C ambition by 2030 — was a pitiful 1 out of 10.Yes, there’s been progress. Numerous companies — including 50 oil and gas producers — have announced pledges to restrict methane emissions, for instance. The US says it now aims to slash such pollution by 80% by 2038. Bloomberg Philanthropies estimates that such efforts could reduce emissions equivalent to 10 gigatons of carbon dioxide. A narrower agreement to triple renewable-energy capacity by 2030 also looks possible.Governments are likewise inching forward on their financial commitments. Developed countries promised in 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 to help poorer countries pay for carbon abatement. Although that promise wasn’t kept, estimates suggest that the pledge was honored in 2022. At last year’s conference, governments celebrated a plan to create a fund to help poorer countries cope with climate change. As the Dubai meeting kicked off, the outlines of a facility to be hosted by the World Bank were announced. So far, the sums proposed are trivial (the Biden administration said it would work with Congress to find $17.5 million , but it’s a start.What matters now is not more minutely discussed goals, commitments and pledges, but action. It’s encouraging that, for the first time, officials at this year’s conference will weigh the findings of a formal “global stocktake” on lack of progress. That ought to stifle any desire to say “so far, so good.”One further conclusion to draw from this process is that the world can’t rely on grand global promises alone to address climate change. Pragmatic action wherever possible is vital. Individuals, companies and subnational levels of government also need to get engaged. In Dubai, the COP28 presidency and Bloomberg Philanthropies co-hosted the first Local Climate Action Summit, bringing together city leaders from around the world and underlining the role that they can play in rising to the challenge. (Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, parent company of Bloomberg News, is the UN secretary-general’s special envoy for climate ambition and solutions. Such endeavors can’t make up for the failure of national governments to effectively meet the threat of climate change. But they’re an essential part of the fight. The opportunity to avoid irreversible damage is slipping away. Now more than ever, the world needs action instead of talk.—Bloomberg Opinion/TNS"
suffolknewsherald_2023_242,"Published 5:18 pm Friday, July 14, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldAn obscure, but important, anniversary occurs this weekend: the one-year mark since the debut of 988, a nationwide mental health crisis helpline.It’s not there quite yet, but the hope is that it will become as recognizable as 911 for Americans during an era of unprecedented levels of mental illness in this country.We credit the good people at Harbor Point Behavioral Health Center in Portsmouth for reminding us of the anniversary.The number connects callers with the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline . Congress designated 988 in 2020, part of a massive investment in crisis centers such as Harbor Point. Gov. Glenn Youngkin has since made treatment of mental illness a priority in Virginia, acknowledging its impact on people and families, as well as its toll on law enforcement, which has become the de facto front line in a battle that is more societal and medical than criminal.988 is confidential, free and available 24/7/365, connecting those experiencing a mental health, substance use or suicidal crisis with trained crisis counselors. Access is available through every landline, cellphone and voice-over-internet device in the United States, and call/text services are also available in Spanish, along with interpretation services in more than 150 languages, Harbor Point reports.Since the launch of 988 in 2022, data show an increase in overall calls, texts and chats – all while answer rates are significantly improving. More people are getting connected to care (and connected sooner than ever before. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA , 98% of people who contact 988 are helped by a trained crisis counselor, resources are shared and community connections made (without the involvement of 911 during the call/text/chat. Some 9,360 people call 988 on an average day.Harbor Point reports that about 1% of people who contact 988 agree to have their crisis counselor call 911 because of serious risk to life. In fewer than 1% of 988 calls, the crisis counselor must call 911 without consent because of serious risk to life.“If someone is experiencing an emotional crisis or thoughts of suicide, call 988 or seek help at a licensed behavioral health facility,” Harbor Point CEO Freddie Anderson Jr. implored. “As a behavioral health care provider right here in Hampton Roads, our team … is dedicated to supporting children and adolescents in a manner that promotes hope, resiliency, connectedness and recovery.”On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_28,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°One of the things that makes the United States Senate what some call “the world’s greatest deliberative body” is a rule structure that ensures even members of the minority party have a voice.That is generally to the good — unless one of those voices is ideologically obsessed with one topic to the point of holding the country hostage over it. That’s what Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville has been doing for months now, by blocking hundreds of senior military promotions in protest of the Pentagon’s abortion access policy.But there were promising signs last week that that dam is near the breaking point, with several of Tuberville’s frustrated fellow Republicans publicly demanding that he end it for the sake of military readiness. Some Democrats are now floating the idea of a temporary rule change that would effectively remove Tuberville’s power to block the promotions.For passage, it would require a handful of Republicans to sign on. If they do, that would not only solve the dangerous problem at hand, but would demonstrate to the nation that, when it comes to national security, something resembling bipartisanship is still possible in Washington.Because the senior military promotions in question number more than 350, it’s not feasible for the Senate to debate and vote upon them one by one, especially because there is virtually no opposition from either party to any of them.So such rounds of promotion are generally passed all at once, by what is called unanimous consent. Simply put, they all win passage automatically, unless some senator objects.For nine months now, Tuberville has been using that objection power to block unanimous consent of the promotions — not for any particular concerns about the military officials themselves, but over the unrelated issue of the Pentagon’s abortion access policy.Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturn last year of Roe v. Wade, numerous red states have outlawed abortion within their borders. This presents a dilemma for military personnel, who don’t always have a choice as to where they are stationed. A female soldier posted in, say, Missouri, where abortion has been outlawed, would be effectively denied the same biological rights as soldiers stationed next door in Illinois, where abortion remains legal.The Pentagon has addressed that dilemma with a new policy that gives female soldiers leaves of absence and transportation reimbursement if they need to travel out of the state where they are stationed in order to legally obtain abortion services.Tuberville argues that this amounts to illegal government funding of abortion. We would argue that travel reimbursement isn’t abortion funding per se, and that the Pentagon’s policy merely ensures that all women in the military have access to the same level of health care. The issue is certainly debatable — but Tuberville’s strategy of hobbling the military in a time of global strife isn’t the way to debate it.“No matter whether you believe it or not, Senator Tuberville, this is doing great damage to our military,” South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham — no liberal slouch — said in a floor speech last week. “If this gets to be normal, God help the military, because every one of us could find some reason to object to policy.”The cooler heads in his party have an obligation to help Democrats break this dam.— St. Louis Post-DispatchA former Waiakea High School basketball coach and onetime University of Hawaii at Manoa hoops standout is facing two criminal charges for allegedly pocketing funds intended to finance hotel arrangements for a basketball team trip.KAILUA-KONA — After a seven-year hiatus, Ke Kula ‘O ‘Ehunuikaimalino girls volleyball is back in business.The Miami Dolphins have stamped their approval of coach Mike McDaniel for the long haul.HONOLULU — Gov.

philinquirer_2023_8,"Taking bold action to fight the root causes of climate change is central to protecting health, especially for vulnerable populations. This past July was thehottest monthever recorded. While Philadelphia sweltered under typical summer temperatures, record-breaking heat was documented near the southern border.Phoenixhad the hottest period recorded in a U.S. city.Austin, Texas, saw 11 consecutive days over 105 degrees Fahrenheit. These extremes felt distant from the Philadelphia hospital where we work, but the impact of this unfolding climate crisis would come right to ourdoorstep. A young patient arrived in July, only a toddler. She was admitted for dehydration, a common issue in our pediatric hospital each summer. One of us, the son of Salvadoran immigrants, gathered their information in Spanish. In conversation, it became clear that this small patient embodied some of the largest challenges facing our health-care system. Her family’s arrival in Philadelphia was the end of an overland journey that had started in South America. Brutal heat had been their traveling companion, and like many migrants with limited resources, they were dangerously exposed to its impacts. We provided the child with lifesaving intravenous rehydration, but these challenges extend well beyond one patient. What could we do to protect others from the forces that had brought this patient to our hospital, thousands of miles from home? Climate change has been identified by theWorld Health Organizationand numerous healthpublicationsas today’s single biggest threat to human health. Its hazards are many, from searingheat wavesto widespreadmalnutrition— especially dangerous for children — due to drought and floods. These disasters aredrivers of displacementand forced migration. And displacement leads to additionalhealthconcerns, both physical and mental, for people who have lost their support networks. From Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, an estimated70,000 peoplewill travel to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to attendCOP28, the annual United Nations climate meeting. In an acknowledgment of theunavoidable linksbetween climate change and human health, this year’s meeting will center afull day’s discussionson these issues for the first time. It is essential that global leaders honor this recognition by committing to a rapid transition away from the fossil fuels that are polluting our air and water while destabilizing our atmosphere and oceans. Taking bold action to fight the root causes of climate change is central to protecting health, especially within vulnerable populations. For individuals and families who are already on the cusp of forced migration, however, immediate action is needed. Nations that have greater financial resources — and greater responsibility for climate disruption through a history of burning fossil fuels — must lead efforts to stabilize existing immigration systems and protect migrant health. In an example from 2007 heralded as “environmental migration,” Spain established a bilateral agreement with Colombia to facilitate the temporary migration of those displaced by natural disasters. While this effort was discontinued after Spain’s economic crisis in the early 2010s, it represented anovel approachto the victims of extreme weather events and should be expanded as part of multinational plans for climate adaptation. Equally important will be the strengthening of COP27’sbreakthrough agreementfor a “loss and damage fund,” which directed financial support from wealthier countries toward building climate-resilient infrastructure and institutions in less affluent nations. There is a drafted agreement of support for such an endowment at this year’s gathering, and it is imperative that the final version boosts commitments andcloses the gapsin the first. Investment will be an essential part of any effort to ensure futures free from traumatic displacement for those living on the front lines of the climate crisis. While many health consequences of human-driven climate change are already being felt by those — like our young patient and her family — with greater exposure to extreme heat,dwindling water supplies, and other threats, this is not a reason to concede to fatalism. In the past, human dedication and innovation have led to innumerable breakthroughs that were previouslyunimaginable, and the scope and dangers of today’s climate crisis demand a commensurate response. Otherwise, countless families will be forced to experience the risk and heartbreak of leaving a home in search of a safe, secure future. As we look forward to COP28, we ask everyone who shares our hope for a livable planet to join us in asking the world’s leaders to understand the current stakes — and the possibilities.

eugeneweekly_2023_49,"We ve got issues. I was exercising in my basement, watching CNN, on Sept. 11, 2001, as two hijacked planes destroyed the World Trade Center. This initiated my learning journey about public health. I was then working in California as the emergency management coordinator for the county’s largest medical center. In the subsequent weeks, the markedly underfunded and neglected county public health department was called upon to ramp up quickly. One challenge after another was given to this small group of dedicated professionals. Monies flowed in from the feds over the following five years, so every health care agency became more able to meet these and other challenges (wildfire smoke, the annual flu assault, etc. . I left for Africa in 2006,and my public health education was continued in terms of clean water, sanitation (or lack thereof , poverty, etc. Moving to Eugene in 2009, I worked part time as an RN at White Bird Medical Clinic for the next 11 years. There I encountered occasional challenges with mental health access, etc.; but I was confident that the work we had done after 9/11 had rendered our nation’s public health infrastructure in a much better place after decades of neglect. With the outbreak of COVID-19 in March of 2020, I began volunteering at the Lane County Public Health Department, first on the phone lines and contact tracing, and later I joined hundreds of volunteers in the vaccination efforts. I was appointed to the Public Health Advisory Committee and this reintroduced me to public health as an agency. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. I was dismayed to discover that the monies advanced in the past crises had dwindled and again we were unprepared and required a rapid response/buildup. This was accomplished by diverting staff from other public health efforts as prior funding provided no “free board” for the “waves” of such emergencies. Supplies stockpiled by the federal government after the last crises were neglected and discovered to be not available/functional. Again we were trying to “MacGyver” ventilators, PPE, etc. These experiences of feast/famine are not a rational template to provide the everyday and exceptional, essential tasks public health is required to address. Oregon has joined other states in a modernization effort to ensure our communities have a forward-looking and adequately funded public health sector. This effort is well underway, yet incomplete. During the current legislative session, public health modernization is again up for funding. I’m sure that we all recognize the vital work of public health (wildfire smoke, addiction, infectious diseases, extreme weather, rural health, EMS, etc. both within the agency and in concert with our community partners. Public health also addresses the numerous, unrecognized services that protect our families, our neighbors, our county. I urge our community to contact their elected representatives to supportfull fundingof this essential service. Boom and bust is not any way to fund an essential community resource.

We’re proud that Suffolk’s own Cindy Lane will be among the artists competing for the event’s cash prizes.It’s impressive to see Suffolk through the eyes and talents of others courtesy of the outdoor painting event. Plein air, at its simplest, is just the art of painting outdoors, but there’s more to it than that. Plein air artists are committed to capturing the scene as they see it, including the natural light, and enjoying the atmosphere that comes along with it.This excellent event has brought a lot of people to Suffolk and once again pinned us in a positive light for the art world. We thank the Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts and the many sponsors of this event for putting this together and wish the artists and their traveling companions a great time in our city.A good chance to get in on the fun is 6-9:30 p.m. Sept. 8 at the Suffolk Art Gallery, which will host the festival’s Wet Paint Sale and Soiree. Attendees will meet the artists, view their new artwork and have a chance to purchase the Suffolk-themed pieces. Tickets are $100 each and available at www.SuffolkPleinAir.org.Another of our favorite events, the Taste of Suffolk Downtown Street Festival, happens the next day from 11 a.m.-5 p.m., followed by live music in Courthouse Park until 8 p.m.Taste of Suffolk is in its 17th year of attracting visitors from across the region. The event site will stretch down Main Street from Finney Avenue to Washington Street, and along West Washington to Saratoga.Main Street will be lined with Suffolk’s independent restaurants presenting their signature menu items.

leoweekly_2023_18,"Blame it on climate change.June, 2023 begin with even more record heat events throughout the country. The power grids in the south and west were straining to handle the load. Donald J. Trump, already hot under the collar, was not happy when rolling power outages cut the air conditioning to Mar-a-Lago. Diet Coke lost its appeal for him when served at room temperature. Always a fitful sleeper, bedroom temperatures approaching 83° were similarly annoying to him. Fox and Newsmax were showing up only intermittently on his TV. But what he did see was alarming. In the same way that he was enraged when Fox called Arizona for Biden back in 2020, they were now reporting the prosecution‘s case against him for obstruction of justice pointed toward a likely conviction.Amidst all of this, he did allow himself some satisfaction. In the past several weeks he had busied himself with messages and encouragement from his lifelong MAGA (Make America Gasp Again troops. They included the Loud Noise. The Oath Bleepers. And the ThreePointTwo Percenters. He knew they were with him to the bitter end. He didn’t even have to concoct the upcoming conspiracy on his own. It was they who proposed the idea and surreptitiously communicated their plans to him. Trump could just sit back and welcome the lawbreaking they outlined. He would be blameless. The Patriots would rise up one more time. Yes, sometimes in order to save the village you do first have to burn it down. Murder and mayhem resonated with him. You Tread on Me? You’re Dead to Me.The strategy was diabolically simple. Starting on June 8, his troops would be ready to mobilize in all 50 states. Slowly and inconspicuously at first. Then building day by day.Thursday, June 8An ideal beginning salvo. The activists were already calling it “Let’s Go Brandon”. Designed to counteract the $958 million project established at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam near Joliet, Illinois. Years of effort designed to keep the Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes ecosystem 50 miles away. The Brandon Militia would physically transport thousands of carp northeast and release them into Lake Michigan under cover of darkness. Nothing to draw attention to themselves. Just a bunch of good old boys taking their boats out for an insidious “catch and release “. Of course it would take a few years to wreak total havoc on the fishing industry but this was a sinister approach and had the added benefit of sticking it to scientists. Electric barrier to keep out an invasive species? The money would’ve been better spent at the border to keep out the drugs, crime, and rapists Trump warned about years ago.Friday, June 9With rolling blackouts already occurring, it was less noticeable when hackers infiltrated Midwest power grids and began their operation. Milwaukee, Chicago, Indianapolis and Detroit were the first affected. The attacks were timed to coincide with the evening rush-hour. Residents became uneasy when 15 minutes elapsed and the air conditioning remained off. Thousands trapped in elevators. Traffic lights out. Hospitals running on generators. An hour passed. Then two. Then three. Officials did get the grid up and running by late evening so most Americans were aggravated, but no widespread panic. Shit happens, most reasoned. It was hot after all.Saturday, June 10.This plan went further up the command chain. It required seasoned saboteurs. Those with expertise in pulsed electromagnetic energy. Fortunately, 60 Minutes provided the roadmap in their episode explaining that Havana Syndrome first observed in 2016 now totaled over a thousand cases. Turns out it was feasible to focus microwave energy from a considerable distance on unsuspecting Americans, like those in government offices. Both inside the beltway and out in the heartland. By the end of the day, calls to 911 multiplied coast to coast. Excruciating head pain, convulsions, vertigo, etc. Many doctors recognized the signs of Havana Syndrome and most suspected foreign actors, particularly Russia for obvious reasons. Thus, the domestic terrorists responsible who had amassed the equipment ahead of time were left off Homeland Security’s growing threat level for the weekend. But a sense of dread was now building in Washington.Sunday, June 11Nothing says America like baseball and apple pie. Especially baseball. Loud Noise was ready to step up to the plate, both literally and figuratively. Security guards at all the major ballparks were still checking backpacks and purses, but it was often haphazard. The Loud Noise troops smuggled the fire crackers inside their pockets. The goal was not to directly harm the fans, just to exploit how everyone was on edge in public settings. Firecrackers going off unexpectedly were now routinely thought to be gunshots. In packed ballparks, a few dozen of them in the left field and right field concourses and in the bleachers resulted in the devastating stampedes. Again capitalizing on America’s divide, only stadiums in blue states were selected. Generally both coasts and Washington DC. Since “Crooked Hillary” was born in Chicago, Wrigley Field was added as a special target. The crush killed over 150 Cub fans, including many kids. Perhaps the “pro-life” former president watching on television regarded it as unfortunate collateral damage. But easily justified.Monday, June 12Some version of DEFCON TWO had taken hold at the White House and Congress as Monday dawned. It was evident to everyone that Trump was orchestrating all of this, despite not a single email, call or post to social media by him. Yet again, the US government was caught flat footed. Biden summoned his Cabinet and generals to the Situation Room. Within an hour, however, saboteurs had launched drones over the ten largest airports. All air traffic was now grounded. Other than military jets, just as on 9/11, no commercial flights were permitted. Hundreds of thousands of Americans were stranded, not able to reunite with their families, at a time when everyone desired to be with their loved ones. It was like the scene from On the Beach when Gregory Peck left Australia to return to America. The haunting melody of Waltzing Matilda began to echo in the heads of older Americans.Tuesday, June 13Not content with closing down US air spaces, thousands more good old boys set out in their RVs and campers. Conveniently experiencing “mechanical breakdowns” at major bridges and tunnels, traffic became gridlocked up and down the east and west coast. Not enough wreckers and tow trucks existed to even come close to clearing the congestion. Deaths mounted in the sweltering cars when fuel ran out. Fistfights and sporadic gun shots accounted for more. Families were seen desperately kneeling in prayer.Wednesday, June 14“Happy Birthday Donald” uttered each arsonist as they traveled some of the more remote roads in the national parks. Passersby thought at first the burning of the American flags on Flag Day was meant to demonstrate the correct way to retire American flags, as authorized by the US flag code. That was until they noticed two frightening aspects. Once the flag had ignited, the owner tossed it onto the dry brush at the shoulder of the road. Moreover, everyone seemed to be live streaming the activity. Even with real time broadcasting of the crime, park and forest officials and firefighters were too short staffed to intervene. The drought stricken western half of America would be ablaze by the weekend.The fires burned brightly. Savagely. Intensely. A sickening orange hue blanketed America in a shade reminiscent of a lengthy tie, hair and complexion.The nightmare of this week in June, 2023 evoked another one 8 years earlier. Specifically, June 16, . The hotel. The escalator. The spectacle. The ungodly gaudiness of it all.But suddenly, Melania’s stiletto heel catches in the escalator tread. She falls to her side, panicking. Donald “Ever the Gallant” Trump senses she’s in danger and stoops to assist her. The escalator gods then intervened a second time. Somehow, his tie gets wedged in the opening between the moving step and balustrade. The mechanism ensnares the tie inward with greater pressure. There you have it. Donald J. Trump, en route to declare his candidacy for president, is strangled moments before. Paramedics called to the lobby were unable to resuscitate. Hang Donald Trump is nothing anyone expected to see that day.Within hours, the other eleven Republican candidates at the time expressed their heartfelt condolences to the family along with their thoughts and prayers. On June 17, they all returned to the campaign trail with renewed optimism that they would be the one to accept the GOP nomination at the convention in 2016.Granting them the forum to assure everyone that America could once again be that Shining City on the Hill.A fantasy then. And a fantasy now.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_104,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Mourners gathered around San Francisco City Hall this week to remember U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, one of the most formidable politicians of her generation. Her passing meant not just the end of her political career, but also the end of a furious argument over her age and condition. Why did she stay in the Senate for so long? And even so, as one argument ends, others continue: about Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump and many others.I can’t remember the last time our country had a longer or more agonizing conversation about age. It kicked off in the most morally troubling way possible, in the early days of the pandemic, when a number of politicians, celebrities and even ordinary people minimized the severity of the disease in language that diminished the value of older Americans.Notoriously, in March 2020, Dan Patrick, lieutenant governor of Texas, went on Tucker Carlson’s television show and suggested that senior citizens should be “willing to take a chance” on their survival to preserve the American economy. In New York, nursing home deaths were deliberately concealed, an act that publicly minimized the magnitude of the loss.Right-wing influencer Candace Owens dismissed the seriousness of COVID-19, because, in her words, “people think it’s novel that 80-year-olds are dying at a high rate from a flu.” I heard similar sentiments from members of my own community throughout the lockdowns. I can’t tell you how many times someone said, when an older person died, “How much time did they have left anyway?”This debate unfolded as the term “OK Boomer” was taking off, both as a silly mockery of tech-ignorant grandparents and an angry battle cry against an older generation that younger Americans believe failed them. Worse still, they just won’t get out of the way.It’s impossible to ignore the advanced age of key American leaders. Biden is 80. Trump is 77. McConnell is 81. Chuck Grassley is 90. Feinstein was 90 when she died in office. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was 87. Age was on 76-year-old Mitt Romney’s mind when he announced that he wouldn’t seek reelection to the Senate. “At the end of another term, I’d be in my mid-80s. Frankly, it’s time for a new generation of leaders,” he said.I don’t equate all these situations. Some of the sentiments expressed at the start of the pandemic were monstrous. Concerns about aging and often infirm leaders at the highest levels of American politics, in all three branches of government, are far more understandable and much less grotesque than asking senior citizens to court death in the midst of a pandemic. The generational dismissiveness inherent in “OK Boomer” lies somewhere in between. Nonetheless, there is a common theme — a shift to viewing older people in America not as assets but, rather, as obstacles. They’re barriers to our own dreams and ambitions.One column is insufficient for teasing out all the reasons for this shift, but I want to explore one aspect that bothers me greatly. The centrality of work and career to our sense of self and identity — especially in America’s educated classes — is damaging old and young alike. In 2019, Derek Thompson popularized the term “workism” in The Atlantic to describe how our careers have “morphed into a religious identity.” Earlier this year, he summed up the “history of work” like this: “from jobs to careers to callings.”In January, the Pew Research Center released a startling report describing parents’ priorities for their children. An extraordinary 88% said financial independence was extremely or very important. The same percentage placed the same priority on their kids having careers they enjoy. In contrast, only 21% said it was extremely or very important for their children to get married. A mere 20% said it was extremely or very important for their kids to have children.Workism tells older Americans who might think otherwise that their job is core to who they are. Likewise, workism tells younger Americans that their job will define them. It is core to who they’re becoming. Read in this way, it is easy to see why older Americans are reluctant to simply “step aside.” If they feel able — and it’s easier to feel able when your job centers on your mind rather than your body — then the demand to leave is an attack on their essential identity.At the same time, for those who are seeking to forge their identity, the obstacle of aging leadership can be maddening. Young professionals do seek mentorship, of course, but all too often, mentors are seen as valuable only so long as they keep giving. And then, when they’ve given all they can, they must decrease, so that their proteges can increase and take their place in the sun.It’s necessary to think hard about our first answers to a deceptively simple question: “Who are you?” If my honest first response is “I am a columnist” more than a husband, a father or a grandfather, then when I get older I will wrap my arms around that identity and refuse to let go. If that first answer is centered on faith and family, then the sunset of my career will not be the sunset of my purpose. I will be more willing to release that which I value less because I still preserve that which I value most.But just as older Americans can have an obligation to let go of professions and power, young Americans can have obligations to hold on to their elders, to treasure them rather than shove them aside. Ancient wisdom can speak to modern conflicts, and ever since the onset of the generational conflicts during the pandemic, I’ve pondered a key part of the Westminster Larger Catechism, an almost 400-year-old statement of Protestant theology. It takes an expansive view of the Fifth Commandment, “Honor thy father and thy mother.” The catechism asserts that father and mother don’t merely refer to your biological parents, but to “all superiors in age and gifts.”And what duties do we owe to the older people in our lives? The catechism outlines a beautiful balance. We are called to the “defense and maintenance of their persons and authority” at the same time that we are “bearing with their infirmities, and covering them in love.” In a true ethic of respect and care, the spirit of “OK Boomer” is nowhere to be found.The Romney Christmas card is legendary in some niche circles in Washington. Every December, he sends out a simple picture of his growing family. You can Google it and see it expand, year by year. First, he and his five sons could field a Romney basketball team. Then, when the sons married and had children, they could field a Romney football team. But that picture is also a declaration — this is who I am.Skeptics might claim that Romney let go of his power because holding it would be hard. In these polarized times, he was vulnerable to a challenge from the Utah right. Perhaps, but it’s also true that he retains immense purpose, and the picture captures that purpose. An ethos that locates our meaning in those relationships can tell the young to value the wisdom and experience of the old and tell our nation’s older generations that great blessings can flow from the end of even the most rewarding careers.© 2023 The New York Times CompanyHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_90,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In this space we do the talking, about what the Daily News deems important and worthy. But today we are giving a good chunk of our space to Secretary of State Tony Blinken. America’s top diplomat gave his year-end press conference Wednesday before he left for another trip to the Mideast for the Israel-Hamas war that the terror gang launched from Gaza on Oct. 7.Meanwhile, here on the East Side, the United Nations Security Council postponed yet again a vote on an United Arab Emirates-drafted resolution calling for a pause in the fighting to bring in aid to Gaza and allow for the hostages kidnaped by Hamas to be released.The Monday vote became the Tuesday vote became the Wednesday vote and is now the Thursday vote because the U.S. is rightly insisting that Hamas be named as instigators of this awful war that has killed Israelis and Palestinians.Great credit to Blinken and President Joe Biden for demanding that the Security Council must call a terrorist a terrorist.Here is Blinken:“We’ve talked about Israel and Gaza. Let me just say this. We believe that, as we’ve said from the outset, Israel has not only a right but an obligation to defend itself and to try to make sure that Oct. 7 never happens again. Any other country in the world faced with what Israel suffered on Oct. 7 would do the same thing.“We’ve also said — and we’ve been very clear — that how Israel does it matters and matters tremendously. And there, too, we’ve been very deeply engaged with them to maximize protections for civilians, to maximize humanitarian assistance, to minimize harm to people in Gaza.“One of the things that’s striking to me is that, understandably, everyone would like to see this conflict end as quickly as possible, but if it ends with Hamas remaining in place and having the capacity and the stated intent to repeat Oct. 7 again and again and again, that’s not in the interests of Israel, it’s not in the interests of the region, it’s not in the interests of the world.“And what is striking to me is that even as, again, we hear many countries urging the end to this conflict, which we would all like to see, I hear virtually no one saying — demanding of Hamas that it stop hiding behind civilians, that it lay down its arms, that it surrender.“This is over tomorrow if Hamas does that. This would have been over a month ago, six weeks ago, if Hamas had done that. And how could it — how can it be that there are no demands made of the aggressor and only demands made of the victim?“So it would be good if there was a strong international voice pressing Hamas to do what’s necessary to end this. And again, that could be tomorrow.“And again, I come back to this basic proposition. There seems to be silence on what Hamas could do, should do, must do if we want to end the suffering of innocent men, women, and children. It would be, I think, good if the world could unite around that proposition as well.”Well said, Mr. Secretary.— New York Daily News"
suffolknewsherald_2023_14,"Published 5:49 pm Friday, June 23, 2023ByStaff ReportsBy Maribel Castaneda, Guest ColumnistVirginia is for all kinds of outdoor lovers. From the rolling hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains to the sandy shores of Virginia Beach, our state is home to incredible natural beauty that is unmatched anywhere else in the country. (I’m not biased or anything. Virginia’s outdoors are a precious natural resource that provide numerous benefits to residents and visitors alike. From hiking and camping to fishing and birdwatching, these outdoor spaces offer a pause from the hustle and bustle of daily life and a chance to connect with nature.I’m a champion for Virginia’s outdoors and there are many reasons why you should be, too. In 2021, outdoor recreation contributed $9.4 billion to the commonwealth’s economy and supported 107,000 jobs according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. These are big numbers, proving our natural resources are a crucial part of our state’s economy. Tourism is one of Virginia’s largest industries, and much of that tourism is driven by our state’s natural beauty. People come from all over the world to hike our trails, fish our rivers, travel in their RVs, and enjoy our beaches. By protecting our natural resources, we’re also protecting our economy and the jobs that depend on it.But the importance of Virginia’s outdoors goes beyond just economics; it is simply the right thing to do. Our natural resources are part of our state’s heritage and identity and make Virginia such a special place to live, work and visit. By working to protect our natural resources, we’re preserving a legacy for future generations. We’re ensuring that our children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy the same natural beauty that we do today.Finally, natural resources are essential for our physical and mental well-being. Study after study has shown that spending time in nature is good for our health. It reduces stress, boosts our immune systems and even improves our cognitive function. In a world where we spend so much time indoors and in front of screens, our state’s outdoors provide a much-needed escape and a chance to recharge.The recent formation of the Our Virginia Outdoors coalition is a positive step towards protecting and promoting these invaluable resources. Results of the 2017 Virginia Outdoors Demand Survey found that 70% of Virginians support public spending to prevent the loss of natural areas and open spaces. By bringing together conservationists, outdoor enthusiasts, and business leaders and other diverse stakeholders the coalition is working to ensure that Virginia’s outdoors remain healthy and accessible for generations to come. We’re building support for the recommendations found in the Virginia Outdoors Plan, the state’s comprehensive plan for land conservation, outdoor recreation and open-space planning.So whether you’re an avid biker, fisher, runner, kayaker, hunter, a nature lover or just someone who cares about the future of our state, there are many ways you can get involved. One of the easiest ways is to simply spread the word. Talk to your friends and family about the importance of protecting Virginia’s outdoors. Share information about Our Virginia Outdoors on social media and encourage others to get involved. The more people who know about the coalition, the more support we’ll have for our efforts.You could also volunteer with a local organization that’s working to protect Virginia’s outdoors. There are many groups throughout the state that are doing important work, from cleaning up our rivers to preserving our forests. By volunteering your time and skills, you can make a real difference in protecting our natural resources.June is Great Outdoors Month in the commonwealth. I’ll be enjoying some runs along the James River in Richmond and hiking trails at Massanutten Mountain. Whether you prefer a leisurely stroll through a park or a thrilling adventure in the great outdoors, Virginia has something for everyone.Maribel Castaneda is an avid outdoors enthusiast from Harrisonburg and the coordinator for Our Virginia Outdoors.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_112,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Once again, the U.S. Supreme Court finds itself at the center of a national case involving access to abortion, this time around the drug mifepristone, which along with misoprostol forms part of the regimen for a so-called medication abortion. Its ruling is expected in June, and that ruling should be clear, if only to help clean up the mess it created with its overturning of Roe v. Wade a year and a half ago.For a body that had insisted its Dobbs ruling would finally and definitively send the question of abortion to the states, it has often found itself dragged back to the debate. This should come as no surprise; it was obvious even before Dobbs was leaked that the radical groups and officials hell-bent on taking away this medical choice from women would not be satisfied with doing so only within the confines of certain states.Since Roe was first issued 50 years ago, the anti-choice movement have been very clear that they will not rest until not only is that precedent dead and buried — mission accomplished now on that — but until it is impossible for a woman or girl to avail herself of abortion care anywhere in the country, for any reason.That is precisely why state officials have, for example, endeavored to prevent women from leaving states with abortion bans for others where the care is legal; it’s clearly not about state sovereignty but control over access wholesale.In this case, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine — a preposterously named organization that in contrast to its moniker is in fact seeking to do plenty of harm — and other pseudo-medical organizations are suing the Food and Drug Administration over its 2000 approval and subsequent use authorizations of mifepristone.We’ve said it before but it’s worth repeating: no one — not one peer-reviewed study, not one serious medical group, not one government assessment — has ever determined that mifepristone is any more dangerous than thousands of other drugs on the market. In fact, the evidence has shown that it is safer than common medications like penicillin.Nor is there any particularly compelling case that there was anything irregular about the FDA’s approval of the drug, which underwent the same evaluative procedures as many others.When the plaintiffs sued, they did so on a theory of legal standing that relied entirely on hypothetical harms that they might suffer from patients suffering from the very rare complications the drug could produce, or the hypothetical liabilities they might face; apparently painting a strained theoretical scenario is now enough to be taken seriously in federal court.No surprise that the judge who first received the suit was ideological warrior Matthew Kacsmaryk, the go-to triggerman for conservative orthodoxy’s judicial drive-bys. His initial ruling was replete with language straight out of the anti-abortion activist playbook. An appeals panel correctly shot him down, but moved to overturn the 2016 and 2021 modifications that allowed mifepristone to be prescribed more easily and sent over the mail.That ruling is now stayed, and the Supreme Court should make sure it never goes into effect. Sadly, the consequences of a lack of safe abortion procedures, unlike the plaintiffs’ standing, is far from hypothetical. If mifepristone is banned, more women will suffer, and more will die.—New York Daily News Editorial Board/TNS"
suffolknewsherald_2023_203,"Published 5:31 pm Tuesday, September 5, 2023ByStaff ReportsAs we are now back to school, I’ve been thinking about all those involved in education. Praying for their safety and success.It’s a tough job, but few things are more noble pursuits than the education of others.In the past, I taught math for six years at Kings Fork Middle School. It gave me experiences, and education, that will last my lifetime. Having gone through somewhere around 23 years of school now. I’ve seen and written my share of questions. Homework, in class, bellringer assignments, quizzes, exams and so on. From the 50/50 odds of true or false questions, to multiple choice, essays in blue books, and figuring out solutions to differential equations — today I would not even know how to read those.There’s an art to the way questions are written. Not paying attention to how they are asked could lead you down the wrong path in your answer.In the lesson given by the master teacher, Jesus, in Matthew 16: 13-20, He asks questions in just the way you should.Simple enough to understand, and yet, not without needed rigor. The kind of questions that you can answer quickly, if you choose. They could be discussed among a group to do what the best questions do- they go beyond assessing knowledge, and create an opportunity for increased learning. Which, in the end, is the goal of education.His first question, “Who do people say the son of man is?” gets responses from much of the class. His second question, though asked to all of them, is recorded as only answered by Simon Peter.Simon Peter answered him with what seems to be an answer Jesus is very satisfied with in content, but there also seems to be an element where Jesus says, ”Hey, you are blessed, not just because you got the right answer, but because I know that God, the Father in Heaven, gave it to you.”God has answered many things for me, but not all. Yet, I’m learning to become more appreciative of the questions I’ve been led to explore, than the answers I think I find. Questions that lead me to transformation. I’m blessed to have been transformed, and to continue being transformed.There’s something about this interaction that may be missed.Jesus asks the questions, both of them, to the group. Though we only know of Simon Peter’s response, the questions were asked to the community of his closest students, friends, and disciples, as many of us strive to be.How we answer these questions as individuals is interesting and somewhat important. I believe the far more interesting, educational and engaging responses to Jesus are our communal responses. In our words, and in our actions as the wider Church, as a city of many faiths, ever evolving, and constantly learning. Don’t just answer these questions yourselves, or within your Christian gatherings. Ask them of your non-Christian neighbors. Find out what they think, and listen with an understanding heart, and open ears.Suffolk, who do we say Jesus is? What do our neighbors, whom we are commanded to love, think?May our answers to these questions never cease to flow in loving ways from our mouths, our hands, our feet, and our hearts.The Rev.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_69,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°Like most Americans, we were introduced to lawyer Sidney Powell on Nov. 19, 2020, almost two weeks after it was clear that Joe Biden had decisively beaten President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Powell showed up at a Trump campaign press conference at RNC headquarters in Washington along with Rudy Giuliani and another lawyer, Jenna Ellis.This was Rudy’s second infamous post-election press conference. The first was at Philly’s Four Seasons Total Landscaping on Nov. 7, which occurred just as the Associated Press and the TV networks all projected Biden’s victory.You remember, this press conference is where Rudy’s brown hair dye dripped down both sides of his face as he and Powell and Ellis spun lies and craziness about Hugo Chavez and stolen votes.All three of them would later be indicted in the Georgia state election interference case. Powell would also become Co-Conspirator 3 in Special Counsel Jack Smith’s federal election interference case filed in Washington.On Tuesday, Powell was still on social media claiming that the 2020 presidential vote was crooked. On Wednesday, an Atlanta judge rejected her final efforts to toss out the seven state felony charges against her for election interference on two specious grounds: one that it was a federal election and should not be handled in state court and the other was her First Amendment right to free speech. Her trial was set to begin on Monday.No way, wrote Judge Scott McAfee Wednesday afternoon, the charges stood. The next morning, yesterday, Powell had a change of heart and pleaded guilty in open court before McAfee to six misdemeanors and promised to cooperate.This is good for Powell, who will serve no prison time and is eligible under Georgia law to even have her conviction expunged at some point in the future. It’s also good for prosecutor Fani Willis, who can rely on Powell to rat out the others in the case, including Trump.And Powell has dirt on Trump. Smith described her as “an attorney whose unfounded claims of election fraud Trump privately acknowledged to others sounded “crazy.”Nonetheless, Trump embraced and publicly amplified Co-Conspirator 3’s disinformation.”Powell was at the Dec. 18, 2020 Oval Office meeting where there was a plot discussed to use the power of the federal government to seize voting machines in states that Trump narrowly lost, like Georgia. The cabal, which included disgraced National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, went on for hours and continued in the White House residence.Powell has first-hand knowledge of this, as it was her plan. Hopefully, she will be cooperating with Jack Smith as well.The conspiracy of the sitting president to stay in office by canceling the election that he lost was very real and it exploded in its final act, the Jan. 6 sacking of the Capitol. Powell was there for much of it and can offer prosecutors the insider view.Trump assumed that all his stooges would remain blindly loyal to him and refuse to testify against him. Powell has proven him very wrong. Is she crazy, as he thought? Probably, but she still likely has the goods on his crimes to defraud the American people and democracy itself.Trump can lead his rivals in the polls for the GOP nomination, but he can’t outrun the law.—New York Daily News Editorial BoardHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

They were my only reference to what a woman should look like — delicate.My body and energy were never delicate. I was a big-backed, upside-down triangle with small hips and legs. My head was huge with a wide nose, high cheekbones, and a large mouth.My energy was masculine, bold by nature, and I had defiance in my soul, a brash temperament and a cackle of a laugh from day one. My mouth uttered truths that children should maybe not know and certainly not comment on.I simply looked and felt different, and I clung to my father as the only evidence that I was not adopted. I can only assume the reasons why my father did not share his heritage, culture, and traditions within our own family, but I felt ripped off for many years.English was my father’s second language. I never heard him speak Spanish outside of the phone calls to his siblings and mother. He shared nothing of himself as a Mexican American outside of his enchiladas, chorizo, and menudo.He could never fully make the “sh” sound, so I could hear his native accent as he would utter “chit” instead of shit, and renamed my cousin “Cherry” instead of Sherry. He presented himself as a soldier and Midwestern father but nothing else of his background.I have a distinct memory: late in the evenings after I was already in my jammies and bathed, I snuck to the edge of the stairs and listened to my dad become a completely different person. Beautiful phrases came out of his mouth; he spoke louder. He was more animated and loose.I had no idea what he was saying because my sister and I were never taught Spanish.An awakening came when I was in middle school, after a few visits to California, when I finally met women who were just like me. They spoke with quick tongues, had loud and boisterous laughs from deep in their bellies, and ran chaotic homes with a steady rhythm that secretly showed who was really in charge.My grandmother was a strong matriarch of a large family, and was adored by all. She spoke limited English, offered a formal Catholic blessing as you entered her home, and locked my mother, sister and me in a room away from the late-night shenanigans of the adults that lasted into the early mornings.I was in awe of my grandmother and her strong, silent ways. I watched her prepare food. She had an entire cow tongue laid out for dinner and I asked questions about what it was. She saw the disgust in my face and warmed up a tortilla right on the burner, then doused it with butter and cinnamon sugar for a comforting snack. I wanted to be like her and felt connected to her deep in my belly. She was the touchstone for all things I did not know about my father, and I soaked up every minute in her presence.English wasn’t common in the neighborhood of 3232 Winter Street, and our play area was a small patch of grass in the back of the bungalow surrounded by concrete. My cousins laughed at me as I preferred to go barefoot to the store. The language barrier didn’t seem to affect our playtime.We were curious about our differences and celebrated each other’s presence. It was a world I had been denied and it affected me deeply.Now, I enjoy the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, and I am just happy to see recognition of my Latin roots. Even though I feel I missed a lot, it brings me a piece of my dad each year.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_86,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°More than a year and a half after Russia invaded Ukraine, Western leaders continue to support that country’s valiant efforts to repel an unprovoked invasion. But the U.S. Congress needs to act swiftly to provide new assistance. It must not be distracted by fatigue among the American public or the ominous opposition of some Republicans in Congress to further assistance.It’s heartening that NATO officials this week assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that more than $2 billion in additional military assistance will be provided before winter. But NATO countries, including the United States, need to do more, even as they appropriately disclaim any intention to deploy their own troops in the conflict.After Congress passed a stopgap funding measure that didn’t include more aid for Ukraine, President Joe Biden rightly argued that Congress must provide more assistance. “The vast majority of both parties — Democrats and Republicans, Senate and House — support helping Ukraine and the brutal aggression that is being thrust upon them by Russia,” Biden said. “Stop playing games, get this done.’”In August, Biden asked lawmakers to approve an additional $24 billion in aid, but some supporters of Ukraine in Congress reportedly want the president to propose a larger appropriation— perhaps as much as $100 billion — to support Ukraine’s self-defense through the 2024 U.S. presidential election. There is also speculation that Biden might propose linking new aid for Ukraine to additional military assistance to Israel following the vicious attack on that country by Hamas militants.The U.S. has directed more than $75 billion in humanitarian, financial and military assistance to Ukraine and approved billions more for other purposes, including protecting other countries in Europe that feel threatened by Russia. In all, Congress has approved $113 billion in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Americans might wonder why such large sums are necessary, given other pressing needs.Some may also ask why, if the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine are so important, the U.S. and its NATO are not committing troops to the fight.There are good answers to those questions. The assistance the U.S. and its allies have provided does more than help Ukraine defend itself. It puts Vladimir Putin on notice that Russian aggression elsewhere — including against NATO member states — would come at a steep price. Deployment of NATO troops to assist Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, would risk a war between the alliance and Russia.Ideally this war would end with a negotiated settlement under which Russia would relinquish all Ukrainian territory.A peace agreement conceivably could include some concessions to Russia, but Biden rightly has emphasized that one of the purposes of aid is to put Ukraine “in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.”The U.S. and its allies must not jeopardize that outcome by softening their support for Ukraine.—Los Angeles Times Editorial Board/TNSHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2023_192,"Published 3:32 pm Friday, September 15, 2023ByStaff ReportsWe will soon be in 2023’s ninth month. Just 23 years ago we entered the first hundred years of a new millennium with excitement — our first in 2000 A.D. — Anno Domini- the “year of our Lord” accounting.Millennium means a thousand years. Even the youngest people alive today may not be around when the second hundred years dawns for our grand- and great-grandchildren. Even now, just 23 years later, I am looking back and wondering what happened that has so dramatically changed all our lives, our country and our world. What are we leaving behind for them?I am one of those who remembers the way things were before COVID-19 knocked us down. We had had a somewhat peaceful few years until we became a partof the “masked generation” debut. We were encouraged by our leaders to obey what they said. But like the giant slide in the “Fun House” at the beach resort near where I grew up, it was the beginning of our slide down a slippery slope with almost nothing to hold onto. Once down the slide, we found it difficult to climb back up.Someone gave me a T-shirt with this reminder printed on it: “Normal is not coming back but Jesus is.” How thankful I am that Jesus left us with that promise. We can read what He said in the Bible, John 14. Some call it “the blessed hope.” If I did not have that hope I would be “fearful” — full of fear.I am seeing changes I never would have imagined. Some readers often consider the elderly “out of touch.”I know life does not stand still and have always found it good to get or give advice. The pathway of life is always expected to move forward, but perhaps more slowly than it has in the past few years.When I hear the proposals of my government and its allies, I see deep gorges in the road up ahead. We have mostly become used to having. The credit card blocks our view of how much we should spend. Some people, even businesses, have been accused of taking advantage of others.We hear the news but no longer trust what is written or told us, whether it is truth or fiction. Accusations and ugly words are being thrown around everywhere and by so many people. Our young children are listening. They are influenced by a society where civility is in short supply. Those watching TV can see it.Is there no hope for our nation? For our children? Yes, but it has to come from God, Bible teaching and committed Bible teachers and preachers.We still have access to all of God’s promises. He is still God, the Almighty Creator, willing to hear our prayers when we repent and surrender our lives to Him. Let’s take advantage of what He has promised and do that.Myrtle V. Thompson, ret.

suffolknewsherald_2023_43,"Published 3:28 pm Friday, May 19, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldSuffolk has been blessed with terrific elected and civic leadership over the years, but few have left a mark like Joe Barlow, who died last month at age 94.Mayor Mike Duman, during Tuesday’s State of the City address, aptly described Barlow as a “true gentleman and dedicated public servant” whose “honesty and integrity were beyond reproach.” What a fitting tribute at an event where the community gets a chance annually to celebrate another year of progress on many fronts, thanks in large part to those who laid the foundation for success.Joe Barlow certainly did his part to help make Suffolk the thriving city it is today.He was not even 60 years old yet when the downtown Rotary Club named him Suffolk’s First Citizen in 1985, a nod to his tremendous influence even as a young leader. He would go on to serve the city as elected leader, representing the Chuckatuck Borough on the Suffolk City Council.Duman told the wonderful anecdote of his own, Barlow-inspired entry into politics.“My relationship with Joe Barlow is more than just performing a mayoral duty in mentioning his passing,” Duman told the State of the City crowd. “Joe was responsible for me becoming involved in public service. In 2009 he called and convinced me to serve on the economic development authority. That initial involvement with local government started the journey I have been on for the last 14 years.“Mr. Barlow was my predecessor on City Council representing the Chuckatuck Borough. In 2010, I heard that he was not going to seek reelection. Several individuals encouraged me to run and I was in the process of collecting signatures. I soon heard that Mr. Barlow had already garnered his signatures and was registered.“I called Joe to confirm that he was seeking reelection and, if so, I would not run. He told me that he was going to be 82 in just a few months and the reason he registered is that he was unsure if there would be a qualified candidate to take his seat on council. He was only running to ensure his Chuckatuck residents would have the representation they deserved. Once he discovered, in his opinion, that there were two qualified candidates seeking his seat he withdrew from the election.“This exemplifies the dedication and genuine concern that Joe Barlow had for his fellow citizens.”Indeed. We join all of Suffolk in commending Barlow’s life of selfless service and his lasting impact on our community.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

leoweekly_2023_59,"Students from Kentucky K-12 schools will join college students in Frankfort tomorrow morning, March 29, to protestSB150, which would allow for schools and teachers to misgender youth based on personally-held beliefs and requires schools to give parents two-weeks notice on any lessons in human sexuality. The bill also institutes a ban on gender-affirming medical care and adds a requirement for doctors to set a timeline to detransition youth who are already taking hormone therapies. Schools would no longer be allowed to address sexual orientation or gender with youth, nor begin teaching basic human sexuality information before the sixth grade. Schools would have to establish bathroom policies and students would be barred from legally changing their names or birth certificates. Governor Andy Beshear vetoed the bill on March 24, but the Republican super majority in the legislature could override that veto during the last two days of the legislative session on March 29 and 30.The bill directly contradicts prominent research regardinggender-affirming careand the basic education of young people regardinghealthy human sexual relationships.Students from Atherton, Liberty, Waggener, and PRP high schools will be joined in Frankfort by students from Ramsey Middle, Bowing Elementary, Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS , as well as members ofLouisville Youth Group,Progress Kentucky,Transcending Stigma,Frontrunners Lexington, JCPS school psychologists and LGBTQ advisory committee members, amongst others. The students, parents, and partnering organizations will meet in Frankfort at the capitol around 11 a.m.In an effort to help students process the events that have put their medical care and personhood at risk, teachers from Atherton High School gave students the opportunity to respond to the anti-trans sentiment in letters.“We have asked our members to write what their preferred pronouns mean to them,” said Atherton chemistry teacher Jules Picuri. “And, their responses are quite compelling and heartfelt. We want our legislators to hear their words and stories.”LEO is sharing these letters with the hopes that the local community hears what these young people have to say about their identities and the importance of the adults around them supporting the growth and discovery of who they are. Some of the letters are below, but you can read them all in the11-page document shared with LEO.Even if you don’t support our communities, please at least respect us and our lifestyles. We’ve fought for years to get where we are today, and to see it stripped awayso easily is heartbreaking. Please, vote alongside us. My life depends on it.—CTI found out that I was trans back in the summer of 8th grade. I first came out to my best friend. I held off telling my parents due to being scared of their reactions. After telling my parents I told my therapist. He would often ask me questions about why I felt the way I did. This went on for some while. I later found out that my therapist at the time just told my parents that the way I was feeling was a phase. I often found myself listening to a song called “The Village” by Wrabel. I would find myself crying to this song. There was a part of the song that hit me the most. “No, your mom don t get it. And your dad don t get it, Uncle John don t get it. And you can t tell grandma. Cause her heart can t take it and she might not make it. They say, Don t dare, don t you even go there. Cutting off your long hair. You do as you re told. Tell you, Wake up, go put on your makeup. This is just a phase you re gonna outgrow This part hit me hard because I felt like I had no one to go to, no one who would understand. I felt like I was wrong, that what I was doing wasn’t okay, that it wasn’t normal.For the longest time I never said anything more because I didn’t like the fact that my parents thought that it was just a phase and that I would grow out of it. It hurt because to me it felt as though they didn’t believe me. I went through times where I thought that maybe I should just accept the fact that I was born a female. That I shouldn’t try to push how I identified. Oftentimes I had thought of just ending it all. I had thought that it would be the easiest thing to do, if I ended it all I wouldn’t have to constantly try to tell people that I wasn’t going through a phase, that there wasn’t anything wrong with me, that I wasn’t doing this for attention.It got better, my parents came around. They make some mistakes here and there but I know that they’re trying. But on October 20, 2022 things changed. I got overstressed and after someone made a comment to me I tried to kill myself. Their comment made me come to terms with reality. They said “You know even if you get all these surgeries you’ll never be an actual guy. You weren’t born a male and you’ll just have to live with that knowledge.” I came home that night frustrated and irritated. I was hurt… I didn’t want my parents to know. Memories with what I had to go through just to be accepted by people I loved and cared about came rushing back to me. All those doubts and insecurities hit me. I had never been more emotionally damaged than I was right then. So I tried to kill myself. I was done living like that. I was done letting people tell me what was right and what was wrong. I was done with people not believing me. I just wanted it all to end.This is just what happened to me. But this could be a huge factor in someone else’s life. This could be the choice that decides whether or not someone will stay on this earth on this day next year. So please think hard about your decisions. I’ve had to go through so much heartache and struggle. Please don’t do this to someone else.I am a seventeen year old student at Atherton High School. I am a transgender man, and I have struggled for so long learning who I am. I am currently in a relationship with another man, whose identity will also not be disclosed. I have spent the last seven years of my life trying to figure out who I am as a person. Many people in my life have told me that I just need to be myself, but it seems like any time that I try to do that, the government or my own family is out to get me. I found out that I wasn’t a girl in the sixth grade, and I started to refer to myself as a demi-girl, or someone who only partially identifies as a woman.Since then, I have slowly begun to figure out that I am not a girl at all. I am a man in the wrong body. I found this out in the eighth grade, after an assignment at a school in Indiana had me begin questioning who I was again. I’ve always known that I liked any and all people, I knew it from when I was a little kid, and I sobbed to my mother in the car, “Mama, I think that I like girls!” and she said that it was alright to like girls. But, I don’t believe that she thought that I would still like girls and boys and anything in between or outside of it to this day. About a year ago, I came out to my mother as non-binary, although I still knew that I was a man– I believed that this would be the gentlest approach to her accepting me. She told me, “No, you’re not nonbinary, because I do not feel like you are nonbinary.”This stung, and it still bleeds like an open wound tended to with salt every time one of these new laws are introduced. I remember the Thanksgiving day when I came out to my family as bisexual, and they didn’t mind it one bit. Only this year, I came out to my mother as pansexual and trans. She was on the fence for a while, but she’s been trying her hardest to be supportive of me, and I appreciate that so much. I understand how hard it is for her, but can you imagine how difficult it is for kids without supportive parents?And for the longest time, I was kept in the dark about how my Aunt’s side of the family truly felt about gay people. My Aunt believes that gay people shouldn’t marry, and that transgender people shouldn’t exist. She told my 10 year old cousin, now 11, that, “Transgender people kill themselves because they are transgender.”For the longest time, that has stuck with me. The fact that a grown woman would tell a child that transgender people only kill themselves because they were transgender was outrageous. There’s so much more to that than just “being trans”. The fact that we as a minority deal with laws being passed to take away such simple rights such as using the bathroom, or using a preferred name, or even pronouns is what leads young individuals to kill themselves.Having no support from their families or education system makes it even worse. Even in times of great need, now the school system isn’t even safe anymore. For many kids, this has already been an issue, but at the very least, it got them away from their unsupportive family. Now that these laws are being put in place, and dragged into school systems, issues like feeling like they aren’t wanted anywhere are going to arise even more than they previously had.The reason that transgender people kill themselves, isn’t because “they are trans”, it’s because of the constant lack of support from their families, from the government — the constant harassment from other people that don’t “agree with their lifestyles”— the berating that they receive from parents that don’t support them, sending them to camps or abusing them and telling them that they need to “fix themselves”— getting kicked out of their homes simply for saying that they have a transgender friend, or that they are transgender— these laws being passed taking away their rights every single day, whether or not it s a nationwide or a statewide law– being told that they can’t receive care because they don’t align with what they were assigned with at birth — issues with their bodies and how other people perceive their bodies… and so so much more that can’t even be put into words.I remember when I went to my old school, before Atherton, I would get bullied for being a “weird kid” or even get called names or derogatory terms just for wanting to be anything but a girl. I knew who I was, and despite that, I was still being told who I had to. I’m nearly legally an adult, and now– not only are transphobes and homophobes around me doing it, but the government itself is telling me that I don’t deserve to have rights. That I don’t deserve to be human. It makes me sick to see these laws being passed, especially with barely supporting parents, and horrible family members. I’ve seen kids younger than me being assaulted and killed by their fellow students, or even their own family. I’ve had friends tell me that their parents have said hateful and hurtful things to them just for saying that they were thinking of being something else that they previously weren’t. I’ve dealt with my Aunt spewing constant hatred, teaching her own child to do the same.I know how difficult it is to be transgender in America. I know how much it hurts to have family not support you. I know how much it hurts to be told that you’re worthless, just because you’re trying to “be who you are”. This country talks so much about how we reserve our rights to freedom– our rights to represent ourselves. Where are our rights to simply be human? Where are our rights to breathe, to sleep, to eat the same way that all other human beings on this planet get to? Why don’t we get to take a walk on the street with our families without being called some derogatory term, or without getting the shit beaten out of us for wearing a skirt or a binder? Why don’t we get to be just like you are? What have we done wrong to deserve the way that we’re being treated in these coming years?I want you to answer these questions in due time. I want you to sit down and think about the seventeen year old asking you, begging and pleading for you to give him reasons why he isn’t viewed the same way that everyone else is– the reasoning for what he, what transgender people as a whole, have done to be treated this way by the enforcement they rely upon to protect them. I’ve always wanted to be a politician so I can do what s right for this country. But every single day, I see that chance becoming slimmer and slimmer, and hope is barely within our grasp. We are people too, and we hope that you see that.*** ."

eugeneweekly_2023_28,"We ve got issues. Ifind it’s easy to make assumptions or judgments about people. Recently, one hot late-summer morning, I was getting ready to water my front yard and back garden. As I walked outside towards my sidewalk, I noticed a group of loud talking young boys sitting in front of my neighbor’s fence with all their packs and gear askew. There was also an assortment of pop cans on the parking strip. “Oh great! They will probably leave a mess.” I decided to water my backyard first. When I returned to the front yard, a few of the boys were standing with their heavy packs hoisted upon their backs; others were sitting, still sorting through their junk. The talking had gotten louder. “Oh well,” I thought, “I have to water.” With my hose spraying my flowers and vegetables, I snuck a look their way. A few of these young boys or young men were ready to travel on. One of them came from across the street to meet the group using the F-word. Another one looked over my way and said, “Sorry, Ma’am.” Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Those two little words changed everything for me. I shed my frustration and replied, “Thank you for saying that.” By now most of the group were heading down the street. One young boy was left on the sidewalk putting his final items into his pack. The pop cans continued to lay in the dirt. Slowly, though, I watched as this young man picked up each can and put it in his pack. “Thank you so much for cleaning up. People often leave such a mess.” I am an outgoing person and can easily talk with most strangers. This kid started reminding me of all the kids I taught as a teacher at Looking Glass’s Riverfront School. “Do you have your high school diploma?” I asked. “I have my GED,” he replied. “That’s so great! Where are you from?” “Junction City,” he replied. Our talk flowed easily. I began wondering how this kid came to be on the street. But I didn’t ask. As he was getting ready to leave and join the rest of his crew, he told me: “Be sure to drink plenty of water. It’s a hot day.” My thoughts started pouring in: What a sweet kid. He’s caring about me, and he’s on the street. Why is he on the street, I wondered. What is his family like? His pack was on his back, and he told me that St. Vincent had these white tents by their store where they let street kids sleep. He also mentioned that he wanted to get some kind of job and save his money so he’d be able to get a room in an apartment. Why do we criminalize and put down the homeless? Why do we stereotype kids who are on the street? As I watched him walking down my block, I remembered I had some leftover homemade taquitos. I quickly gathered them from my refrigerator and ran after him. “Hey, hey.” I said loudly. He stopped and turned around as I approached. “Here, please take these. I made them and they might fall apart but they have good ingredients.” He smiled broadly, “Don’t forget to drink plenty of water.”"
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_132,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°While the Biden administration has maintained its strong support of Israel’s war aim of eliminating Hamas in Gaza, that support has for weeks been tempered by statements from U.S. officials saying Israel needs to minimize deaths of civilians as it continues fighting.Those mild rebukes appear to have been ignored by the Israelis. Their continued widespread bombing has raised the death toll in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, to 18,600. And the growing tension between Biden and Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, broke into the open on Dec. 12. Biden warned Israel that it is “losing support” over the war. Netanyahu publicly disagreed with the U.S. goal of having the Palestinian Authority run Gaza.The Conversation’s senior politics and democracy editor Naomi Schalit interviewed Gregory F. Treverton of USC Dornsife, a former chairman of the National Intelligence Council in the Obama administration, about the divisions between Israel and the U.S. In the end, Israel’s behavior, says Treverton, shows “the limits of influence” the U.S. holds.Q: The U.S. has criticized Israel’s conduct of the war. Israel has ignored that criticism. That looks like humiliation for the Biden administration. What is going on?A: This is a pattern we’ve seen before. We saw it in the war Israel fought against Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006. The U.S. was trying to push Israel to be more humane in the way they conducted that war. So while the disagreement is not especially new, it is not just humiliating but also shows the limits of influence.Indeed, throughout the U.S.-Israeli relationship, there has been a lot of the tail wagging the dog. Israel has been good at playing American politics. And so it is hard to put the kind of pressure on Israel that the objective facts would suggest the U.S. should be able to wield. After all, Israel is by far the biggest recipient of U.S. foreign aid. And the U.S. has stood with Israel firmly for a very long time. So to that extent, it is a bit humiliating that all that apparent influence doesn’t get listened to.Q: Is Israel, as you say, “very good at this” because they they live in a rough neighborhood, or because of the pressure domestic politics plays on Biden? What gives them the power to do this?A: Surely it is partly the rough neighborhood – Israelis certainly see themselves as living in a very rough neighborhood. So the typical pattern is the U.S. says “go easier.” Israel says “give us a few more days.” That was the pattern in 2006 and has been the pattern this time – Israel asks for a little bit more time to accomplish its military objective. But if its ability to ignore U.S. demands stems primarily from living in a rough neighborhood, Israel does have a lot of influence in the United States. Majorities in both parties in Congress support Israel, though there is increasing dissent over that support on college campuses and elsewhere. In a recent Pew poll, four times as many Democrats as Republicans in the U.S. thought Israel was going too far in its military operation.Q: Biden recently said Israel is “losing support” over the war and its “indiscriminate bombing of Gaza.” Netanyahu said the Palestinian Authority will never run Gaza, despite U.S. support for that idea. What does this more open division tell us?A: It tells us that things are getting worse between the two countries for sure. It obviously reflects the frustration on Biden’s part and the administration’s part. It is a marker, I think, of how isolated Israel is now in global public opinion and is obviously taking the U.S. with it. So that’s a big source of frustration for the administration. It really is time for some kind of cease-fire again, and maybe another release of some hostages. But that doesn’t seem in the cards soon.Q: What are Biden’s options at this point? It sounds like you’re saying Biden doesn’t have much that he can do. And, in fact, it looks like within Israel, Netanyahu – whose government may fall once the war slows or ends – is using Biden’s disapproval to shore up his political standing with his right-wing supporters.A: Certainly, Netanyahu’s playing to the right makes the problem even harder for the Biden administration. Netanyahu’s problem is more his right flank than Washington. And so that makes it difficult for the U.S. to exert the kind of influence it should. And we still don’t have an understanding of what the Israeli sense of the endgame is. On the current track, they wind up, it seems, occupying Gaza. They surely don’t want to do that. My guess is behind the scenes the Israelis are thinking about some option involving the Palestinian Authority, even though Israel says it wants no part of that.Biden went to a fundraiser the other day and told attendees that Netanyahu was the leader of “the most conservative government in Israel’s history” that “doesn’t want a two-state solution” to the Palestinian conflict. “I think he has to change, and with this government, this government in Israel is making it very difficult for him to move,” Biden said. When a president makes such a statement in a fundraiser, it’s not going to remain secret. What an extraordinary thing for a head of state to say about another government.It amounts in some sense to calling for regime change in Israel. We all assume that once the war is over, Netanyahu will be gone. But obviously if he has any thoughts of staying on, he does need to think about a different coalition. World opinion is going to force him to think seriously about the Palestinians, if not about a two-state solution. Whatever else has happened, Hamas certainly succeeded in its objective of getting the Palestinians’ desire for statehood back on the global agenda. And Netanyahu is going to have to deal with that at some point.Q: What are the elements that Biden has to consider as he manages this situation going into the future?A: He starts with generally strong American support for Israel that cuts across both parties. But the thing he needs to cope with is the increasing concern among progressives, especially young people in the Democratic Party, that there’s way too much suffering by the Palestinians, that something has to be done. And now it seems to me there’s almost a global consensus that this war needs to end. That’s the challenge that the administration faces: to try and heed that global consensus while letting Israel do the things it feels it needs to do in Gaza.And that’s really an impossible circle for Biden to square. President Lyndon Johnson used to say that sometimes being president was like being a mule in a hailstorm. “There’s nothing to do but to stand there and take it,” he said."

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_49,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°It’s a rare issue that can bring 41 states together for a bipartisan fight. This week, state attorneys general across the political spectrum joined forces in suing Facebook parent company Meta for allegedly using features on Instagram and other platforms that hook young users, while denying or downplaying the risks to their mental health.This comes two years after states began investigating Meta following revelations that the company’s internal research found Instagram was having a negative effect on some teen users’ mental health. Since then health professionals, including Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and the American Psychological Association, have urged tech companies to make their products safer for young people.But there hasn’t yet been significant change in the industry. Most companies haven’t been willing to overhaul their platforms to curb addictive features or harmful content for users under 18 years old.In the absence of policy changes, lawsuits are the next logical step in prodding technology companies to ensure their products are safe for young people or be held accountable. Some have compared the states’ legal strategy to lawsuits against Big Tobacco and opioid manufacturers that revealed how the companies lied about the harm caused by their products, and forced them to change their business practices.The federal complaint alleges Meta used harmful and “psychologically manipulative product features,” such as “likes,” infinite scroll and constant alerts, to hook young people on Instagram and Facebook and keep them engaged for as much time as possible in order to boost profits. Despite knowing that young users’ brains are particularly vulnerable to manipulation by such features and internal studies warning that kids were being harmed, Meta allegedly concealed, denied and downplayed the harms.The lawsuit, which was filed jointly by 33 states,also accused Meta of violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law that protects the digital privacy of children under 13 years old.Meta said in a statement that it has already rolled out 30 tools to support teens on its apps since 2021, including reminders on Instagram for teens to take a break and sharing expert resources if kids search for posts on suicide or eating disorders.That’s a good start.The company lamented that the states chose to sue rather than work with tech firms “across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards.”Indeed, there is a need for comprehensive safety standards across social media platforms. But a tech lobbying group of which Meta is a member has sued to stop an effort by California, which passed a first-in-the-nation law last year requiring age-appropriate design and child privacy protection. The law was recently put on hold by a federal judge citing First Amendment concerns. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed an appeal.This is complex legal and regulatory terrain, and the states’ lawsuits are not a sure bet given existing laws that protect online platform companies from being held liable for content posted by users on their sites.Nor will any of these cases be resolved quickly.That’s OK.

We know that their good intentions and noble deeds have made America “the land of the free” and deader of the free world. Through their ultimate sacrifices, we are all beneficiaries to the peace, freedom, democracy and liberty they’ve been fighting and dying for.As we gather together in churches and cemeteries to offer our prayers and lay flowers for our departed loved ones, let’s also reflect on the many contributions our soldiers have made to our great nation.On this Memorial Day, let’s pause for a few moments to honor, salute, pay tribute and give thanks to our fine men and women in uniform who have served us, and paid the ultimate price/sacrifice — their precious life — for our sake. To them, we say, “may your legacy live on and on…”I’d like to share with you my poem, “In Loving Memory,” which I humbly dedicate to our armed forces personnel who lost their lives in the war on terrorism, fighting for freedom and peace throughout the world:“With hope and valor, you fought for freedom | Without fear and reservation, you shed tears and blood To the end… | Committed to defend your country, your home You fought decisively… | Struggled hard to win victory | With so much pain, sacrifice and suffering | In the service to humanity, you left us a legacy | To cherish and to uphold | That love for one’s country is worth-dying for!“Gone, but not forgotten, yet honored and remembered | Today, yesterday, and forever — | You the unsung heroes | The freedom lovers and fighters | The peacemakers and peacekeepers… | You will always be our ideal and inspiration | For a better life-world | Where there’s love and unity | Peace and brotherhood among humankind.”May the souls of our beloved departed veterans, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_165,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°America’s high schools face a growing crisis: Millions of students who entered ninth grade in the fall of 2020, at the height of the pandemic, are set to graduate this spring, with little hope of recovering from the learning loss incurred while schools were shut. Simply put, they’re running out of time. Since the start of the pandemic, the academic performance of high school students has been abysmal. In 2022, average scores on the ACT exam were the lowest in 30 years; this year’s results were even worse. Barely 20% of students met college-readiness benchmarks in all four areas tested — English, math, reading and science — and 43% met none, up from 35% in 2018. Other data show broad declines in reading and math proficiency, while the number of students receiving failing grades has soared. In Houston, the country’s eighth-largest public school district, as many as half of high school students have flunked at least one course since the start of the pandemic, compared to one-third in 2019.Absent alternatives, these students will leave school unprepared for either college or the workforce — greatly increasing their risks of unemployment, poverty, depression and even early death. District officials have a responsibility to address the catastrophic damage caused by school closures pushed by teachers unions and their political allies.In a functional system, underperforming students would be held back until they demonstrated command of their course material. Instead, schools are doing the opposite. Nationwide, high school graduation rates have recovered from an early pandemic dip, with some districts reporting record numbers of graduates despite little evidence of achievement gains. Only eight states require seniors to pass a test of basic skills to earn their diploma, down from 25 a decade ago, and three of the holdouts — New Jersey, Massachusetts and New York — are considering proposals to scrap them. This lack of accountability is a big reason why nearly 38% of college students fail to finish their degrees within six years, and 45% of community college students drop out altogether.Preventing irreversible damage for older students will require a tougher approach. High schools should start by being candid with parents about where their kids stand and the work necessary to meet end-of-year benchmarks. They should make clear that chronic absences — which have soared since the pandemic, most acutely among high schoolers — will affect students’ ability to graduate on time. States should push districts to require that, at a minimum, graduating seniors be tested on their proficiency in core subjects to receive a diploma.Schools should identify those who fail to meet basic standards. But simply forcing scores of 18-year-olds to spend another year in high school is likely to do them more harm than good, while straining limited resources. Better to give current seniors the option of spending a postgraduation gap year completing high school coursework while taking introductory college classes or starting apprenticeships with local employers. Schools also should work with community colleges, which have seen an 18% drop in enrollment since 2019, to create dedicated academic recovery centers that would help students establish a foundation for postsecondary success.Extending free education beyond 12th grade won’t be cheap — yet as much as $90 billion in federal pandemic aid to schools remains unspent. The most urgent priority is to use those funds to help high school students recover what they’ve lost, before it’s too late.— Bloomberg/TNS"
suffolknewsherald_2023_63,"Published 5:31 pm Tuesday, April 25, 2023ByJen Jaqua1955 and ’56 were filled with turmoil as well as advances in civil rights and medicine.In early 1954, the first full-scale thermonuclear explosion in history was performed. This was announced as the first step in the hydrogen weapon program for the United States. Unofficial reports described the blast as wiping out an island. According to a story in February 1955, the hydrogen bomb can kill 140 miles from detonation. Many stories over the following months cited the opinion that any future war would be an atomic one. Beginning in the summer of 1955, nationwide atomic attack drills were held to educate the public about safety procedures in the event of an attack.One drill practiced the emptying of the Pentagon. The plan, as detailed in a June 1 story, was that all employees would exit to the parking lot, typically filled with about 9,000 cars. They would then load up the cars, providing rides for those who use the bus to get to work, and drive out of the city. The story cites traffic control plans to move the 9,000 cars out of the city without traffic jams.On May 17, 1954, a Supreme Court decision outlawed segregation in public schools. Chief Justice Warren read the court’s opinion, which declared: “We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of separate but equal has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.”In June 1955, the Supreme Court unanimously declined to fix a definite deadline or order any national procedures for ending segregation in 21 states practicing segregation in some or all of their schools. They called instead for “prompt and reasonable start.” And they said “primary responsibility” rests with state and local school officials to solve the delicate problem. Court battles continued through the end of 1955.On June 15, 1955, Mayor Richard L. Woodward Jr. announced that he would resign as mayor and councilman of Suffolk because, he said, he “will not serve on the same City Council with a woman.” He clarified his statement by saying that his action was not directed to Mrs. Laura Elmore, the woman who was elected to the council that week, or to any other particular woman. Instead, he said, it was directed to “the entire feminine element in general,” and added that he was of the opinion that there was no woman in the city who had the capabilities and business experience that he believed was necessary to serve on the City Council.As the polio vaccine was questioned and studied by medical boards, new versions were released. It was reported that the vaccine would not be withheld from any child due to financial hardship. In 1954 field trials, the Salk polio vaccine was about as good as that for whooping cough, a Public Health Service doctor said. It isn’t quite as effective as smallpox vaccine and diphtheria toxoid. But Dr. Joseph Bell, who made the comparison, hastened to add that “this is the first polio vaccine and we can expect that an improved vaccine will eventually be developed.”On the entertainment side of the news, in early 1955 funds were raised to build a public swimming pool near downtown Suffolk. Business and community organizations raised money, as did school children. The children held a march and spare change fund at all the local schools. “If you are old enough to walk, you are old enough to swim,” one story stated. The News-Herald also assisted in collecting donations and listed those on the front page. The pool opened Sept. 3. Although the weather was rainy and at times there was heavy downpour, a couple hundred children dodged the showers to swim the first day.While most international news centered on the wars in China or the threat of the Soviet Union, one story was published of a different nature.“A gaunt, snarling lad dubbed ‘wolf boy’ is providing medical authorities in Lucknow with twin problems of keeping him alive and determining his background. Tho doctors said today the boy, who walks on all fours, eats only raw meat and laps water like an animal, is 9 years old. With his hair long and matted, he was found mysteriously in a railway freight car. Though definitely a human, doctors conjecture that he was reared by animals. Despite more than two weeks of hospital care, however, he still lies huddled weakly in his body, giving an occasional snarl and trying to bite attendants. He cringes from light. He shows little interest in his surroundings until raw meat is produced. This he devours avidly.”Jen Jaquais the creative director for the Suffolk News-Herald.

eugeneweekly_2023_69,"We ve got issues. I went to Portugal on a Measure 110 fact finding tour. I was one of three people going from Lane County: State Sen. Floyd Prozanski, Paul Solomon of Sponsors, and me representing one of three of Lane County’s Measure 110-funded Behavioral Health Resource Networks, which are composed of frontline, both new and established, low-barrier, harm reduction and outpatient treatment providers. In addition, I represented substance use disorder providers of color, who also went to Portugal. There have been long standing health disparities in practices: White people get treatment, Black people get jail and no treatment for the same substance use symptoms. People “self-medicate” their traumas using substances, because they can’t access therapy. People of color, correctly raising issues around racialized trauma in treatment, were routinely discharged for “non-compliance” or raising “non-recovery, outside issues.” Measure 110 addresses this by directing funding services to populations most affected by the “War on Drugs.” I was interested in how Portugal addressed racial disparities as well. Portugal’s move to decriminalize possession of small amounts for personal use, and seeing all people with addictions as patients, rather than criminals, was driven by family members of prominent citizens fatally overdosing. Certainly, a situation that existed in Oregon for my entire career here. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Forty years ago I moved from Los Angeles to train the addictions workforce for the state. In one Drug 101 (Basic Pharmacology training, the son of a former high state official was nodding off in the training from heroin, not boredom. I was told, while he was kept away from clients, he was allowed to be employed as a personal favor. Officers of the court in Eugene have wrecked government vehicles under the influence, one even requiring a breathalyzer to start the vehicle while on the job. In Portland, even though police videotaped inner city drug transactions involving white suburban buyers, they only arrest the Black drug dealers, not the buyers who are also breaking the law. The common thread, of course, is money and race. When Nancy Reagan was saying “Just Say No,” 80 percent of illegal drug users were white males making in excess of $50,000 in income. White women, another 13 percent. Seven percent were ethnic minorities, 3 percent of them Black. Guess who was doing jail time? Today, according to Columbia University researcher Carl Hart, there are currently 30 million illegal drug users, largely employed and housed, with over 353,000 in prison for their substance use disorder related crimes. The Wars on Drugs (over 270 years of them, nearly three centuries old have never been waged against the majority of problem substance users. Wealthy white drug use has always enjoyed de facto decriminalization. A modern trauma-informed, evidence-based — or community defined evidence-based (racial, sexual intersectional trauma — patient-centered medical approach is more effective. When Portugal passed its decriminalization package in 2000, decriminalization was but one of nearly 70 policy solutions proposed and implemented to address the addiction crisis. Portugal’s decriminalization program also included extensive public health resources to educate the population around prevention, and to engage people with addictions with necessary services, including harm reduction, treatment, shelters, employment, prevention and recovery support education. They showed reduction in key indicators after five years of continuous efforts, including 90 percent reductions in viral infections such as HIV, HBV and HCV. By comparison, Measure 110 implements a handful of the 70 Portuguese reforms, many of the harm reduction elements were in practice before. The problems are far larger than what legal cannabis money can address. Using only legal cannabis funding, while legal tobacco, alcohol, pharmaceuticals — as well as illegal drugs, not to mention gambling and cyber addiction — compounds the problems. Major portions of the American gross domestic product are devoted to promoting addictive products and services, as compared to the public health infrastructure attempting to reduce addiction related problems. Ethnic minorities who were untreated and incarcerated for addiction related crimes are receiving 110-funded housing, treatment and employment readiness, after long being neglected. That’s a harm reduction policy success. Harm reduction is not simply needle exchange, naloxone distribution and overdose reversals; it’s also making the system less toxic and more medically responsive. Those who claim that Measure 110 is a failure, after 1.5 years of funding, obviously neither talk to minority individual and program success stories, nor understand that medical science-based efforts take time to succeed. Almost 300 years of drug wars have failed. Now there are calls in Oregon for recriminalization, driven by public drug use, and for diverting and distributing scarce 110 funds to counties and cities whose deliberate neglect has historically contributed to the health disparities. The Portuguese infrastructure does utilize non-governmental organizations and first responders in education and ways we don’t here, but could. There are opportunities to improve on the Portuguese model, using traditions and innovations native to this continent. Let us stay and expand the harm reduction course."
leoweekly_2023_80,"The following is an excerpt from “Consent Is ____: The Things They Didn’t Teach in Sex Ed,” a forthcoming book by LEO columnist James Wilkerson that will be published by Nanny Goat Press on Jan. 16. It will run for $16.99.One general misconception about express consent is that it ruins the mood. There are some that think that if you’re in the throes of passions, asking for permission will be a complete turnoff, snapping their partner out of their romantic haze and back to reality. I personally have never known this to be the case, but because I love some good old fashioned empirical research, I polled 20 women asking them, “if you were about to hook up with a guy and he verbally asked for consent, would that alter your mood in anyway?” 19 of the 20 all stated that being asked for consent would not turn them off (the one respondent that didn’t answer “no” stated that as she has never been asked for consent before, she wasn’t quite sure how she would react. Let that sink in .Several respondents elaborated on their answer, stating that verbally asking for consent conveys an overall theme of respect. One respondent said, “it shows respect and also eliminates the dangers of making assumptions.” Another similarly stated, “I would feel it was respectful and would prefer it. It means he actually appreciates me as a human, much more than a man who just assumes.” A third respondent simply stated that it “shows kindness.”Another thing the survey revealed is that express consent need not be awkward. In fact, you’re better off if it isn’t. 35% of the women in the survey stated the way in which the consent was asked for needed to be right. One respondent stated that verbally asking for consent wouldn’t alter her mood, as long as it wasn’t asked for in a “creepy way” while another respondent stated it needs to be done “tactfully.” One respondent even stated that verbally asking for consent could even positively alter her mood “depending on the delivery.” Perhaps that is what some men are worried about: the delivery. The angel on your left shoulder says, “just ask” while the devil on your right says, “you might screw it up.” One thing about asking for consent I’ve come to realize though, is that asking for it doesn’t have to be a huge production. In my day, the phrase “is this cool?” was usually enough to let me know whether in fact it was “cool” or not. The answer was either “sure” or “nah.”As one respondent states “you don’t have to go too far with the asking. Asking ‘is this okay’ or ‘are you sure’ is not a turn off.”You want to know what would be a huge turnoff though? One joke (well… I think it’s a joke that I hear from time to time is, “I’ll just have her sign a contract.” To which I say, “look, if you are able to get someone to sign a legal document right before they have sex with you, then your game is far better than mine!” When they say, “try not to make it awkward”, I think this is what they are talking about. I know Dave Chappelle may have famously gotten his partner to sign the “love contract” in a skit on his legendary TV show, but I would imagine producing pre-arranged documentation affixed to a clipboard from your nightstand in the real world would probably be frowned upon. Stranger things have happened though.So, what of implied consent? In a guest lecture, about 5% of audience members will raise their hand to claim they would prefer implied consent over express. When asked why, typically the response is “it’s just more natural.” I can agree with that in some instances. For example, my wife and I pretty much have our romantic pattern down to a science. We have been together for a while and as such, know our parameters. That’s not to say that we always want what is in those parameters. But when we don’t, we know the other’s body language enough to know to stop and move on. When she responds to me whispering sweet nothings in her ear by rolling over and showing her back to me while pulling the quilt over her head, that’s pretty much my sign that it “ain’t happening” tonight. So, in an instance like that, implied works best for us. Even still, sometimes we have verbal conversations about our likes and dislikes with express consent always sneaking back into the fray.When discussing consent in a sterile environment like a classroom or through this book, it’s easy to see the obvious benefits of express consent and lean towards it as your choice. But if we catalog our past experiences, there is a good chance we’d see that a lot of our encounters involved implied consent. As I typically tell students, sometimes implied is appropriate. Other times express is fine. But neither? Well, when consent is totally absent, you have officially entered “catch a case territory.” And that is somewhere you don’t want to be. •Keep Louisville interesting and support LEO Weekly by subscribing to our newsletterhere.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_173,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°My new year’s resolution for 2024 was shaped by a random moment. I was coming out of the shower, full of thoughts about a novel I’m working on. I suddenly noticed seven small makeup bags, replete with sample giveaways that I’ve accumulated for way too long, tucked away in a corner.Then, I thought that I had many small corners in my life needing cleanup. I was looking at only one. “It’s time,” I told myself. “My novel and its characters will have to await their fate. Mine is happening right here and now.”And just like that, I was on my way to a new year’s resolution. In my fictional character’s world, “Alfred” would call it “a perfect twofer.” I would combine cleaning with a thoughtful resolution that serves a higher purpose.If my resolution were just about purging makeup, that would seem shallow. Instead, I decided to expand the concept of cleaning the small corners of my life to “creating space,” not just physical space.Who doesn’t need more space in their lives? Space to explore, space to be, space to accept. Space means simplicity. Space means honoring the essentials. And then, while cleaning my corner of pouches, I identified the most important space of all to preserve.The space to listen.This would be a continuance of a long-sought goal of mine to improve communication skills, only taking it one level higher. It’s beyond the need to interrupt less or not formulate your response while others are still making their point.Making the space to listen means suppressing a tendency to fill the space when a conversation goes silent. Since I am a good conversationalist, it’s not difficult for me to seamlessly interject something that fits. However, we lose something in the process.When we let the silence linger, we allow shy people to jump in. We think a little more before stating our views. We demonstrate humility by acknowledging that answers aren’t always quick or easy.At its core, respecting the silent moments is about adjusting our attitude of sharing what we know and learning from others. Bodies of research have shed light on the value of letting the silence linger. There is the so-called “Rule of Awkward Silence” for helping to build emotional intelligence, which goes …When faced with a challenging question, instead of answering, you pause and think deeply — for 5, 10, or even 15 seconds or more — about how you want to answer.The same researcher cites some of our most successful business leaders — think Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook — as practicing some version of the Rule of Awkward Silence.There is also a practice called “intentional silence,” where one holds one’s response for four seconds of thoughtful deliberation. Counting to four seems easy enough, but some habits would need changing for the speaker and the listener. I would need to abandon my practice of quick responses, a byproduct of growing up in a large family and wanting to get my words in. Listeners’ habits would also need changing in a world where attention spans are short and patience is shorter.This year’s resolution for respecting a lingering silence seems particularly important given the times. It is likely that 2024 will start like 2023 went out — filled with turmoil, angst and heightened sensitivities. Building a tolerance for the silent pause means there is a greater chance we will pick our words and cull our ideas more carefully, and we will give space for others to do the same. Or, as Winston Churchill once said, “We are masters of unsaid words, but slaves of those we let slip out.”I like my new goal of making space for silence. It started in the simplest of ways — taking a shower and noticing a pile — and will finish with an awareness of sanctifying a particular space. My new commitment to respect the silent pause in conversation is simple only on the surface. It might be my hardest resolution yet.When I get wobbly, I will think of 19th century poet Thomas Carlyle, who adapted the old Arabic proverb, “Speech is silver. Silence is golden,” and shortened it to, “Silence is golden.” What was true in the 19th century is true now, too.So, 2024, I am ready! But you might see me before you hear me.Jill Ebstein is the editor of the “At My Pace” series of books and the founder of Sized Right Marketing, a consulting firm.

The rezoning would allow for more than 200 homes, tripling traffic while keeping only ten-foot-wide, ditch-lined road lanes. The commission voted 5-3 to recommend approval, despite no one stating any specific benefits it would bring to Suffolk.The main beneficiaries would be the developer, a builder and a few realtors. A regional realtors association put out frantic messages beforehand trying to gather support for the rezoning.One letter stated that CARE4Suffolk doesn’t “want any more communities built in Suffolk,” which is untrue. It also said that this “means that you and I would not have homes to sell” and it would make homes “unaffordable for our young families.”There are several problems with these messages:They were an overdramatic attempt to rally realtors from the entire region against concerned local residents.They were misleading. The author didn’t share that the Fiscal Impact Study for the proposed development shows the homes selling for $500,000. Is that truly affordable? She also mentioned “development zones” that include “farmland where there is already water and sewer,” despite Lake Kilby Road not having these utilities.They implied that it is the city’s responsibility to create inventory for realtors to sell. One letter states they need “rezoning of these parcels in order to have homes to sell in our city” and another says they are “in danger of losing out on valuable housing growth in Suffolk.”The realtor association’s chairman spoke on the developer’s behalf, touting a concept called “Smart Growth,” but failed to describe how rezoning on Lake Kilby Road would actually fulfill any of the principles (see CARE4Suffolk.org .Along with the realtor organization, the developer brought another supporter who bizarrely accused those opposed to the rezoning of “xenophobia.” I hope the realtors and developer don’t truly support this baseless accusation.I understand why a realtors’ group might favor a rezoning, but it should do so in a more thoughtful manner.

eugeneweekly_2023_9,"We ve got issues. In the past few months there’s been huge interest, unsettling interest, in the arrival of chatbot technology, which seems in a position to replace most human symbolic capacities. The new artificial intelligence-based “machine learning” chatbots, beginning with ChatGPT, can write essays, scripts, novels, produce art, etc., with the push of a button. Who needs humans? High tech “advances” are swallowing us by leaps and bounds, apparently. Jobs have long been outsourced, made redundant by cheaper labor elsewhere. Now it is thinking itself that is being outsourced. Not that it is thinking itself that is at work here. Via algorithms and an almost unlimited amount of data information, millions of computations can draw on a vast available of inputs to assemble answers to many, many questions. Sometimes incorrect answers. It’s a highly sophisticated machine operation, not actual thinking. In 1950, math genius Alan Turing predicted that by the year 2000 the culture would be dominated by a resemblance to machines. Not, he pointed out, that the technology would’ve by that time evolved to human-like resemblance, but that people would be more machine-like. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. The appearance of the chatbots and their range of capacities contrasts with our decline. We now have worse health, mentally and physically, fewer skills, less autonomy. Faced with the Machine, we’re losing more ground. Little wonder that the new tech freaks us out, even to the point of existential panic. Deeper questions may be emerging, namely: Is the value or meaning of the entire symbolic culture up for grabs? Is it that symbolic culture maybe isn’t worth so much if it can be so easily replicated? Symbolizing is at the very foundation of civilization, as civilization is now crumbling on all fronts for all to see. The apocalypse is arriving, in tandem with the technology that is its embodiment. Apocalypse is a word that announces a revealing. So much is, in fact, being revealed, at the same time that the dominant culture works to keep the revealing from becoming a danger to its existence.

The food we ate was more than just a source of survival, but a source of celebration. A good meal was always a nice way to end a tough day or a way to cap off a great day. Growing up in a rural part of North Carolina, country staples were a huge part of my upbringing. Souse, chitterlings, scrapple and so many other parts of the pig are part of my common knowledge, not to mention tomato pudding, butter bean and candied yams.But, being raised by parents who sought out other foods to delight the palate, gave me a pretty broad understanding of what’s good to eat. My mother’s love of Asian cuisine and cooking from other cultures and my father’s love for proper preparation and quality ingredients, inadvertently trained me on the ways of preparing a proper meal. My dear mother passed away in March 2009 and I lost my dad in April 2022. So, I feel like the standards and palate they provided were one of the best gifts they’d left behind for me.So, when I saw the application for Fav Chef competition with Carla Hall, benefitting the James Beard Foundation, I saw my opportunity to share my family’s brand of good eatin’ to a voting community. Sharing the stories behind my love of food and cooking with everyone was a very rewarding and therapeutic experience. It kept the spark to create my kind of food going and I hope it inspired you all to appreciate the beautiful ceremony of preparing a meal.Now that my run in the race has ended, I could not be prouder of finishing in third place in my group. And, it is all thanks to the votes and support everyone showed me since the start of the competition. So, to all you Suffolkians who read about my entry in the competition in the Suffolk News-Herald and took my foodventure with me, I want to offer my sincere thank you. I had such an amazing time presenting my kitchen craft to those who followed me on Facebook and Instagram. Cooking has been so many things to me throughout my life. It’s been exciting. It’s been creative. It’s even been cathartic on a few occasions. I grew up in a home where it seemed like food was a loving calling card that drew us all back to a shared space to check in with one another.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_124,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°As world leaders gathered in Dubai for COP28 (the 2023 U.N. Climate Change Conference , animal advocates mobilized with a climate wake-up call: Not only does ditching meat, eggs and dairy save animals — it’s also the key to saving the world.Raising animals for food requires massive amounts of land, feed, energy and water. And by some estimates, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the world’s transportation systems combined. Although COP28 had a “mostly vegan” menu, that isn’t enough. World leaders must lead by example by making all future COP and U.N. events fully vegan and by going vegan themselves.Why would a conference about protecting the planet serve any foods that scientists have long warned cause great harm to the climate? That’s as hypocritical and counterproductive as the use of child labor at a conference on child protection.Perhaps it had something to do with the hordes of meat and dairy industry representatives who attended COP28.These industries know that the public is becoming aware of the impact of animal-based agriculture on greenhouse gas emissions, and they’re desperate to advance the interests of their filthy, methane-spewing factory farms.Fortunately, those who prioritize the planet over profit are determined to see the truth prevail. PETA’s stilt-walking “doughnuts” visited the Big Apple to hand out thousands of vegan doughnuts and urgent information about economist Kate Raworth’s “doughnut model” of economics.This environmental action calls for everyone to stop eating animal-derived foods to save animals’ lives and the world.The evidence is clear: Embracing vegan foods contributes to resource efficiency, mitigates the climate catastrophe and conserves biodiversity. The production of vegan foods results in fewer planet-heating emissions, less water pollution and less land destruction than that of animal-based foods. And vegan eating also reduces wildlife devastation by 66% and water use by 54%.A vegan food system could feed substantially more people than an animal-based one, which would help reduce food insecurity. Plus, the health benefits of vegan eating support overall well-being: Going vegan is associated with a lower risk of developing coronary heart disease, high blood pressure or diabetes, and it’s linked to increased longevity.But the battle extends far beyond the COP conference — it’s a clash between an archaic food system that helped get the world into this mess and a simple solution that can get it out.On one side, meat, egg and dairy promoters are pushing misinformation. On the other side, environmentalists, animal advocates and climate experts are armed with loads of evidence revealing that going vegan is the only responsible choice.Let’s hope world leaders listen to the truth.It’s already happening in some countries. The Danish government recently published a groundbreaking national action plan outlining how the country can transition toward a vegan-centered food system. It’s a compelling model for other nations — including the U.S.But we don’t have to wait for the government to act. Let’s go vegan now — for the planet and all its inhabitants."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_5,"In the name of national security, former South Carolina governor and current Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley wants to use government authority to ban anonymous speech on social media platforms. “Every person on social media should be verified by their name,” she told Fox News.No matter how many nefarious images of Russian or Chinese disinformation agents one conjures up, this is a no-good, very bad idea.Anonymous speech is a hallowed American tradition. It’s hardly an exaggeration to say that if it had never been permitted, the United States as we know it may never have existed. Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, secretly penned by John Dickinson, were instrumental in uniting colonists against British misrule. Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison published their stirring Federalist essays defending the proposed U.S. Constitution under the pseudonym “Publius.” Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson regularly penned missives without their real names attached.For good reason, the tradition has remained alive through the 21st century. In 2018, the New York Times published an op-ed from a then-anonymous official who proclaimed that “the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic.” Donald Trump, of course, said it was treason.One can question the wisdom of a newspaper choosing to shield the identity of an administration insider seeking to influence public policy without challenging the legal right to self-publish under a false name or no name at all. Anonymous and pseudonymous accounts proliferate on Reddit and on the platform once known as Twitter, often providing essential protection to whistleblowers and others worried about being fired, excoriated or even physically harmed.With respect to Haley, there’s an extra ironic twist here. Back in August 2022, someone in the office of New York Attorney General Tish James broke the law and leaked the tax returns of an advocacy group Haley founded called Stand for America. Politico published a story revealing donors’ identities, and hell hath no fury like the candidate whose big-money allies were exposed.“We are not going to throw cotton balls at them,” said Haley of the AG’s office. “We’re going to throw a grenade, and we’re going to make sure that they know enough is enough.”Her counterattack on “liberal harassment” is consistent with a long line of conservative legal thought that says the right to give anonymously to a political cause, even one closely aligned with a specific candidate, is sacred because forcing people to reveal their personal political commitments is to open them to harassment.It’s a fair point. Take, for instance, the successful 2008 campaign to bar same-sex marriage in California. Most donors were made public under law, and “victory has been soured by the ugly specter of intimidation,” reported the Times.In the irreconcilably inconsistent mind of Nikki Haley, it is unconscionable intimidation for government to out the names and contributions of multimillionaire contributors trying to influence the political process. But it’s a-OK for the same government to force everyday people who post on TikTok, Twitter/X, Instagram or other platforms to reveal their identities. Really?—New York Daily News"

philinquirer_2023_4,"In an illustrated op-ed, local artist Joe Boruchow crafted a paper cutout to help center our conversation around peaceful solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, I have been distressed at the unproductive clamor from both the far-left and the far-right. This was encapsulated perfectly in a clip that circulated among many of my friends on the activist left ofMarc Lamont Hill debating Donald Trump’s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, in which the two frequently shout over one another. In my mind, these two are opposite sides of the same coin, representing extreme views and trying to provoke emotional responses instead of proposing rational solutions. My paper cutout,2 People 2 States,is an attempt to bring the discussion to a place where peace may actually be achieved. It’s loosely based on the 1993 Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat handshake that marked the beginning of the Oslo Accords and an attempt at mediating a two-state peace between Israel and Palestine. The issue is very personal to me. One of my great uncles wasBer Borochov, a founder of the Labor Zionist movement, who believed Arabs and Jews could live together in working-class solidarity.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_24,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Iam pelted by wet snow as I climb above 8,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada of eastern California, tugging a sled loaded with batteries, bolts, wire and 40 pounds of sunflower seeds critical to our mountain chickadee research.At the research site, I duck under a tarp and open a laptop to program “smart” bird feeders for an upcoming experiment with fellow behavioral ecologist Vladimir Pravosudov.I have spent the past six years monitoring a population of mountain chickadees here, tracking their life cycles and, importantly, their memory, in a system Pravosudov established in 2013. The consistent record from this site has provided us with a unique window to observe how chickadees survive in extreme winter snowfall and to identify ecological patterns and changes.In recent history, intense winters are often followed by drought years here in the Sierra Nevada and in much of the U.S. West. This pattern has been identified as one of the unexpected symptoms of climate change, and its impact on the chickadees is providing an early warning of the disruptions ahead within these coniferous forest ecosystems.As my legs get colder and wetter in the mountain snow, a charming and chipper “ DEE DEE DEE” chimes down from a nearby tree. How is it that a bird weighing barely more than a few sheets of paper is more comfortable in this storm than I am?The answer comes down to the chickadees’ incredible spatial cognitive abilities.Cognition is how animals acquire, process, store and act on information from their environment. It is critical to many species but often subtle and difficult to measure in nonhuman animals.Chickadees are food-storing specialists that hide tens of thousands of individual food items throughout the forest under edges of tree bark, or even between pine needles, each fall. To survive, they use their specialized spatial memory to retrieve those food caches in the harsh winter months.We measure the spatial memory of chickadees by hanging a circular array of eight feeders equipped with radio-frequency identification and filled with seed in several locations across our field site.Birds are tagged with transponder tags in leg bands that contain individual identification numbers and allow them to open the doors of their assigned feeders to get a food reward — if they remember which feeder is theirs.Over eight years, our findings demonstrate that chickadees with better spatial memory ability are more likely to survive in the high mountains than those with worse memories.However, chickadees may be facing increasing challenges that will shape their future in the mountains.In 2017, a year with record-breaking snow levels, adult chickadees showed the lowest probability of survival ever measured at our site. This exceptionally extreme winter made it difficult for even the memory-savvy chickadees to forage and survive.Nevertheless, triumphant populations have persisted in high-elevation mountain environments, but their future is becoming uncertain.The Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges in western North America have been experiencing “weather whiplash” — more extreme snow years and drought years, amplified by climate change.In 2023’s record winter, over 17 feet of snow covered the landscape that our chickadees were using every day.The intense storms and cold temperatures not only made it difficult for birds to survive the winter, they made it almost impossible for the chickadees to breed the next summer: 46% of nests at our higher elevation site failed to produce any offspring.Even in years of tremendous snowfall, chickadees can still use their finely honed spatial memories to recover food. However, severe storms can shorten their survival odds. And if they do survive the winter, their nesting sites — tree cavities — may be buried under feet of snow in the spring.It doesn’t matter how smart you are if you can’t reach your nest.Extreme snow oscillations also affect insects that are critical for feeding chickadee chicks. Limited resources lead to smaller chickadee offspring that are less likely to survive high in the mountains.Snow cover is good for overwintering insects in most cases, as it provides an insulating blanket that saves them from dying during those freezing months. However, if the snow persists too long into the summer, insects can run out of energy and die before they can emerge, or they emerge after chickadees really need them. Drought years also can drive insect population decline.These compounded effects mean that in some years chickadees simply don’t successfully nest at all. This leads to a decline in chickadee populations in years with worse whiplash — drought followed by high snow on repeat — especially at high elevations. This is especially concerning, as many mountain-dwelling avian species are forecasted to move up in elevation to escape warming temperatures, which may turn out to be hazardous.Chickadees may be portrayed as radiating tranquil beauty on holiday cards, but realistically, these loud, round ruffians are tough survivors of harsh winter environments in northern latitudes.When the symptoms of climate change reach such extremes that they can’t make it, we should all take notice.Benjamin Sonnenberg is a PhD candidate in ecology, evolution and conservation biology at University of Nevada, Reno.

leoweekly_2023_43,"Sevenhorses died at Churchill Downs over the Kentucky Derby celebration weeks — a bloody marker for a historic event. Two of those horses died on Derby Day. The deaths of so many creatures piqued the public outcry against an industry that is flush with cash but struggling to make sense of itself in this day and age. Outside of Kentucky, what is horse racing, and does it still make sense to continue?I’m a Kentucky girl, born and raised, and there are so many parts of me that love to get swept into the excitement of the Derby events and even race day. Standing along the rail as the horses fly by your face is exhilarating. Horses are amazing creatures, and the thoroughbred is at the top of the pack in grace and athleticism.The dark side of this excitement is that, for our amusement, these animals are placed at risk and often meet terrible fates because of issues that could only, and would only, happen within the racing industry.Is it worth it?Ultimately, no. Horse racing cannot continue to subject these animals to conditions that cost them their lives, and put them at risk of injuries from which they cannot recover. After this past weekend, the conversation about horse safety has been magnified. Changes need to be made, and you can bet they will.But it’s not just horses who were taken from us this past weekend.Did you know that 17 people died in mass casualty events in Texas over the weekend? Nine on Saturday at a shopping mall shooting and another eight when someone drove a car into a crowd of people. I’m sure many families are struggling to make sense of these events.Which story will dominate the news cycle? Probably the atrocities in Texas, at least for a bit, until someone again mentions horses.Which issue will finally get some action? Also probably horses.We’ve seen time and time again that when humans kill humans, our government becomes lost in the litany of excuses they give us as to why they can’t change anything. Because for them, the dollars that line their pockets from gun lobbyists and other special interests are more valuable than anyone lost to these violent acts. There is no effort to make changes that will actually create protection for people.Certainly, with horses, the changes will still protect the moneyed interests of horse owners and industry players, but at least we’re likely to see noticeable changes for the good of the horses, if only to keep the money flowing.What about us?I’m not claiming that it is unfair for horses to get better care and treatment. For sure, I believe we’ve seen clear evidence over the last two weeks that what happens in the racing industry puts these creatures at great risk. What I would like to see is a level of movement and action to bring similar urgency to the violence done to people.It seems like an easy fix, but it won’t be. No matter how ugly the events in Texas, this isn’t the last time we’ll have this conversation. Certainly not in these pages.What is the solution when money’s purchasing power supersedes health, kindness, and the right to live?In Kentucky, racing is a part of our DNA. However, I think losing seven animals in such a short period makes it harder to keep cheering and betting money that’s covered in blood.Will we have the same reaction to the bloodshed in our streets, at our shopping malls, and outside our migrant centers?America seems to have a bloodthirst, be it for people or animals. We can’t get enough of cheering for sports, for weapons, and events that end with a body count. We let the blood keep spilling.•*** ."
eugeneweekly_2023_45,"We ve got issues. The remote-control device for one’s TV is a reminder of a wider and deeper web of technological mediation, of remoteness. The standard definition of “remote” is “at a distance,” as in operating at a distance, but also “separated.” The latter aspect may come into view when we think of a person who is remote –– that is, detached, emotionally distant, not connecting. What isn’t remote these days? More and more technology, at every level, in every sphere, and ever greater separation, disconnection. The exact opposite of tech’s promise of connection. The isolation and loneliness in the culture of modernity is now commonly recognized as no less than a public health crisis. Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995 was a philosopher of ethics who countered the remote with the supposedly transcendent value of a face-to-face relationship to the Other. He recognized people as related to each other, but also as “solitary and lost.” With a level of abstraction, however, that is basic to philosophy, Levinas offered nothing tangible to combat remoteness. He saw closeness to the natural world as having no importance; nature is “unethical.” Levinas likewise had no real interest in actual technological society and its results. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. In thesis 28 ofThe Society of the Spectacle, Guy Debord grasped that “isolation underpins technology, and technology isolates in turn.” Where’s the remote? Where isn’t remoteness? We are so distanced and separated from the non-remote. A prime example is found in what should be a bastion of intimacy and directness: health. Now it increasingly resides in “telemedicine,” “telehealth.” Norman Cousins’ Anatomy of an Illness (1979 warned of what has come to pass. Cousins cited Dr. Jerome Frank, who spoke of the remote, techno-approach and its deficiencies. He cited a 1974 British study showing that “the survival of patients with heart disease being treated in an intensive-care unit was no higher than the survival rate of similar patients being treated at home. His interpretation was that the emotional strain of being surrounded by emergency electronic gadgets… offsets any theoretical technological gain.” Also mentioned in Cousins’ book is an article by Dr. Robert Ryerson in theJournal of Clinical Psychology, where he cautioned against replacing the human touch with the mediation of machines. “A thorough physical examination fosters trust –– there is a laying on of hands and a listening attitude. The sufferer is being touched and understood.” Life need not be remote."
suffolknewsherald_2023_188,"Published 6:28 pm Saturday, September 23, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldTropical storms are formidable forces of nature that demand our utmost attention and preparedness. Many of us spent most of Friday watching the weather and hoping for some sort of pattern change. That change never occurred, and if it did, it was ever so slightly.Tropical Storm Ophelia’s predicted path led right through Virginia, prompting Gov. Glenn Youngkin to declare a state of emergency but not before Suffolk Public Schools took a proactive approach, calling for early dismissal from school Friday.While the storm may have passed by the time you read this, it provides us an opportunity to remind people of the importance of being prepared and staying up to date with weather forecasts.Here are some helpful tips to ensure your safety during severe weather;Stay Informed: Regularly monitor updates from reliable sources such as the National Weather Service or local news channels. Timely information can help you make informed decisions regarding evacuations and safety measures.Prepare an Emergency Kit: Assemble an emergency kit containing essential supplies like non-perishable food, water, flashlights, batteries, a first-aid kit, and important documents. Having this kit readily available can make a significant difference in times of crisis.Secure Your Home: Reinforce doors and windows, and consider using storm shutters or boarding up windows to prevent leaks and broken glass. Ensure your roof is in good condition to minimize damage.Evacuate When Necessary: If authorities issue evacuation orders, do not hesitate to leave. Your safety is paramount, and evacuation orders are issued to protect lives. Have a plan in place for where you will go and how you will get there .Stay Indoors During the Storm: Once the storm arrives, stay indoors, away from windows, and listen to local news for updates. Conditions can change rapidly, so be prepared to evacuate to a shelter if necessary.Post-Storm Caution: After the storm passes, avoid entering damaged buildings until local authorities deem them safe. Be mindful of downed power lines and flooded areas, which can conceal hazards.Community Support: Look out for your neighbors, particularly the elderly and those with special needs. Together, we can build resilient communities that recover quickly from tropical storms.It does not matter the weather source or what alert system you use, we simply ask that you find one and monitor the reports daily. Severe weather can happen at any moment. The best time to prepare is before it happens.In the face of tropical storms, preparedness and safety must always come first. Let us remember that it’s our collective responsibility to protect ourselves, our families, and our communities from the fury of these natural phenomena.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_59,"Published 5:36 pm Friday, April 28, 2023ByStaff ReportsWe picked up each bag in the grocery cart and placed them in the car until the cart was empty. “Would you, please, push the cart back,” I asked the 14-year-old with me. He replied: “My mom never returns them, and look,” he said motioning to carts scattered throughout the parking lot, “No one else returns them. Can’t we just leave it here?”“No.” I said, “Take it back.” He pushed the cart to the nearest return and walked back to the car. I began to explain why returning the cart was the right thing to do. I hoped that the explanation would allow him to understand why we returned the cart and provide some lessons that would expand beyond the grocery store.The first thing that returning the grocery cart teaches children is respect for the employees of the stores they visit. The carts do not return themselves, which means that someone must gather all the carts. That someone is an employee and taking a few extra steps to place the cart in a designated return area helps the employees gather them faster and easier. It’s a small request the store makes, and we should respect the workers at the stores we visit.Next, it teaches respect for others. Leaving a cart in the parking lot blocks parking spaces that others could use, and carts that are not secured may get caught in the wind and bump into someone’s vehicle. We wouldn’t want a space where we want to park to be blocked by a cart and we wouldn’t want our car to be damaged by a rolling cart, so we should do what we would want others to do for us. There’s something golden about that.It teaches, as well, to do the right thing even if there are no consequences for not doing so. There is no penalty for not pushing a cart back at the grocery store. The police won’t show up, there’s no financial penalty, and you won’t be banned from returning to the store. It’s a matter of integrity. Pushing the cart back reinforces that we should do the right thing no matter who is or who is not looking and regardless of the penalty or reward.Lastly, it teaches that respecting others and doing what is right is important even if others are not doing the same. We’ve all seen grocery carts scattered throughout parking lots. It may seem that “everyone else is doing it,” but we should never allow the actions of others to cause us to do something that we know is wrong.Returning a grocery cart may not seem like much, but our actions around things like this teaches our children a lot whether we verbalize it or not. They are watching, and they are learning. Explaining the reason why we push the cart to a designated return area is important, but the most important thing is to continually demonstrate a life of integrity and to guide them to do the same.Nathan Riceis a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

The time, day, month and year all aligned at 8:02 p.m. Written in military time and with numerals for the month and day, it worked out to 20:02, 02/20, 2002. “A mirror day like this is a good opportunity for reflecting,” said Mark Saltveit, editor of The Palindromist magazine.In June, two days of stormy weather prevented the crewmen of the International Space Station from being reunited with their families after a separation of 6-1/2 months. Mission Control told space shuttle Endeavour commander Kenneth Cockrell that drier weather was expected soon. A problem was brewing in orbit because of all the homecoming delays: The seven astronauts and cosmonauts were running short on coffee. Cockrell jokingly asked Mission Control if he could swing by the space station and get the extra coffee he left there for the three new residents.As the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks approached, the Bush administration raised the nationwide terror alert to its second-highest level, closed nine U.S. embassies overseas and heightened security at federal buildings and landmarks in America as new intelligence warned of car bombings, suicide attacks and other strikes linked to the anniversary. Americans were urged to be alert but unbowed — go to work, to school, on trips — despite specific threats against U.S. interests abroad and less credible concerns that terrorists might attack America again.In April of 2003, several local veterans said they felt like celebrating as they watched news broadcasts of the Iraqi people tearing down statues of Saddam Hussein in front of his Baghdad palace. They also want to thank the military men and women who seized the opulent palace and toppled a 40-foot sculpture of the Iraqi ruler, and they said they would gladly join in the fighting if Uncle Sam would have them as “Operation Iraqi Freedom” continued.In September 2003, a storm was making a beeline for Hampton Roads. The headline of the September 18 paper read, “Thousands flee hurricane; ruinous flooding possible.” The next day the headline was ‘SLAMMED.’“As the large eye of the weakened Hurricane Isabel moved in from the Outer Banks, Suffolk, along with other Hampton Roads cities, was hit hard. The city’s police, fire and rescue workers worked throughout the day and night, responding to multiple reports of downed trees and power lines throughout the city. A 7 p.m. curfew was put into effect in Suffolk Thursday. By 4 p.m. Thursday, flooding had closed portions of several major arteries in the downtown area, including Constance Road, North Main Street and Pitchkettle Road, said Dana Woodson, a city spokeswoman. Fallen trees left several dozen roads and streets across the city impassable, Woodson said. Isabel’s roaring winds — measured at 64 miles per hour by fire department officials at around 4 pm. — also knocked trees on at least 20 houses Thursday afternoon, she said.”Headlines in the following weeks detailed the damage. ‘What a mess!’ ‘70% of Suffolk is without water; 90% without power’ ‘Local damages in tens of millions’ ‘9 dead, 200 mile wide swath of destruction through Virginia’In the end, it was estimated the storm cost the city at least $715 million.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Unlimited immunity means that he would be totally above the law.Instead of the U.S. Constitution being the ultimate law of the land, Trump would be the law of the land.This will go down to the local level, where his lieutenants will run the show and have absolute power.Trump has demonstrated time and again that the only thing he cares about in those who support him is their total loyalty. The first time anyone disagrees with him, that person is branded as disloyal. Good luck if that is you.What Trump’s supporters also need to realize is that if you grant Trump unlimited immunity, then you also grant that to Joe Biden, and he’s going to be in office for at least the next 13 months.Russ ButtonPahoaA suggestion forunspent gift cardsUpon reading your front-page article, “The secret life of gift cards” (Dec. 26 , regarding unspent gift cards amounting to tens of millions of dollars, I had a thought.When purchasing a gift card, the buyer could register their name and pertinent information so that when a card is not used within the specified time period, the money could be returned to the card purchaser.Of course, the companies that benefit by people not using the free money a card provides will not go along with this idea voluntarily.

I know he loved my mother very deeply and still misses her and has found himself growing old with someone he initially didn’t intend to. The thing is, I don’t think he’s happy in his marriage. They don’t seem to have much in common or enjoy spending time together, and while he defends her behavior (excess drinking, ignorant remarks , I know he doesn’t agree with it. Part of me wants to talk to him about it, but I don’t know how. What do the cards say?-- Worried SonCards: The Sun (rev. , Three of Swords (rev. , Six of Swords, King of Cups (rev. Dear Son,I think there was a little light in your dad’s heart that went out when your mother died, and I don’t think it was ever relit. I think your mother was his Sun, the light of his life, a source of joy and wisdom, and when she left this world, he was devastated.With those Three of Swords reversed it does look like he’s still in mourning, even after all these years. If your mother had lived, they might have had one of those rare marriages that lasts 50, 60, 70 years—I don’t know. I’m so sorry they didn’t get the chance to try for that.The Six of Swords is a card that’s pulling double duty here. It is a card about holding onto the past and inertia, which suggests that your father’s broken heart keeps him from moving forward, whatever that looks like. The Six of Swords is also an uncomfortable time, and there is certainly a “grin and bear it” energy to it, so he might be committed to this second marriage, even if he’s not happy.And I agree with you: I don’t think he’s happy. He doesn’t sound that way from your question, and with the King of Cups reversed, I don’t think he’s the blissful bridegroom this time around. The Cup Court is a loyal bunch that takes the “for better or worse” part of marriage vows seriously. I think he is trying to honor his commitment and will defend his wife (even if her behavior is undesirable , but I don’t think he’s joyful about it.Now, none of this is to say that he does not love his second wife or never loved her. As I’ve written before, people get married for all sorts of reasons, and true love is only one of them. His second marriage might have been based on a love formed by companionship and respect rather than romance—again, I don’t know.I also don’t know if it would feel worse to be married to someone whose company you don’t enjoy or to age and die alone. As a 33-year-old, I know what I’d choose, but I might feel differently at 83.I do think it’s worth talking to your dad—but not in a judgmental, “you made a mistake with this marriage” sort of way. I think you need to be very delicate in your approach.Since the root of this seems to be his grief about your mother, you might try to talk about your feelings or memories of her. It’s a loss you both share. That might open the door for him to talk about his current feelings. But, if your dad wants to keep that door shut (and he might , you can simply tell him that you love him and you want him to be happy.

But how do I tell my CEO I think she’s wrong?--Bucking Against the BossCards: Last Quarter, New Moon, Queen of Pentacles (rev. , Death (rev. Dear BAB,You might try to raise your valid concerns with your boss, but I don’t think it will do anything for you. I rarely get moon cards, but here I have two: the Last quarter, signaling that things are out of control and you need to let go, and the generative idea of space of the New Moon.In that generative space, your CEO, aka Queen of Pentacles, got the idea that this candidate is THE one to deliver. I don’t know why she decided that, but I don’t think you’re going to talk her out of it.There might be a couple of reasons why the Death card is lurking at the end here. The first could be that to bump up against the CEO would mean you would be the ax (or scythe and be out of a job. Or, it might mean that you hire this very wrong candidate, and in six months, when they’ve proven to be a bad fit, you’ll fire them, and hopefully, your CEO will send them off with a severance package they’re obsessed with.Like all my advice for the corporate world, I would get your thoughts down in writing, explicitly outlining your concerns about the candidate (lack of experience? Abrasive communication style? and how you think other candidates should be considered. If anyone else was in on the interview and agrees with you, get them to put it down, too. Send it up the chain so higher-ups/the CEO see your objections. If they hire them and those red flags from the interview come up while they’re working, document those too.Hopefully, though, the Death card just signals the end of their candidacy, the CEO backs off, and you hire someone you think is qualified for your team.

The participants came from various parishes to experience the joy of encountering God and/with others. As expected, they were thankful and happy to see for themselves for the first time His Holiness, Pope Francis, who leads the Catholic Church.By the way, Guinness World Records recognized the 1995 World Youth Day event at the Luneta Park in Manila, Philippines as the largest crowd, with attendance of 5 million.Organized by the Catholic Church, World Youth Day is an event for young people around the world and was initiated by Pope John Paul II in 1985. It’s open to all young people (Catholics and non-Catholics , who desire to participate in a festive but spiritual encounter centered on Jesus Christ together with their peers. The traditional theme is usually unity among the presence of different cultures. WYD is celebrated annually at the diocesan level. Internationally, it is held every three years. Widely anticipated tradition in WYD is the public appearance of the Pope or Holy Father or Supreme Pontiff in a “Popemobile.” He, along with Cardinals, Bishops and other priests, leads the pilgrims in prayers and Eucharistic adoration (of the Blessed Sacrament .At the World Youth Day, pilgrims from around the world gather together to attend to and participate in church traditions of prayers, praying the Holy Rosary, attending Masses, singing Catholic-theme songs, and listening to inspiring testimonies, messages and talks.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_73,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°When a ship deploys from Hampton Roads, a part of the region goes with it. It carries our hopes for the mission’s success and our fervent desire to see all our brave men and women in uniform return home safely.Those emotions were heightened this weekend as the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the supporting ships in its strike group began their journey to the Mediterranean Sea amid an escalating conflict in the Middle East.The Eisenhower will join the USS Gerald Ford strike group, which was already in the Mediterranean but was repositioned following a brutal surprise attack by Hamas on Oct. 7. The terrorist organization, which has been the de facto authority in Gaza since 2005, launched hundreds of rockets into Israel as its fighters swarmed into countryside communities, killing an estimated 1,200 civilians and wounding more than 3,000 others. Hamas also abducted nearly 200 people, who are still being held in Gaza.The State Department says 30 Americans are among the dead and that 13 others are not accounted for, meaning they could be among the hostages held by Hamas.Israel has responded with airstrikes and limited ground operations that have killed 1,900 Palestinians and wounded nearly 7,700 others. International aid groups have warned of an unfolding humanitarian disaster following Israel’s decision to cut off supplies of power, water, food and fuel from Gaza.As Israel steps up its response, the presence of U.S. forces is meant to show support and act as a deterrent to other nations hostile to the Jewish state. But any deployment comes with some measure of risk, and this is a perilous moment. There’s a likelihood more violence will follow.Moving two carriers to the eastern Mediterranean underscores the gravity of the situation and the potential for a larger regional conflict. It puts the United States in a precarious spot, wanting to back a trusted ally in its time of need while preventing a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.President Joe Biden struck the proper tone in his interview Sunday night with CBS News’ “60 Minutes.” He pledged unwavering support of Israel as it seeks to eradicate Hamas and hold Hezbollah, another terrorist group in southern Lebanon that has fired rockets into Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, in check. But he also voiced the need to protect the lives of Palestinian civilians as Israel conducts those operations.The president urged the establishment of safe corridors for evacuations, the need to provide aid — food, water, medicine — to the displaced and to honor the rules of war, which require efforts to limit civilian casualties. He also cautioned against Israel reoccupying Gaza as it seeks to neutralize Hamas as a viable force in a strip of land slightly larger in area than the city of Hampton.The question is, or should be, how to find a workable solution to this intractable problem. Hamas, through its brutality, has done irreparable harm to the prospects of peace and dimmed hopes for a two-state solution, at least in the short term. And worrisome for Israel is that a ground campaign, which its forces appear poised to launch, could be a prolonged, intractable conflict that will kill scores of people on both sides, whatever pains are taken to reduce civilian losses.Eliminating Hamas is a must, as is securing the safe return of hostages held by the fanatics. But ordering the relocation of 1.1 million, as Israel did last week, or cutting off food, fuel and medicine from Gaza risks creating a calamity that could inflict agony on Palestinians who similarly detest living under the thumb of extremists bent on violence.That’s why, as more than 5,000 personnel waved goodbye to their families in Hampton Roads this weekend, our hearts and our hopes sailed with them into the Atlantic. May the shared humanity of all those who want to live in peace and safety find a way to shine through so much darkness.— The Virginian-PilotNEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

eugeneweekly_2023_12,"We ve got issues. For the past seven years, my husband and I have walked in Bethel’s Golden Gardens Park and observed the flora and fauna living there, including the proposed threatened Western pond turtle. I am a lifelong naturalist, professional scientist and educator. I think most people are aware of the problem of plastics in our environment. To consciously add that to the soil is a decision to pollute the soil and water for centuries. And that says nothing of the footprint of the production of artificial turf — even if outsourced outside of Eugene. The soil beneath the AstroTurf will no longer support life. When time is up and the artificial turf field gives way to something else, there will no longer be life in the soil to help anything living become established; therefore, more money will be needed to rectify the problem. The impact of plastics on wildlife is well known. Studies that specify buffer widths are limited and highly variable between environments. The preferable way to conduct these studies on this question at Golden Gardens is through landscape-scale planning, with special consideration of the channels in and out of the ponds and connectedness to other natural spaces. Has this been done for the project? Five hundred feet is barely a start for ensuring long-term health of the area. I note that when we first moved here, I had zero to few birds and fewer insects still for almost two years until I built back up, with native species, the postage-stamp-sized yard that I own. This speaks to the already depauperate environment — as scientists call an environment lacking in variety — that is the Barger Street area. Last year, I was thrilled to see a Townsend’s warbler at my suet feeder. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Over the course of my employer’s history, we have contributed to the recovery of three endangered/threatened species. I am involved in bringing back a critically endangered butterfly to the Willamette Valley. I know because I work on budgets: Helping endangered species recover takes millions of dollars and groups of organizations working together for a single species. It is far cheaper to do the right thing to begin with, before populations dwindle. Northwestern pond turtles have low genetic diversity. If we lose them from the park, resiliency, or the ability to resist extinction from stochastic events, of the entire species is significantly lowered. Every single place where the turtle occurs is important for its longevity in our shared future. Will a 500-foot buffer be enough to ensure the migration of the species between aquatic and upland environments? What about a study defining their movement across the landscape before work is done? Am I arguing against a sports park to save a single species? Yes and no. Yes, because I understand how difficult it is to recover a species once it is on the path to becoming endangered. And this one is in “proposed threatened status” by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the government agency charged with the study and recovery of endangered and threatened species. No, because as a biologist, I know that species don’t exist alone in ecosystems. The entire system functions only because it does so together through time and coevolutionary processes that drive intimate, hard-to-recover functioning relationships. If the development proceeds, the park will also lose many of its other-than-human residents and visitors. I’ve watched for almost a decade a mated pair of bald eagles make the park their home. As activities, lighting, and noise increase and food supplies dwindle, they will move on. The herons, egrets, red-winged blackbirds, cormorants, coots, buffleheads, mergansers, cackling geese, otters and many others will become fewer in number and visit much less often. As a naturalist, I can’t abide its destruction. Teamwork, life and problem-solving skills, often mentioned as the benefit to sports, can be taught through nature. This option is far less costly, builds on an existing ethos, is more widely impactful and is meaningful across the community into the future. Golden Gardens is already shining gold surrounding an Emerald City; it’s just waiting for you all to figure that out. I hope it isn’t too late. I’ll help you polish it."

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_65,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°Ask any parent about the time their kids spend on mobile devices, and you’ll likely hear the same refrain: It’s too much. Excessive use of smartphones and social media is linked to rising rates of teenage depression and self-harm, while also damaging students’ academic performance and exacerbating achievement gaps. At this point, the question isn’t whether phones should be banned from classrooms, but why more schools haven’t done so already.Evidence about the negative effects of mobile devices on learning is overwhelming. Large-scale international assessments have shown that anything beyond limited use of technology in the classroom harms academic performance. A 14-country study cited in a U.N. report this year found that merely being in proximity to smartphones disrupted learning for all ages, from preschool to college, with poorly performing students suffering the most.Prompted by findings like these — and common sense — the British government announced this month that it will instruct schools to prohibit the use of mobile phones during the school day. Other European countries, including the Netherlands and France, have imposed similar bans. Such policies can be challenging to enforce, but in places that have followed through the gains have been striking. Bans on phones in two regions in Spain improved math test scores by the equivalent of more than half a year’s learning.A 2022 analysis of more than 100 Norwegian middle schools found that banning phones boosted students’ grades and test scores and increased their likelihood of attending an advanced high school. It also yielded bigger academic improvements than far more expensive policies, such as reducing class sizes or putting more computers in schools.Despite these clear benefits, U.S. schools seem to be moving in the wrong direction. As of 2020, 76% of public schools said that they prohibited the “non-academic” use of phones during school hours, down from more than 90% a decade earlier. By all indications, those restrictions are widely flouted. In response to a surge in smartphone use during the pandemic — fueled partly by misguided school closures — some districts appear to have abandoned even token efforts to keep devices out of kids’ hands. A survey released last month found that 97% of US adolescents say they use their devices during the school day, for a median of 43 minutes.State legislatures should press schools to ban the use of phones for the duration of the school day, including during passing periods and recesses — and to confiscate them, if necessary. They should provide incentives to districts that demonstrate academic gains after imposing school-wide bans. They should also help schools pay for things like electronics-storage pouches and phone lockers.Schools will no doubt get an earful from parents who oppose such bans. While acknowledging legitimate anxieties — such as how to reach a student during a crisis — they should hold firm and explain that emergency-contact protocols are more than sufficient.It’s by now incontrovertible that, however essential to modern life, smartphones have no place in the classroom. The sooner schools remove them, the better off students will be.— Bloomberg OpinionHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2023_126,"Published 4:36 pm Tuesday, February 14, 2023ByStaff ReportsWith all the blessings God has given us shouldn’t we make every day, every month special by thanking him? But we don’t. We think we did it all by ourselves. Shame on us. But at least we make one day and one month of the year a time to shed around our thoughts of love.Here are some other things special about this month:February is the only month with 28 days — until leap year adds that extra day. You may have a reason to celebrate one of those days in February as a birthday or anniversary, but right in the middle is the day most everyone knows about and will celebrate — Valentine’s Day! It’s a day for expressing love, a God given human emotion and mostly happy day for sending cards, giving gifts and seeing red Valentine hearts advertising “love” of some kind, even if only candy, especially chocolate candy. It’s a day some young couples choose to get engaged.All in all, it’s a day when much of the world pauses to recognize there is a need to “love one another.”Where did that idea come from? In such a world as we live in today, we know it came from a greater source than ourselves. We are all influenced by our emotions and they are erratic and sometimes shattered by what is taking place at that moment in our own lives. The arch enemy of God is hard at work and we are allowing him to rule our lives.In II Chronicles 30 in the Bible we find reference to the second month and the 14th day as a time for celebrating Passover. Passover was the greatest reminder the God of love could let us know he loved us.Committing ourselves to God, asking his forgiveness for our sins and pleading with him to open the eyes of those who are evil that one day they will have to give an account to him.How do I know that? Because I have read and trusted his word, the Bible, since I was 16 years old and it has always proven true. It tells the story of how life began and will end. It’s the “source book” for life. He is God, the creator, the omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent one who did not abdicate. He is still in control but allows us to have our own way when we demand it.In all my years I have never believed we needed those expressions of love more than we do today. It seems all over the world there are those who have given over themselves to evil doings, some sickeningly terrible ones. An emphasis on love and smiles and a “thank you” should encourage all of us. Let’s hope everyone made Feb. 14 and then every day in 2023 a day when we express kindness everywhere we go and with everyone we meet.Feb. 25 will be a very special day this month for me.

(Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for National Urban League/TNS After collapsing in a Houston studio during a recording session last year, R&B star Al B. Sure wound up in a coma that lasted longer than some of his concert tours.For nearly three months, the hitmaker behind such classics as“Nite and Day” and‘Off on Your Own” was flat on his back, hooked up to a ventilator preparing for what could have been his swan song.“They were going to send me to hospice,” Sure told me the other day. “ It was a fatal situation. There was no way out of it.”After a battery of tests, doctors determined that Sure needed a new liver. The transplant saved his life.But he’s not out of the woods yet. In addition to the 20 pills he swallows every day, Sure, born Albert Brown III, has to take constant blood tests to make sure his body isn’t rejecting the new organ.These crucial tests are the heart of Sure’s fight for life, and he isn’t just fighting for his own.Earlier this year, a private contractor was allowed to cut Medicare coverage for the life-saving blood test that is able to detect an organ rejection up to months in advanceIt’s the latest in a long line of health care inequities for Blacks and people of color, and Sure, with help from the Rev. Al Sharpton, is determined to do something about it.Last week, Sure and Sharpton announced a new “ Health Equity in Transplantation Coalition” to oppose the Medicare cutbacks, and urge Congress to enact legislation to reverse the restrictions.“Black, Hispanic, Latino and underserved communities were given a lifeline with these non-invasive tests,” Sharpton said. “That was taken away in March 2023, when a private company decided Medicare would no longer cover this life-saving measure for transplant recipients, who overwhelmingly come from these communities. It’s time we reverse this decision and allow transplant recipients to have access to more and better tools — not less.”Black and Latino Americans account for 40% of transplant recipients in the nation, according to the coalition. They also account for 50% of the 100,000 people on the transplant waiting list.Instead of the blood tests, Medicare coverage is now extended to a surgical biopsy to determine organ rejection. But Sure said the biopsies are invasive, risky and could be too late.“The blood tests can detect rejection three months early,” Sure said. “The physical manifestations don’t reveal themselves right away. Thank goodness I have the means and insurance to cover medical expenses. But we have to do something about the entire system. Don’t take something away from people’s lives.”The coalition has gotten a boost from the unlikeliest of supporters —- former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. They are hoping to enlist the Congressional Black Caucus to join the fight.Sure, who used to tour with New Edition and once sold out Madison Square Garden for four straight nights, said he is still proud of his Grammy nominations, his American Music Award and his work with Quincy Jones.But he said his new lease on life comes with a higher purpose.“I can write love songs all day and have No.1 hit records,” Sure said. “But this is the real work.”Sure said he is as dedicated to medical equity as he is to his own health, and is prepared to work 24/7 to achieve the goal.In other words, night and day."
leoweekly_2023_55,"Dear Oracle,I’m a post-doc Ph.D. in a research field, and I’m in the slog of trying to find a job when my current post ends. I keep having leads in Academia, and what’s annoying is I get to the interview stage, and then they always give it to someone else. Even at my current university, the other post-doc got a TT position because she’s lucky, and I can’t even get adjunct. It’s stupid and stressful, and I want to HAVE a job already. I don’t know why I’m not getting hired. Do the cards have an answer?-Burned & Burned OutCards: Four of Swords (rev. , Two of Cups (rev. , Five of Cups, First QuarterDear Burned:First, I’m sorry for the agony of the job search. As someone who worked in academia before and during the pandemic, I know that teaching positions are now more competitive and precarious than five years ago and often offer even less. It’s cutthroat, and I’m sorry for the stress.With these specific cards, you may not be coming across as your best self in your interviews.Academia is a closed loop. Many people who get tenure stay in the same positions for years, if not decades. That means they also work — and socialize — with the same group of people for much of that time. Likability does become a factor because, at a certain point, all the applicants are qualified and brilliant. It’s not “Who can do the job?” but “Who can do the job while playing well with others?”With the Four of Swords and Two of Cups reserved, I wonder if you’re coming across with a bit of a chip on your shoulder and possibly trash-talking your colleagues. (You did insult your fellow post-doc in the question. The Four of Swords particularly suggests a wounded ego and an abrasive spirit, so coupled with shit-talk, the interviewer might wonder how well you’d fit in with the rest of the gang in the department.The Five of Cups also suggests that you might be more pessimistic, troubled by whatisn’thappening, and not celebrating what is. If you seem overly critical, that might also affect your chances of landing a teaching position. Humorless, hard-ass professors tend to have sub-par student evals and lower enrollment numbers, which is a kiss of death. While your job is to educate, first and foremost, likability helps with job security.Now, I don’t know if this ego-wound is from the job-hunting process or is part of a larger story. (Therapy could be beneficial right now. But the First Quarter Moon card is about making decisions and challenging yourself to grow. Give yourself some rest, and meditate on what kind of professor/colleague you would like to be. How do you want to feel? How do you want to be seen by others? What does it look like to be your best self? What choices can you make to be that best self? How can you grow?This isn’t easy work. As Malcolm X said, “The examined life is painful,” but by getting outside of the situation, you might be able to see an answer.Best of luck, my darling.Dear Oracle,My fiancé and I have been engaged for a year, and while I am so excited to marry him, the actual wedding planning part has been intensely stressful. Between complex family situations and finances, it has kept us both up at night. We finally decided to have a ceremony with just the two of us in a special location. This feels so right! But I’m also worried about hurting the feelings of dear friends and family. How do I navigate this?-Wedding WorriesCards: Three of Wands, Strength, Seven of Cups, Ten of CupsDear WW,Mazel tov on your engagement and upcoming elopement!I’ve written before about weddings and will reiterate that oftentimes, weddings are about so much more than the happy couple. Friendships end, family ties sever, people act out in weird, atrocious ways for attention. It can be a complex minefield, and it does seem like the way to avoid that is to just skip the whole thing and elope.But, as you already feel and will learn, people may express hurt even though this decision is about what’s best for you and your fiancé.The cards advise you to be gracious to those who got you to this point but to own your choice. With the nostalgic Three of Wands, of course, there are people you love who you know would want to celebrate with you. These friends and family will understand, and not guilt trip you. (Some people do like to honor those they love, so if someone wants to throw you a little party afterward, let them. Same with gifts—if it’s how they express their love, just take ‘em. You can exchange them later if you must. What you need, however, is the strength to know that you made the right decision. The Seven of Cups shows deceptive paths that may have looked fine (just the parents! Just the two best friends! but would have been the wrong choice. It’s so easy for weddings to spiral out of control and for other’s egos to get in the way, and it’s easy to just go with it. But the Strength card shows that you and your fiancé made this decision together and are walking into a new life as equals.And it’s going to work out well! The Ten of Cups is the happily-ever-after marriage card, the love story completed. You and your fiancé are going to be married! How wonderful is that feeling? The wedding is only the first day of marriage, and hopefully, your elopement will be special and intimate and set the stage for a marriage where you two follow your intuition and do what’s best for you as a couple, even in the face of outside pressure and judgment.Mazel tov, babies.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_32,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°On Oct. 10, days after Hamas launched its depraved attack on Israel, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about some progressive members in Congress who were calling for a cease-fire and de-escalation. She did not try to hide her disgust.“We believe they’re wrong,” she declared at a press conference. “We believe they’re repugnant and we believe they’re disgraceful.”Yikes. What exactly did these progressives, most of whom are a part of what’s called “The Squad,” say that was so outside of the bounds of civilized discourse?Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said that, besides “condemning Hamas’ attacks, we must also oppose an Israeli military response that has already taken the lives of hundreds of Palestinians.”Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., said she was “heartbroken” by the violence against Israeli civilians but also called for “ending U.S. government support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.”And Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the only Palestinian-American member of Congress, said: “The failure to recognize the violent reality of living under siege, occupation, and apartheid makes no one safer. No person, no child anywhere should have to suffer or live in fear of violence. We cannot ignore the humanity in each other.”Such talk has led to the filing of censure resolutions against Tlaib in Congress. It also got her chased through the hallways of a House office building by a Fox News reporter demanding to know whether she objected to “Hamas terrorists chopping off babies’ heads,” referring to unverified reports. She told the news outlet Michigan Advance, “I do not support the targeting and killing of civilians, whether in Israel or Palestine.”Even before Israel’s planned ground invasion to wipe Hamas off the face of the Earth, the death toll involving Palestinian civilians has far surpassed the 1,400 Israelis killed in the original Oct. 7 attack. Of the more than 8,300 Palestians who have perished as of Oct. 30, nearly 3,500 are children.The argument has been made by the American Jewish Committee and others that the deaths are not comparable, as Hamas deliberately targeted civilians while those who have been foreseeably killed by Israel’s punishing air strikes are “collateral damage.” It’s a distinction whose relevance is likely to be lost on those who are killed, and those left to mourn them. What’s disgraceful and repugnant is war itself.I, for one, do not want a single penny of my tax dollars to pay for missiles that end the lives of children, no matter how wrong a place they happen to be in at how wrong a time. I do not want the United States to help Israel deliver the oversized carnage that ensures an endless supply of future martyrs for Hamas’ bloody cause.In this war, as in others that have come before, our capacity for decency is being put to the test. There is a decades-long legacy of oppression of Palestinians that must be acknowledged. There is a need for restraint in Israel’s national defense that deserves support both from within that country and from the global community.I join with those on the progressive left, in Congress and elsewhere, who say there’s been enough killing already.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

eugeneweekly_2023_53,"We ve got issues. Most everyone by now knows of theDobbscase from the Supreme Court that overruledRoe v. Wade. It is noteworthy, as well as foreboding, that the majority conservative bloc on the court instructed us that their search of history revealed no evidence that women had any rights in their bodies that were ever recognized by the exclusively male power ruling institutions existent over the millennia before the adoption of our Constitution in 1789. Rather than condemn that history as inequality and injustice borne of ignorance, the Supreme Court instead voted to perpetuate it as if chiseled in stone, with no flexibility despite evolving knowledge and societal recognition of basic human rights applicable to all people. This, in reality, is the grim fallacy of originalism, the technique of interpreting the Constitution through the lens of its long dead, white male, slave-holding drafters and the traditions of their era. It sentences today’s populace and legislators to bear the chains of yesterday’s limited knowledge and even prejudice. A fair analogy would be a Supreme Court ruling that modern medicine is constitutionally limited to those remedies for disease known to doctors in the 18th century. Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organizationis one example of jurisprudence lagging far behind society. To peg a judicial ruling in the 21st century on archaic views about women centuries ago is not only irrational, it carries on the despicable tradition of misogyny in past cultures. Thus the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals applied the originalist formula, using the lens of white males from centuries ago, to legislation prohibiting possession of firearms by those with domestic violence restraining orders, to rule that such orders violate the Second Amendment rights of the abuser, as in the recent case ofUnited States v. Zackey Rahimi. This decision illustrates the folly of the originalist approach to today’s issues and our attempts to fashion legislative solutions. First, the firearms of 200 years ago are not the firearms of today. A single-shot musket is not the firearm of a high velocity semi-automatic with large capacity magazines and high velocity bullets that pierce body armor. Second, domestic violence committed by the firearms of yesteryear does not appear to have been an issue addressed back then, so it is not surprising to find no guidance from analogies in that era. We live in different times, with exponentially greater dangers from the weaponry on the market now, not then. Yet the courts are supposedly bound by a dearth of guidance from a non-existent and even ignored problem in past history. The facts of theRahimicase are disturbing; if anything, they demonstrate the need to prohibit possession of firearms by those presenting a threat of domestic violence. Rahimi had a history of gun violence — he had fired multiple shots into a person’s residence, followed the next day by shooting at a driver of a vehicle that he had collided with. He then returned in a different car and shot again at the other car, subsequently shot at a constable’s vehicle, and continued his spree by firing multiple shots in the air after an acquaintance’s credit card was declined at a burger restaurant. A judicial restraining order was filed against him after he assaulted his girlfriend that prohibited him from stalking her or possessing a firearm. He nonetheless continued to possess firearms despite the order and was charged with a felony under federal firearms law. The 5th Circuit overturned his conviction, holding that, notwithstanding his history of gun violence, the court’s search of history of the 18th century and even earlier common law heritage did not reflect any analogies that would indicate that our forefathers would have taken away his right to possess guns under the Second Amendment. Translated: Back in those days, the victim was fair game for retribution rather than forfeiting the abuser’s right to a gun. That’s originalism in a graphic nutshell. It is beyond stupid. It confronts modern problems with ancient views about other things far off the mark. If the reader has the appetite, I invite them to digest the court’s fare about Charles I, Charles II, Oliver Cromwell, the English Militia Act of 1662 etc. on your trip down the rabbit hole. Bottom line — all this is a nonsensical distraction to keep our country marooned in a time warp of white male supremacy governance. The media today is overwhelmed with almost daily accounts of entire families being murdered by armed domestic violence terrorists taking vengeance over a failed marriage or relationship. This is the outcome all too often that absolutist Second Amendment jurisprudence wreaks on its victims. Incidents like these necessitate meaningful gun regulation and repeated calls to focus attention on the urgent need to protect the people, not the absolutist gun rights advocates or the profit margins of the gun industry. This is the true cost, paid every day throughout our country, because of our clueless unhinged judiciary that wants to be guided forever by dead white guys. This is even insulting to the memories of the deceased founders, who placed the interests of the people in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as the supreme goal of government."

Drugs, terror and war were the stories, but mixed in were tales of local heroism, tottering taters and new schools.“Taters totter off truck” that was the June headline that sent eyes rolling. “Nearly every eye on Turlington Road was rolling late Tuesday afternoon. And the rest of them were chasing after the hundreds of spuds scattered and splattered all over the artery that connects U S. Route 58 and Carolina Road. Police received a call around 6:20 p.m. alerting them that a top-heavy trailer traveling down Turlington Road had lost part of its load, dispatchers said. The truck apparently did not stop, leaving a smorgasbord of potatoes being served in its wake: mashed, sliced, diced, chunked and, of course, traditional tire-tread taters.”In the middle of July 2000, the Suffolk News-Herald was sold. Boone Newspapers Inc. (now Boone Newsmedia finalized its purchase of the News-Herald and four other local Media General newspapers. The purchase brought a familiar name back to Suffolk. James B. Boone Jr., who owned Boone Newspapers with his five children, was publisher of the News-Herald from 1961 to 1968. He bought the News-Herald, he said, because of the “opportunity to serve a growing and vital community that has importance to my family, and me.” His old office sat only a few feet away from the newsroom. He has fond memories of Suffolk, he said in an email, among them “what I learned, about newspaper editing and publishing, and civic opportunity, the friends I made. Suffolk is a community I could have spent my whole life in, and been happy. But circumstances and family obligations took me elsewhere. I made many friends during my seven years there, (and look forward to renewing those friendships.”The school year started in September 2001 with students excited to attend a new school. Classrooms at the new King’s Fork Middle School were big, bright and airy. “This is a school paradise,” said Azalea Joyner, 12, looking around the window-filled library. The seventh-grader was one of more than 900 students who starred in the debut of the school. It was the city’s first new middle school building ever to be constructed; previous middle schools had always been opened in older high school structures.On Sept. 11, 2001, the world watched in horror as the United States was attacked. The front page the day after covered the devastation, the increased security and the community unity that would be seen nationwide for months to follow. What follows are snippets of the front page stories of the News-Herald on Sept. 12.“In the most devastating terrorist onslaught ever waged against the United States, hijackers crashed two airliners into the World Trade Center on Tuesday, toppling its twin 110-story towers. The deadly calamity was witnessed on televisions across the world as another plane slammed into the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed outside Pittsburgh. Said Adm. Robert J. Natter, commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet: ‘We have been attacked like we haven’t since Pearl Harbor.’”“Rev. T. Floyd Irby Jr., pastor of West End Baptist, said his church will be open for prayer until dark. Rev. Stewart McCarter of Southside Baptist said, ‘We will be having a prayer service at 7 p.m. Wednesday and the church will be open during the day for prayer. ‘Of course it’s a tragedy of a magnitude that hasn’t been seen since World War II,’ he said. ‘So maybe we understand the capacity of evil in the world. But people of good will need to be working to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ and working toward peace.’”“Although the city increased security after Tuesday’s terrorist attacks, it did not implement emergency measures as strong as some neighboring Hampton Roads cities. ‘The biggest thing we are doing now is increasing security at some key facilities in the city,’ said Capt.

Do such things not apply to Jewish students?The blowback to the hearing was swift and bipartisan, with Stefanik earning praise, explicitly or implicitly, from unlikely corners. With an effective bit of political theater, the North Country Republican had exposed something dark.What’s particularly dumbfounding about the responses is that genocide against Jews isn’t theoretical or unimaginable. It literally happened within recent memory. It’s both a fresh horror and a historical throughline. Condemning it should be easy.Magill, Gay and Kornbluth have spent the days since apologizing and attempting to clarify — damage control, in other words.Magill even released a video in which she looked like a hostage being forced to mouth words from a cue card. She noted “the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate.”Gay, meanwhile, issued a statement that said, among other things: “Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.”Will they, though? Given the scenes recently on campuses around the country, we might wonder if that’s true, which is why Congress held the hearing on collegiate antisemitism in the first place. (In related news, the U.S. Department of Education is investigating Union College in Schenectady after Jewish students filed a discrimination complaint. Don’t equate this with a First Amendment question. Yes, every student should feel free to protest the Israeli government and how the country is conducting its response to the Hamas terrorism. Condemnation of Israel’s policies and concern about the plight of Palestinians are not necessarily antisemitic, of course, and even ugly, horrific or violence-endorsing speech is generally protected against governmental interference.But that doesn’t mean that hateful language comes without consequences. We’re talking about codes of conduct, remember, and we know that calling for the harm of nearly any other minority group would not be tolerated under the rules in place at most schools.It would be one thing if colleges were true bastions of free speech and consistently took a hands-off approach to discriminatory rhetoric. But that hasn’t been the direction of travel. Many schools have become increasingly intolerant of free debate and expression, with some even releasing lists of everyday words that students and staffers should not say.Yet hateful language directed at Jewish students is tolerated? The double standard and lack of consistency are striking.© 2023 The New York Times Company"
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_39,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Washington seems determined to ignore the country’s rapidly worsening fiscal picture, but sooner or later policymakers will be forced to pay attention. When they do, they’ll find that changes to Social Security are unavoidable.No doubt, any such effort will meet strong political resistance. That’s why nothing has been done for 40 years and counting. The best approach — on the merits and as a matter of political feasibility — would combine entitlement reform with fresh thinking about financial security in retirement.Thanks to relentless pressure from an aging population, Social Security is expected to exhaust its financial reserves in 2033. At that point, without offsetting action, benefits will automatically be cut by a quarter.The program’s last big overhaul, in 1983, scheduled a gradual rise in the normal retirement age from 65 to the current 67. Life expectancy will increase further over the coming decades, and longer retirements will continue to raise costs. Indexing the normal retirement age to longevity (meaning a constant ratio of years in retirement to years in work would imply a normal retirement age of 69 by 2075. This would close about 40% of the long-term fiscal shortfall. The rest could come from higher revenue — for example, through raising the income cap on payroll tax above the current $160,200.While some combination of lower spending and higher revenue is necessary, it’s true that a higher retirement age will weigh more heavily on lower-wage workers. At present workers can choose to retire on a reduced benefit as soon as age 62, and many do. Early retirees may be dealing with poor health or quitting physically demanding jobs, and life expectancy is lower among the poor. So the needed fiscal reforms should be combined with steps to improve financial security in retirement, especially for the low-paid.The best way to do this would be to ensure that all workers are enrolled in a supplementary retirement-savings account. The government could direct that employers deposit, say, 3% of each worker’s earnings in a new universal account unless the worker opts out. It could also encourage low-wage workers to participate by matching their contributions, covering the cost of this subsidy by curbing the tax benefits granted to holders of existing retirement accounts — benefits that flow almost entirely to the highest-income workers.The Thrift Savings Plan for federal workers is a possible model. It emphasizes low costs and maximum simplicity. Participants’ contributions vest immediately; the government’s match vests over time. By default the plan allocates funds between safe and risky pools of assets according to each member’s years remaining in work. Participants can override those choices if they wish and spread their investments across a range of approved alternatives. On retirement, balances can be converted to annuities with protection against inflation.The U.K.’s successful National Employment Savings Trust, known as Nest, works along similar lines. A universal scheme in the U.S. would supplement Social Security and help workers, especially those on low incomes, enjoy a decent standard of living in retirement. By encouraging people who don’t save much to put away more, it would also most likely boost savings. By reducing the misdirected subsidies in the existing mishmash of investment tax shelters, it could be made revenue-neutral, all while improving the prospects for pulling Social Security back toward solvency.— BloombergHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

eugeneweekly_2023_58,"We ve got issues. I got a text around 8 pm, two days before Christmas Eve from Maria,* the asylum seeker I sponsor. She told me Lorenzo’s wife, Hilda, was on her way to Eugene, and due to bleak weather conditions, her flight had landed in Portland. Lorenzo, who had come from Nicaragua over a year and a half ago and was excited to reunite with his beloved, had been working two jobs and saving to bring Hilda back to him. He had managed to first bring her brother here, who had also been working non-stop. We all started brainstorming how we might help bring Hilda home. My daughter lives in Portland, but no one was driving in the horrific icy weather. Hilda knew no English and she and Lorenzo were in contact by cell phone. My advice: Go to the airport desk and find someone who speaks Spanish. But Hilda was, naturally, terribly shy in a strange new country. Texts continued to be passed back and forth between all of us. Lorenzo bought his wife a train ticket. How to get her from the airport to the train station? It seems easy, right? But it’s not easy being a brand-new asylum seeker. Hilda was afraid to leave the airport as her Mexican-bought phone had no internet access once she stepped outside the airport. She ended up staying the night and no doubt trying to sleep (? in the airport. The next day I didn’t hear much from Maria. I thought I understood that Lorenzo was going to take a train or bus up to Portland to help his wife come back to Eugene. “What an endearing husband,” I thought. But finally what happened is that Lorenzo got Hilda an Uber ride to the train station. I turned my phone off to go to bed. The next morning I saw Maria’s text: Hilda had arrived safely around midnight. It was Christmas Eve and I had invited Maria, her wife Marisol, Hilda, Lorenzo and his brother-in-law to all gather and celebrate at my house. Maria and Marisol had spent much of the day cooking. When I picked them up from their trailer home, they had trays and trays of their prepared Salvadoran dishes. Later as I opened my door and Lorenzo’s family entered, I gave Hilda an extra long welcoming hug. She beamed with appreciation. What a beautiful evening we shared with simple presents, delicious food and loving Spanish and English words flowing. I asked Hilda and Lorenzo about their children. They showed me adorable pictures of their 5 and 8 year olds. Where were they? They were with Hilda’s mother in Nicaragua. Maria and Marisol were still waiting to bring Marisol’s older daughters to Eugene. Lorenzo and Hilda smiled. Yes, they would be working at eventually bringing their children to Eugene.

suffolknewsherald_2023_195,"Published 3:29 pm Friday, September 15, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldAs we say farewell to Suffolk Police Chief Al Chandler and congratulate him on his over four decades of service to the City of Suffolk, we must look forward to the qualities we seek in his successor and the changes we wish to see inside SPD.Replacing a police chief is never an easy task and requires an immense amount of vetting and due process to ensure the best fit for the city’s needs will be met. The search also allows the city to reevaluate its law enforcement agency and identify the most critical needs of Suffolkians.One critical aspect that needs urgent attention is the increase in violent crime in the city. According to Virginia State Police, violent crimes include offenses of murder, forcible sex offenses, robbery, and aggravated assault.VSP’s Crime in Virginia report shows that in its violent crime section, murder and non-negligent manslaughter saw an increase during 2022, with 12 in the city. That’s up from seven in 2021, three in 2020, six in 2019 and just two in 2018. Aggravated assaults ran about the same in 2022 and the year prior at 372 and 383, respectively. However, these are up from past years as the report shows aggravated assaults at 299 in 2020, 173 in 2019 and 151 in 2018, according to the report. Robberies and rapes ran in the same range during the five years between 2018 and 2022, according to the report. There were 61 robberies in 2022, up by two at 59 in 2021. The reports show there were 49 robbery reports in 2020, down from 67 in 2019 and 69 in 2018. The VSP report also shows rape is on the rise in the city. Forcible rape violations were up over the past five years, hitting 35 in 2022. That’s up from 29 in 2021 and 20 in 2020. In 2019 there were 30 reported forcible rapes and 2018 saw 31 reported forcible rapes, according to the report.The community deserves answers about the department’s plans to combat this problem. That answer must be met with the public’s resounding sense of security. Likewise, the public and city council must understand the challenges SPD faces while combating violent crime, and plans must be put in place to assist the department to be effective. This must also be met with a resounding level of confidence from the public that those in leadership roles will put their agendas to the side for the betterment and safety of Suffolk.Another aspect that requires attention is transparency within the police department. Transparency builds trust between the community and law enforcement and ensures accountability. The public holds law enforcement to higher standards than most government agencies. When members of law enforcement violate laws, they break public trust and lose credibility, no matter the severity of the infraction.As the city searches for a new police chief, we must prioritize candidates committed to transparency in their operations. This includes openly sharing data on violent crime increase, use of force incidents, disciplinary actions, and community engagement efforts.The events of recent years have highlighted the importance of reform and rebuilding trust between the police and the communities they serve. It’s time for cities to invest in more innovative policing models, training in de-escalation techniques and mental health crisis response teams. These reforms should be championed by the new police chief, who must be willing to adapt and embrace change.As we celebrate Chandler’s retirement as a dedicated police chief who served the citizens well in his time with the Suffolk Police Department, we must seize the opportunity to re-imagine policing in our community.Transparency, accountability, and community engagement should be at the forefront of our expectations for the new chief, who will lead us into a safer tomorrow.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

But like most females, she can’t make up her mind.She starts spring in the pink— literally — with rosebuds everywhere. Light pink, dark pink, some nearly purple pink. Drive I-64 to Charlottesville in early spring, and you’ll see thousands of them along the road. There are also pink tulip trees in yards, too, but they’re non-native. So… pretty in pink, yes?No! Now she goes all yellow. Daffodils — everywhere — daffodils. Some little old lady planted daffodils at Chippokes Plantation and Lonestar Lakes and now they’re everywhere. Wild in the woods. Or there’s Carolina jasmine, that yellow vine you see everywhere in the woods along the road. Then fields become carpets of buttercups. Then the trees take over and rain yellow tulips in your front yard. Even the weeds — dandelions — are pretty yellow. Yellow wins, you say?No! Here come the reds, blues, purples. Azaleas, like the daffies, were once limited imports, but now they’re everywhere— from orange to purple to red — every conceivable color. Then there are the rhododendrons, mainly purple. Drive through the mountains of western Virginia. And how about the irises? Talk about your purple.So Mother Nature has changed her gaudy mind again, We’ve gone from pink to yellow to purples, etc. — is that it?Nope. White — bright white on green everywhere. Dogwoods. our state tree, are everywhere in the woods and neighborhoods. Luckily the non-native pink ones don’t spread. They’re white, white, white — on green. Then come the mountain laurels — smaller blooms but just as white/green. Even the woods and invasive are white— little white daisy-like fleabane. Asian honeysuckle and invasive multiflora roses. Ever see any pink or yellow on a magnolia tree? Nope— they’re bright, bright white.Finally Mother Nature is elbowed aside by the money of the nurseries and Lowe’s, and store-bought plants take over the gardens. They’re everywhere— impatiens, marigolds, coreopsis — ad infinitum. Roses, no less. Betcha ya won’t see any of them in the mountains.But Ma Nature has all the garden centers beat— and for free.

leoweekly_2023_1,"When Henry Kissingerdied this past week, articles used words like “complicated” and “difficult” to describe him and the decisions he made that adversely affected the lives of millions in Cambodia, Chile, East Timor, and Bangladesh. Political maneuvering to protect state interests, I guess, could be difficult, but Kissinger chose ideology over morality, and that’s why what is happening now around the world is causing such a headache and debate here at home.We all have to make difficult decisions. We have to pick the lesser of two evils many times, and most of us choose that path. But there are times when the difficult decision makes some lean into the side of ideology over what is best for humanity, and during this holiday season, I’d like us all to reflect on that thought.Ideology vs. morality. Both are systems of deeply held beliefs but one connects us to others in a way that is flesh and bone instead of words on paper and praxis. Ideology lives in theory and operation, whereas morality often exists in the flesh and experience of the human being. Morality and morals are closely linked, but what we often call “morals” is ideology in practice.All of these concepts are mutable and can change as societies and thoughts of humankind shift.What we once allowed as ideological people and under the morality we were brought up with before we learned to be critical and to examine more deeply seems to be undergoing a drastic shift in today’s political climate. These changes have given rise to the #MeToo movement, Black Lives Matter, Occupy, and other recent political positions, including ideological right-wing movements like Right to Life and the Tea Party. All of these movements have shifted our beliefs and, in turn, challenged what we think of as moral and correct in our lives. More and more Americans seem to understand that we are our brothers’ keepers, and that means it is our responsibility to consider the whole and not just the individual. With that said, rugged American individualism dies hard, and it is fighting for its life right now.So when our eyes look back at someone like Kissinger, we are horrified. How could he remain a free man, fed and watered on a pension of our tax dollars after causing the deaths of millions of people around the world? How can he be considered palatable by any stretch of the imagination?Kissinger represents the moral failing of U.S. foreign policy, and as we see our leaders make similar mistakes, we’re dealing with big dilemmas. How can we separate our morality from our ideology to do what is best for humanity?I don’t have an answer, but I know that as we move into another year, the more I see political maneuvering and the treatment of our power in the world, I’m disheartened that we still deem some people worth more than others instead of looking for ways to bring solutions so that more people can survive and build together instead of moving farther and farther apart.Take that how you will, readers, but I hope that in the new year, your heart leads you toward kindness, fairness, and a true sense that you can and do affect all of the people around you.‘Til 2024.• ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_115,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°To those who grumble that Jan. 6, 2021, is ancient history and everyone should just move on already, we offer rebuttal in the person of Missouri state Sen. Denny Hoskins. The Warrensburg Republican, who is in the running next year to become the state’s top election official, has filed legislation to require hand-counting of the state’s roughly 3 million ballots.His backward rationale is that it would make voting more secure and accurate. In fact, all serious data indicates the opposite is true — unless, of course, you’re fully vested in the MAGA-manufactured myth that ballot-counting machines are being hacked by foreign governments and other dark forces.It’s anyone’s guess whether Hoskins is truly this delusional, or is merely playing to the persecution fantasies of the fringe right. But it’s one of the two.The worst domestic assault against American democracy since the Civil War culminated on Jan. 6, but it began earlier. In the weeks before the mob of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters attacked the Capitol, Trump and his surrogates laid the groundwork by spreading outrageous, easily disproved lies about supposed election fraud. Among the loopiest was that tabulating machines used to count paper ballots had been compromised to flip votes to challenger Joe Biden.For an indication of just how far down the rabbit hole this conspiracy-mongering went, consider that a voting-machine company called Dominion Voting Systems this year landed a landmark libel settlement from Fox News for almost $800 million. Among the deranged, entirely fictional allegations the network allowed Trump surrogates to spin on its shows was that Dominion was formed to fix elections by associates of the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez.You can’t make this stuff up — except, Trump and his lawyers did, again and again.No significant instances of election fraud were ever uncovered, despite the most vigorous post-election reviews in U.S. history. Dozens of courts threw out Trump’s claims as utterly baseless. Even now, some of Trump’s former lawyers are facing lawsuits and disbarment for peddling his lies.Still, Trump continues peddling those lies even today, attempting to make next year’s election a referendum on the validity of the last one. It’s a cynical and dangerous crusade to erode Americans’ confidence in their elections.Hoskins, running for Missouri secretary of state next year, is effectively endorsing that crusade with his legislation to hand-count all Missouri ballots. He says it’s based on “concerns” from “a lot of people” about “the accuracy of tabulating machines.” Yet he can’t cite a single shred of evidence that there’s been any actual security problem with the machines.Even most of Hoskins’ fellow Republicans understand that hand-counting ballots is unfeasible because it would require immense staffing and would delay election results for weeks or months — and then would yield numbers more likely to be corrupted by human error or mischief.But unfeasibility isn’t the most offensive aspect of it. To the extent that the public has “concerns” about election validity, they have been planted by Trump’s big lie and by legislation like this, which lends that lie undeserved credibility. Peddling this kind of corrosive conspiracy hokum should be disqualifying for statewide office.—St. Louis Post-Dispatch Editorial Board/TNSDuring the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI."
suffolknewsherald_2023_204,"Published 5:29 pm Tuesday, September 5, 2023ByJen JaquaAs 1985 began, minds were on safety. In January, a House committee approved legislation sponsored by Suffolk Del. J. Samuel Glasscock seeking mandatory use of seatbelts.As the discussions over schools continued, a new program launched a summer pilot. Nineteen Suffolk public and private school students honed their talents in the performing and visual arts when they participated in the Governor’s Magnet School.The summer program was scheduled to be repeated in 1986, and a full-time fine arts school for regional high schoolers started in the fall of ’86.Newspapers have often been a way to spread the word about crime. In one case, the criminal herself spread the word. In April 1985, a woman who had fled Suffolk while being sought on charges of torching and killing her boyfriend was arrested in New York. She had been carrying a month-old “wanted” Crime Line clipping from the Suffolk News-Herald in her purse. When she began showing that clipping to acquaintances in the Bronx, one of them turned her in to New York police in order to receive the reward.In the ’80s, boomboxes were the way to listen to your music while you were on the go. However, many public areas began outlawing them as a nuisance to the public. In October of ’85, Virginia Beach joined the list of places banning boomboxes at the oceanfront and on the boardwalk.On Jan. 28, 1986, thousands of people, including schoolchildren across the nation, watched as the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded two minutes after liftoff. The explosion killed its seven-member crew, including teacher Christa McAuliffe. The spacecraft veered wildly out of control and fell toward the ocean. A brilliant ball of incandescent flame erupted when the $1.1 billion shuttle exploded.For one Suffolk teacher, the shuttle explosion had a bigger impact than most. Like Christa McAuliffe, Suffolk teacher Sonny Dixon had applied to NASA seeking to become the first teacher in space. “You know going in there is a risk,” Dixon said. “Part of the challenge is looking at the odds and looking at the benefits.” The Elephant’s Fork Elementary School teacher said the reason she applied was for the “sense of adventure,” and the opportunity to share the experience with her students.Suffolk has a rich history and, in 1986, thanks to Diane Story’s third grade class, Suffolk got something it never had before — a folk tale. Peter Peanut, Big Joe the hog, Momma Bear and a forest full of chorus students came to life on the Elephant’s Fork Elementary School stage. “My, my, it’s almost time for the Peanut Fest and I can’t find my children anywhere,” muses “Momma” Diane Story as the play begins. This turns out to be a setting for the tale itself, which Story’s third grade wrote. “Long ago and not so far away in the Dismal Swamp…’” Her narrative fades abruptly as Peter Peanut makes his appearance, a few feet short of his famous 7-foot, 5-inch height, and wearing a coal black beard. Ben Sylvia plays the oversized peanut fanner raised by a mother bear in the swamp, where a Suffolk couple finds and adopts him. Peter is such a faithful farmer that even pretty girls cannot distract him. “Please, Peter please,” they sing. “Won’t you dance with us just tonight?” “I can’t. I’ve got to plant peanuts,” is his steadfast reply.Even the School Board chairman got in the act, inadvertently. Big Joe, the “over-sized prized Suffolk Hog,” bears his name. “They wanted to name him after Mr. (Joe Barlow because he’s our peanut farmer,” Story says. Big Joe’s claim to fame is his ability to make furrows “just the right depth and length for planting peanuts” simply by snorting. Peter Peanut’s tale has been officially recognized as Suffolk’s Folk Tale.1986 ended with more discussions on safety and education. Members of the Family Life Curriculum committee heard arguments for and against family life education. Dr. Edward D. Harris, director of the Suffolk Health Department, told an audience of 15 committee members that sex education is the only way to combat teen pregnancy and the spread of STDs. The committee was appointed by the School Board to decide whether family life education courses should be introduced into Suffolk public schools.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_81,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°“Very fine people.”That’s what then-President Donald Trump in 2017 called white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a Nazi supporter plowed a car into a crowd of counter protestors, and killed one of the demonstrators.Fast forward to last week, after heartless terrorists launched a cowardly sneak attack that killed more than 1,300 Israelis and wounded thousands more.Hamas carried out the attack, but Trump found a way to heap praise on Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based terrorist group with ties to Iran that attacked Israel from the north.“Two nights ago, I read all of Biden’s security people, can you imagine, national defense people, and they said, ‘Gee, I hope Hezbollah doesn’t attack from the north, because that’s the most vulnerable spot,’” Trump said during a rally in West Palm Beach, Fla. “I said, ‘Wait a minute.’ You know, Hezbollah is very smart. They’re all very smart.”Smart? Really? All of them?How smart is it to kill women, children and elderly people, and drag victims of barbaric violence through the streets?How smart is it to kidnap as many as 150 people and hold them as hostages, with the threat of executing them if Israel targets people in Gaza without warning?Trump blamed Israel for not being prepared, and said that if he were still president, the attack would have never happened. His ill-timed remarks were callous and incendiary, much like everything he says. It’s enough to make you want to quote Ron DeSantis.“Terrorists have murdered at least 1,200 Israelis and 22 Americans and are holding more hostage,” tweeted DeSantis, the Republican Florida governor who is running for president.“So it is absurd that anyone, much less someone running for President, would choose now to attack our friend and ally, Israel, much less praise Hezbollah terrorists as ‘very smart.’ As President, I will stand with Israel and treat terrorists like the scum that they are.”Words matter. Timing matters. This war is as much about propaganda as it is about anything else.That’s why it is laudable that state Attorney General Letitia James would urge social media companies to crack down on hate speech and threats of violence in the wake of the Gaza attack.Such posts only encourage more violence and hatred and put vulnerable people at risk.The same can be said for some of the protest rhetoric that has been spewed in recent days across New York City — home to more Jews than anywhere but Israel.If you’re going to gather on an American college campus and loudly support shameless murderers and terrorists who think nothing of killing and torturing people by the thousands, then don’t be cowards and hide behind masks and bandanas like the Students for Justice in Palestine did the other day at Columbia University“Despite the odds against them, Palestinians launched a counter offensive against our settler colonial oppressor, which receives billions of U.S. dollars in military aid and possesses one of the world’s most robust surveillance and security apparatuses,” one of the protest leaders said. “Any omission of this context. Any rhetoric of an unprovoked Palestinian attack is shamefully misleading,”Also misleading is the notion that all speech is free. There is a cost. And right now, we’re all paying."

Peaceful negotiations and resolutions should prevail in any conflict or crisis, if possible.I’d like to share with you a scenario of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza:“There are no sounds of Israeli planes. Can you guys hear? There’s a truce. When I heard about the truce, I got really happy. But this truce is temporary, only four days. Oh God, I pray that this truce will improve our conditions and become permanent. I swear life is beautiful like this, without the sounds of drones. I got so happy; I swear I got so happy.”Such was a positive remark or statement by this happy young Palestinian boy from Gaza in a YouTube short video I saw on my smartphone a day after Thanksgiving Day 2023 in America.Reactions from viewers (those who saw the video of this young Palestinian boy with a genuine smile and happiness, hope and optimism were overwhelming.News circulating worldwide on Oct. 7-8 caught the world’s attention: Israel declared war on Gaza after an attack by the Islamic/Palestinian resistance force Hamas on Oct. 7 killed about 1,200 Israelis and held about 240 hostages.At least 14,800 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s bombardment of Gaza since then. The majority of the victims were children and women.While the Israel-Hamas war continued to escalate, ongoing negotiations were held by nations like Qatar, Egypt, and the U.S. After almost 50 days of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, a cease-fire agreement was reached.Friday, Nov. 24, was the start of the 4-day Israel-Hamas cease fire agreement mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the U.S. The cease fire agreement stipulates the exchange of captives/hostages and detainees/prisoners. As part of the cease fire deal, Israel agreed not to fly drones in Gaza for six hours a day.According to the U.N., Israel’s war on Gaza has displaced 80% of the 2.3. million Palestinians.Meanwhile, there’s a growing call by U.N.-member states for a 2-state solution to address the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, despite discussions for a 2-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians have repeatedly failed before the war.Hopefully and prayerfully, the Israel-Hamas cease fire is permanent, and a lasting peaceful solution or resolution is achieved or accomplished by both parties for the sake of humanity and peace, not only in the Middle East but around the world.

To our students old and new, welcome back.May God always bless you and your families, and teachers.This is something that you and I can always do, whether you’re a student, a parent, a teacher, a volunteer, a school counselor, a pastor, a director, a writer, an editor, an instructor, an administrator or whatever or whoever you are.Pray, hope and don’t worry. That’s what St. Padre Pio of Pietrelcina has been telling us, whether we’re having good or bad days. “Worrying is useless. God is merciful and will hear your prayers. Prayer Is the best weapon we have. It is the key to God’s heart,” he said.(Every day, I try to be a good Christian, and Catholic. I always pray not only for myself or my family but also for others. On Sundays, I attend church worship services, i.e. Holy Mass, and Mass and Novena on Wednesdays, just to be in communion with our faith community. After church, I eat out, most of the time, with family and friends.At home, I read the Holy Bible, religious books, magazines and articles that inspire me to live a decent, faith-filled life.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_103,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Saturday’s Hamas terror onslaught from their stronghold in Gaza into Israel, murdering hundreds, was a sneak attack, just like the sneak attack by Egypt and Syria on Israel on Yom Kippur exactly 50 years ago. 9/11 was a sneak attack, as was Pearl Harbor and Hitler’s surprise invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.The targets, be it Israel or the United States or the Russians, are caught off guard by their enemies, stunned, suffering major psychological damage and loss of human life. But then comes the response and the counteroffensive.Those earlier sneak attacks failed. Hopefully, this one will also. We pray it does.Hamas claims that its fighters are soldiers, but soldiers don’t kidnap civilians from their homes to seize them as hostages, as Hamas did in launching raids into Israel in addition to their barrage of thousands of rockets fired at civilian population centers, including Tel Aviv.Both of those are acts of terrorism, which makes perfect sense, as Hamas is a terror group, fittingly on terror lists of the U.S. and European Union.Also on the terror lists is Hezbollah controlling southern Lebanon to Israel’s north, which is keeping that border quiet — for now. The common factor between the Shiite Hezbollah and the Sunni Hamas is the lead sponsor of terror in the region, Iran, which funnels them weapons and joins them in celebrating the atrocities and calling for Israel’s destruction and the “liberation” of Jerusalem from the Jews.Hamas has started this new war, or new chapter in an old war, to disrupt the growing movement for a grand U.S.-brokered peace deal between Israel and the richest and most powerful Arab state, Saudi Arabia, following other U.S.-brokered peace deals between Israel and Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco. Hamas cannot succeed and the Arab-Israeli strides for the larger peace must continue.Hamas shows that it can make war, but it refuses to make peace. The same for Hezbollah. On the West Bank, the head of the Palestinian National Authority, Abu Mazen, also refuses to make peace. It has been years since he has sat down for talks with the Israelis. Peace will come for the Palestinians, in Gaza and the West Bank, when they decide to join the negotiating table.Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, leading a jittery right-wing coalition that is wrongly trying to undermine the independence of the Israeli courts, will get a reprieve for his many domestic troubles due to this Hamas war. Even President Biden, who has been very cool to Netanyahu, has rallied to his side, as he emphasized yesterday from the White House, pledging full support. Of course, Donald Trump is blaming the Hamas attack on Biden.Hamas and Iran want Israel to strike back hard, thinking that a massive response will entrap Israel in the Gaza quicksand, sapping her political and military strength. Israel has the might to level Gaza, but Hamas hides among civilians, using them as human shields, which is a war crime. And Hamas now holds captured Israeli soldiers and civilians, complicating everything.Netanyahu and his commanders have a tremendous challenge before them to destroy Hamas’ military assets while sparing Palestinian civilians in Gaza.Hamas struck first, but their wave of terror will not and cannot prevail.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_78,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°The trickle-down strategies of the last several decades — defined by tax cuts for the wealthy — didn’t work and, in fact, led to stagnating incomes for everyone else. However, the Biden administration’s vision for growth is clear: The Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and CHIPS and Science Act chart a new path based on the philosophy that the economy is strongest when it grows from the “middle out and bottom up.”These sweeping economic laws build out public investment in 21st century infrastructure and support domestic competitiveness in key sectors, all while strengthening protections to ensure new public investment benefits working people from all walks of life.At times, pundits portrayed Bidenomics as a gamble, but key elements of the laws’ middle-class protections — such as prevailing-wage standards — are proven strategies that raise standards for workers, support law-abiding contractors and ensure the public receives good value for the investments paid for by tax dollars.The overwhelming majority of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act funds, and the IRA’s tax credit programs are protected by the Davis-Bacon Act — a 90-year-old law that requires corporations receiving federal funds to pay construction workers market — or “prevailing” — wages and benefits.Prevailing-wage standards, also frequently adopted by state and local policymakers, prevent the government from driving down standards when it acts as a purchaser of goods and services. Private-sector recipients are required to provide workers with wages and fringe benefits comparable to those paid to other similarly placed workers in the region.Research shows that prevailing-wage laws improve workers’ lives by supporting middle-class pay, ensuring union wage rates are not undercut, expanding health insurance and retirement coverage, and closing the income gap between white and Black construction workers.Prevailing-wage laws also benefit responsible contractors and the public by boosting worker productivity, reducing injury rates and increasing apprenticeship training. This helps address the shortage of skilled labor in construction and ensures that projects are completed on time and within budget.Despite significant evidence of prevailing-wage laws benefiting workers, business owners and the public, some lawmakers attempt to undermine these pro-worker laws in favor of trickle-down policies. This has been done through perennial campaigns to roll back federal standards and a handful of actions overturning state-level prevailing-wage laws in recent years. However, studies show that prevailing-wage bans reduce workers’ wages and decrease competition for government projects since contractors that pay decent wages are discouraged from bidding due to concerns of being undercut by low-road contractors that pay rock-bottom wages.Ultimately, the question is not whether prevailing-wage standards work but whether they and other job-quality protections will be adopted broadly enough to make a difference to working people nationwide. While Bidenomics extends prevailing-wage standards for construction workers, similar standards do not automatically apply to all workers whose jobs are funded by federal spending.To ensure that all federal government investments live up to President Joe Biden’s “middle-out” commitments, prevailing-wage standards must be paired with the administration’s other efforts to expand high-quality training for new generations to access publicly supported jobs. Doing so will ensure that the administration can deliver on a vision of growing the middle class— Insidesources.comHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_97,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°With the appropriations fight in Washington in overdrive, and a barely avoided government shutdown behind it – for now – Congress should be paying attention to the latest economic data now more than ever. Recent revisions show things are actually worse than previously estimated.In fact, both the American consumer and the federal budget will soon be at the breaking point if Congress doesn’t rein in spending immediately.The recent comprehensive update to gross domestic product (GDP by the Bureau of Economic Analysis revised data going back several years. It turns out that when President Donald Trump left office, the economy was growing faster than previously estimated, 4.2 percent versus 3.9 percent. Conversely, the data for President Joe Biden’s tenure has been revised down.Under Biden, economic growth was revised down in four quarters, just two quarters were revised up, and four were unchanged. Meanwhile, the recession in the first half of 2022 was worse than previously estimated. Not everything was revised down, however – inflation was revised up, meaning prices have been rising even faster than the government said they were.During Biden’s tenure, inflation data was revised up for seven quarters, down for two quarters, and one quarter was unchanged. Also revised up was government spending, which has now grown faster than consumer spending in each of the last four quarters.In short, growth in government spending is crowding out the private economy, slowing growth, accelerating inflation, and making people worse off. This new data should be a wakeup call for Congress to the nation’s financial plight.Government spending has become an albatross around the neck of the American economy. The big spenders in Washington got addicted to the low interest rates orchestrated by the Federal Reserve for over two decades and they borrowed trillions of dollars, never considering that interest rates might rise one day.With a federal debt of over $33 trillion, the impact of interest rates on federal finances is significant. At low rates, annual financing costs on that much debt are about $600 billion. While that’s nothing to sneeze at, it’s a relatively small portion of the roughly $3 trillion in annual federal revenues.But that calculus changes radically with today’s higher interest rates. Just refinancing the existing debt at these higher rates, without any additional borrowing, will cause financing costs to explode, reaching $1.7 trillion. That’s more than half of federal revenues.This is like a family being in so much credit card debt that over half of the family’s income is used to pay finance charges on those credit cards, without a single cent going towards paying down the credit-card debt.That’s where America is headed. Every day that goes by, more of the existing federal debt is maturing and being refinanced, shifting from a low interest rate to a higher one. On top of the old debt being rolled over, the Treasury is also constantly issuing new debt to finance Congress’ runaway spending, and this new debt is also being issued at higher interest rates.The nation’s current fiscal trajectory is unsustainable. Interest on the debt is already the third-biggest line item in the Fiscal Service’s monthly Treasury statement. In less than a decade, it will eclipse whole categories like defense, education, and social security – combined. With tax revenues already near record highs, the only solution is to reduce government spending.While the lowering of interest rates appears to be an alternative solution, this isn’t possible with the current levels of government spending and borrowing. The only way the Treasury can attract savers to lend it the trillions of dollars it needs is if it offers to pay higher interest rates.If the Federal Reserve artificially pushes interest rates back down, it will reignite inflation. And even that will only work in the short term. Once savers see that inflation is going higher, they will demand higher interest rates from the Treasury to compensate for their lost purchasing power.Congress needs to take this situation seriously and drastically curtail spending. The current appropriations fight is the perfect opportunity to put America back on a path to fiscal sanity. Failing to do so at this late stage just might lose the last chance we have to turn this battleship around.Eventually, your momentum will take you over the falls. Let’s hope Congress acts before it gets that far.Emmress Ann Harpole, 75, of Hilo died July 29 at home. Born in Molokai, dhe was a retired prep cook for the former Isle’s Café. Private services.

eugeneweekly_2023_19,"We ve got issues. Whenever Donald Trump spews his documentable falsehoods, or awkwardly edits a weather map, or tells his supporters that up is down, more reasonable voters tend to take a step back, look at the facts, and lament that his adoring fans could be so willingly duped just because he shares a partisan affiliation with them. Why, then, do so many progressive voters similarly take rhetoric from their own politicians to heart in much the same way? Rep. Paul Holvey has been battling a spirited recall effort, and in his desperation to avoid being subject to an election, he has stretched the truth, perverted his record and simply lied about how we landed here. Since he was appointed into his position in a safe Democratic seat in 2004, Holvey has never had to face a serious challenge, nor had to worry much about activating voters. His “District Updates” are lists of accomplishments that look very much like every other Democratic lawmaker’s “District Update” coming out of the Legislature; that’s not bad, but it’s not particularly remarkable, either. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. A recall election, though, gives voters an opportunity to consider Holvey’s record apart from the noise and hubbub that comes with a presidential-year primary or general election. It offers both sides an opportunity to make their case to voters on a fair and level playing field without the advantage of incumbency, and let voters have the final say. And it provides an opportunity for Holvey to answer for the documentably false claims he’s made: Holvey claims that his tanking of a bill to provide cannabis workers with organizing rights was due to his impulse to “ask questions” which brought up unanswered concerns.But anyone who watched the hearing for the bill (HB 3183 would note that Holvey did not in fact ask any questions, even to national labor experts who traveled from out of state to have that discourse. He neither questioned nor even responded to supporters of the bill for months previous, despite the legislation being available to him. Instead, Holvey alludes to a memo from his Legislative Counsel’s office that even he seems to be confused as to the timeline on: In last week’sEugene Weeklyarticle, he is referred to as having both had the memo in hand while also still waiting for it when he diverted the bill to be killed! Holvey has also grown accustomed to blaming Legislative Counsel for the death of HB 3183,stating:“Our Legislative Counsel confirmed twice that the proposed legislation was in fact preempted by federal law and would not be legal.” Except that’s a craven falsehood: Legislative Counsel was careful to admonish Holvey that they could only postulate about arguments against it: “… absent judicial guidance on this issue, we cannot predict with certainty how the NLRB or a court would ultimately decide.” Of course, despite Holvey’s averring that“Asking questions is foundational to the job of being a state representative,” that seems only to be a hurdle when it’s pro-worker legislation. In fact, Holvey has a long and comfortable history of ignoring legal scrutiny when big business is on the line: In a day-long special session in 2012, he voted to allow the state to enter into 30-year contracts to cover certain liabilities of big corporations mere hours after the bill was introduced. In 2013 he bucked Legislative Counsel guidance to support deep pension cuts for public employees, which was reversed after a costly legal battle. In 2019, he led the effort to slash pensions again, still against the available legal advice. But these issues (and others deserve more attention than on an editorial page or in a down-ticket race in a presidential primary. They should be thoroughly untangled, deliberated and placed before voters in a special recall election. Whatever our vote may be in such an election, we should hopefully agree that our elected officials ought not to fear an examination of their performance. We should agree that taking an elected official’s record and placing it before voters — outside the distraction of up-ticket contests — is a tool that has its place in a democracy. And hopefully we should all agree that when a politician shakes his fist and declares any scrutiny against him to be “fake news” (or some equivalent term , we have a duty as voters to take a step back, look at the facts dispassionately, and say: “Is it?”"
suffolknewsherald_2023_9,"Published 6:23 pm Tuesday, June 27, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldWe’re just as excited as the kiddos about Suffolk’s annual Stars & Stripes Spectacular on Independence Day.The festivities begin at 5:30 p.m. Constant’s Wharf Park & Marina behind the Hilton Garden Inn, with music by Rocky 7 from 6 to 9 p.m., then fireworks over the Nansemond River at 9 p.m. It’s one of our favorite celebrations of the year in Suffolk.Amid the fun, we urge our readers to remember the reason we celebrate the Fourth of July. Neighboring Smithfield offers such an opportunity. The volunteers who run the historic 1750 Isle of Wight Courthouse on Main Street will do a public reading of the Declaration of Independence at 6:30 p.m. Sunday, preceding that community’s fireworks after dark. We encourage you to round up friends and family and head 30 minutes north for an entertaining, educational experience.From its second paragraph, the Declaration of Independence eloquently states the principles that have guided the world’s greatest democratic experiment, one not without its flaws and shortcomings but that has defied long odds and remains resilient even as new threats arise daily.When our forefathers severed ties with England in 1776, it was a declaration of war for which the signers paid dearly. They enunciated this inspiring principle, the words of which are as true today as they were then:We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.Next Tuesday, America celebrates the 247th anniversary of the document that served as the prelude to the establishment of our government. While all of us can find fault with certain government leaders and policies, few of us, if pressed, would trade our system for any other in the world.For more than two centuries, the United States has been an example of freedom, self-government and justice. If they were still around to assess their creation, this experiment in self-government has likely succeeded far beyond the wildest expectations of our nation’s founders.But let us not be complacent. We must remain vigilant against forces of oppression and intolerance. We must not stop striving to become a better version of ourselves. Freedom must be exercised and defended by those who enjoy it.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2023_48,"Poet, writer, and activist Hannah Drake said something on , two weeks ago, during the moments after the mass shooting that is on my mind today. She said, “Louisville it’s okay to just pause for a minute. The meeting will still take place. The email will get sent. The phone call will be made. All the stuff will still be there tomorrow and the day after that. It’s okay to just sit for a minute.”It is this quote, amidst all the other stuff I’ve read and digested over the last couple of weeks, that I keep coming back to. It’s a refrain in my head when I get rushed at work, and I reflect on how easy it is to let myself get bogged down in the mess of simple day-to-day living. I’m reaching the point where a pause is not only necessary, but mandatory. Sometimes, when we’re in the grind, we are hustling to meet the goals of an organization or ourselves and forget to check our own gas meters.As I clocked in my 70th hour last week, I felt it. The heavy shoulders, the desire to stay in bed — despite commitments that normally are enjoyable but seemed like one more thing on top of a long week­ — came crashing in on me this past weekend.I’m tired. But it’s not just me.We all experienced a collective trauma recently. And every day in America, we are reinforced with the knowledge that that trauma will be repeated. Time will not slow down. Work will still go on, and we’re expected to “suck it up, buttercup” and perform.Fuck. That.Drake’s advice is the right advice for this time, and anytime. The world doesn’t collapse when we pause. We should have learned that lesson during the COVID shutdown. When we spent those two very scary but quiet and eerily calm weeks at home, the world didn’t stop when we stopped. The air grew cleaner. Waterways became clearer, and instead of cars, we could hear the world around us. It was a communal deep breath, and aside from the circumstances of the virus, we all needed that moment.So this week, my editor’s note is this: stop moving. Read Hannah Drake’s words. It’s fine for just a bit to stop doing.We’ve convinced ourselves that “moving and shaking” gets us ahead, and we’re stumbling our foolish lives toward disaster. We’re making mistakes in places we shouldn’t make mistakes, angry with each other, killing each other, and in the process, ourselves. On top of it all, we are just not enjoying life, and I’m making that change a priority.I’m slowing down. Some things might not get done as quickly, and y’all might have to wait an extra minute for a concert announcement, but you’ll still get it. I promise.I’m making this claim to say, I want you to join me in ‘just’ a pause. ‘Just’ a moment so that we both can breathe, look at each other without the whir of movement, and acknowledge that we’re still here. “The meeting will still take place. The email will get sent. The phone call will be made. All the stuff will still be there tomorrow and the day after that.”So, just sit for a minute, reflect on Drake’s very wise words. I’ll be sitting, pausing, resting with you.• ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_154,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In 2010, the Affordable Care Act emerged as a ray of hope for the 64 million women in the United States now entitled to no-cost preventive services. With their health insurance, it promised no-cost access to birth control, a vital component of health care.This pledge was a significant milestone in the struggle for affordable contraception. No-cost contraception empowers people to make informed choices about their reproductive health, enhancing their educational opportunities, career prospects and economic stability.It also saves money. In the first year of the ACA, for example, women saved $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket expenses; per person, that’s $255 each.But this promise has yet to be fully realized. Despite the ACA’s mandate and repeated government directives emphasizing free access to all FDA-approved contraceptives, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have not fully adhered to these guidelines.Now, in 2023, birth control is still inaccessible for many people who need it. Countless women are struggling to obtain no-cost birth control that they are legally entitled to. The “Secret Shopper” report by Power to Decide and the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform reveals a grim reality.The report exposes how insurance companies nationwide routinely violate the ACA’s requirement for plans to cover all FDA-approved contraception options with no out-of-pocket costs. These violations have left an untold number of women still paying out-of-pocket costs for birth control.This noncompliance has far-reaching consequences. It hampers innovation in reproductive health care and exacerbates health inequities. The impact of these denials falls hardest on historically marginalized communities and those struggling to make ends meet.For those facing challenges in accessing no-cost birth control, help is available. CoverHer.org, run by the National Women’s Law Center, assists individuals struggling to get the coverage they are entitled to under the law. This resource empowers people to advocate for their health rights and ensures that the promise of the ACA is fulfilled.The federal government must act swiftly to ensure coverage for all FDA-approved contraceptives lacking therapeutic equivalent generics with firm penalties for noncompliance. Therapeutic equivalent generics are FDA-approved drugs that are identical in active ingredients, dosage form and administration route, meeting stringent quality and safety standards. The FDA’s Orange Book lists these drugs, guiding insurers and providers in recognizing interchangeable medications for optimal patient care.The denial of no-cost birth control is not just a policy issue; it is a profound betrayal of trust and a flagrant violation of people’s rights. It is an affront to reproductive autonomy and agency and a stark reminder of the systemic injustices that continue to plague our society.But there is hope. Together, we have the power to bring about change. The struggle for no-cost birth control is a collective one, requiring our active engagement. We can raise our voices, assert our rights, and stand in solidarity with all those still denied access. We can support resources like CoverHer.org, and play an active role in shaping a future where everyone has the autonomy to control their destiny.The Pentagon is in the midst of an enormously expensive program aimed at building a new generation of nuclear-armed missiles, bombers, and submarines, at a cost of at least $2 trillion over the next three decades. The plan is both dangerous and unnecessary."
suffolknewsherald_2023_245,"Published 2:19 pm Friday, July 14, 2023ByStaff ReportsBy Drew VarnerWith the Fourth of July now behind us, it is crucial to reflect on the significance of our independence and sovereignty. Safeguarding our liberties is a responsibility we must uphold, as America faces psychological attacks on multiple fronts.We find ourselves amidst what experts refer to as fifth generation warfare, specifically information warfare. Distinguished researchers from Virginia, Drs. Jill and Robert Malone, are diligently studying and documenting this fifth Generation Warfare in their forthcoming book titled “PsyWars: The 21st Century Battlefield.”According to the Malones, fifth-gen warfare builds upon strategies and tactics of asymmetric and insurgent warfare, integrating both conventional and unconventional military methods, including the exploitation of political, religious, and social causes. This modern form of warfare leverages the internet, social media and the 24-hour news cycle to manipulate the cognitive biases of individuals and organizations. It can be conducted by various groups, organized or decentralized, and led by nation states, non-state actors, organizations, NGOs, or even individuals. An essential characteristic of fifth gen warfare is its concealed nature, aiming to disrupt and defeat opponents by instilling new cognitive biases.This style of warfare employs a combination of truth and falsehood to achieve a particular outcome—propaganda. The intention is to use falsehoods to persuade and weaponize the American mind, aligning it with the agenda of those in control. Presently, this psychological warfare permeates various aspects of American society, including schools, social media, television, mainstream media,and involves foreign agents, pseudo statesmen, federal government agencies and wealthy individuals.It is our duty to resist this psychological warfare and safeguard the minds of our children from being weaponized. Today’s warfare differs significantly from conflicts of the past, and we should not expect it to conform to traditional notions. A larger conflict looms over America, and we are not the only militarily powerful nation in the world. China, in particular, has expanded its influence into our vicinity, seeking our land, resources and economy. In a speech to the Chinese Communist Party in 2003, retired People’s Liberation Army General and former Minister of National Defense Chi Haotian revealed China’s long-term strategy of colonizing America, rather than destroying it. He also proclaimed the Chinese as the superior race. Although the CIA’s Chinese pivot under President Obama shifted intelligence operations to focus on Asia, it raises questions about whether it was enacted in time. This issue is crucial for our state’s survival.It is important to note that this is not a matter of Republican or Democraic debate; it is a national security concern. The Chinese Communist Party has infiltrated America with their psyop operatives and exert influence over certain statesmen, whom they utilize as puppets in the information war. Vigilance and critical thinking are vital in questioning prevailing narratives. It is also worth keeping a watchful eye on the Suffolk community as well, because the fight for our sovereignty will end within the community itself.Drew Varner researcher and writer who resides in Suffolk.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

To be sure, just as today, there were nightmares parents dared not consider and dreams to which young girls held against all hope.That was the setting against which the New York Sun’s Francis Pharcellus Church answered a plaintive letter from 8-year-old Virginia O’Hanlon in what would become perhaps the most famous unsigned editorial ever to appear in a newspaper.We reprint it here with great respect for 8-year-old newspaper readers and even a bit of reverence for veteran newsmen like Church whose typewriters no longer declaim on their — and our — behalf.DEAR EDITOR: I am 8 years old.Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus.Papa says, ‘If you see it in THE SUN it’s so.’Please tell me the truth; is there a Santa Claus?VIRGINIA O’HANLON.115 WEST NINETY-FIFTH STREET.VIRGINIA, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men’s or children’s, are little. In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.Yes, VIRGINIA, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus. It would be as dreary as if there were no VIRGINIAS. There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies! You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that’s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.You may tear apart the baby’s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, VIRGINIA, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives, and he lives forever. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_52,"Published 5:22 pm Friday, May 5, 2023ByStaff ReportsThe “reality” is we are a part of time and we can’t do anything about its slow or its fast passing, which many of us feel is happening these days.A third of 2023 is already behind us.While going through old papers I came across one marked Y2K when much of the world was waiting expectantly to see how the first day and year of a new millennium could change our lives. I recently asked someone born about that time what she knew about Y2K. Her answer was “Y2K? What’s that?”It begs the question: How important is history? What should we know about the past and how can it help us solve problems in the present day or in the future?Time may have removed many of the memories about that historical moment, but a generation born and educated since then may know little of its history. Instead, this younger generation has succeeded in unwrapping a whole new lifestyle.An older generation knew Y2K very well. For younger readers, Y2K took place at midnight 1999. Few of us knew about the legitimate concern of how it could affect complex computerized programs and timings but what we were hearing produced enough fear that people bought extra supplies and some filled their bathtubs with water. We were relieved the next morning to wake up just like we always had, except for the start of a new millennium.If we so desired, we could look back at history to see something about those times, the years from 1000 A.D.-1999 A.D. For some of us today, 1999, the old millennium does not seem that long ago.I briefly ‘relieved’ Y2K as I looked back at those old papers. I saw when all seemed normal, we settled back into our routine with little excitement or thought about the new millennium. How wrong we were.At my age, 95, I sometimes find myself immersed in memories. My reverie caught up with me when I realized the 23 years of events in this new millennium could fill a book.The first was called 9/11. We were raped when foreign powers blew up our Twin Towers and seriously damaged other properties. One act of heroism by two young men took their lives but spared a part of our country. Since then the media has had a constant line of compelling situations to report — political news, the space rocket explosions, massive weather conditions, shootings in schools and other places like malls, hospitals and grocery stores, major changes in our culture and even in some words in our language, such as the coronavirus that sparked fear in many. Not all fear is bad. It can serve as an alert. That is one reality of time.Now back to Time and history. We know there have been about 6000 years of recorded history or six previous millennia. The Jewish history keepers recorded it. Bible readers will remember several stories of millennial changes and happenings in those historic times, events that have taken place since God created this world. We are told how people lived and died and a little about the future and the world’s ending.Many of the players in those dramas are just like us. They may have listened to and followed God’s leadership for a short time, then decided they no longer wanted to live under His rules. Sadly, we are also reaping a harvest of weeds, some poisonous thoughts have been planted in today’s world.We have not learned our history lessons. The Bible is God’s Word from Genesis 1:1 to the end of Revelation, He created this world and all that is in it. He always pronounced judgment on sinful people.John’s Gospel tells us the story that after dying for our sins Jesus left earth, but sent the Holy Spirit, that great power of God, to indwell us and teach us how to live for God. We are reminded we will all give an account when we leave this world and stand in God’s presence.Jesus also said He will return and set up a divine Kingdom on earth. We don’t know if that time is near, but world conditions seem to indicate it could be. We do know how Israel forgot God, was judged, and lost their land. It is more important to be ready today than was necessary when we experienced Y2K. Let’s get out our Bibles and get on our knees because this may be when we need to be more ready than we needed to be for Y2K.Myrtle V.

philinquirer_2023_10,"Santos fibs about his religious background aren t nearly as serious as his other lies. As a Jew, I think they re more like a joke. George Santos, who will take the congressional oath of office after the U.S. House of Representatives elects a speaker, appears to be a serial liar. The newly elected GOP representative from Queens and Long Island lied about hiseducation, his job history, andeven his charity activity. He’s nowunder local and federal investigation. Of course, Santos should face the full force of the law for any crimes he committed. And he should also apologize for falsely claiming to have attended Baruch College and New York University, which insults people who actually put in the effort to obtain degrees there. But lying about his alleged Jewish ancestry? Meh. Yes, Santos falsely asserted that hismaternal grandparents were Jews who fled Europeduring World War II. But Santos’ fibs about his religious background aren’t nearly as serious as his other lies. As a Jew, I think they’re more like a joke. And the joke comes to us courtesy of comedian Lenny Bruce, who famously quipped that “if you live in New York, you’re Jewish.” Not literally, of course, but culturally. To Bruce, “Jewish” referred to a state of mind and a set of habits — not to a lineage or ancestry. Anyone could claim it. But, no surprise, people don’t flood to make false claims about Jewish heritage. For most of history, any association with Judaism was more likely to hold you back than to push you forward. Many Jewschanged their nameswhen they came to the United States, to avoid the sting of discrimination. Other Americans were falsely charged with having Jewish ancestry, which was an effective way to malign them. “For most of history, any association with Judaism was more likely to hold you back than to push you forward.” Did you know that Franklin D. Roosevelt was Jewish? Of course, he wasn’t. But that’s what his antisemitic enemies said in the 1930s. Roosevelt’s real name, they said, was Rosenfeld. (For good measure, they also called FDR’sNew Deal the “Jew Deal.” Abraham Lincoln? Jewish. Harry Truman? Also Jewish. Ditto Bill Clinton. All lies, of course, but you can find them on any number of antisemitic websites today. You’ll also discover that Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci, and their efforts to promote COVID-19 vaccines, are part of a Jewish plot to spread disease and control the globe. In Russia, meanwhile, state propagandists have charged that Ukraine is under the control of Nazis, who are secret Jews. Never mind that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is openly Jewish. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters last May that Adolf Hitler “had Jewish blood, too,” and that “the most ardent antisemites are usually Jews.” Against this background, Santos’ lies about his Jewish ancestry seem relatively innocuous. He didn’t slur anyone for being Jewish; to the contrary, he eagerly claimed the identity for himself. “I’m supposed to care, if in an age of rabid antisemitism, a politician wants to join my tribe?” aboard member of the Republican Jewish Coalitionaskedthe New York Times last month. “Not at the forefront of my concerns.” It’s not at the forefront of mine, either. And I also wonder why most Jews who are blasting Santos didn’t make as big a deal when questions arose over progressive New York State Sen. Julia Salazar’sclaims that her father was Jewish. Part of the reason is that Santos is in the U.S. Congress, which is a much higher-profile position. But another reason is good old-fashioned politics:Most Jews are Democrats, so we’re more likely to indict a conservative fibber than a liberal one. » READ MORE:Will George Santos or reality win in 2023? | Will Bunch Newsletter Let’s also remember that Santos and Salazar aren’t the only politicians to misrepresent their ethnic or racial heritage. During her career as a law professor, which includedeight years at Penn, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass. claimed — with little evidence — that she was Native American. She later took aDNA test to “prove” the same— although the results, which showed her Native American ancestry may come from 10 generations in the past, led tobacklash from the right and left. None of that made it OK for Donald Trump to give her the racist nickname “Pocahontas,” of course. And to her credit, Warren apologized for the DNA test. But why does it matter who we “really” are? Isn’t it more important what we do? I’m much more interested in finding out how Santos was able tolend his own campaign $700,000— after reporting no assets and a $55,000 salary in 2020 — than I am in figuring out if he’s Jewish. The whole line of inquiry reminds me of another classic Jewish joke, about the Jew who is shipwrecked on a desert island and builds two synagogues: the one he attends, andthe one he would never step foot in. Jews don’t agree about anything, including what makes us Jewish in the first place. So let’s stop worrying about whether George Santos is. Jonathan Zimmerman teaches education and history at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of “Whose America?: Culture Wars in the Public Schools,” which was published in a revised 20th-anniversary edition in 2022 by the University of Chicago Press."
eugeneweekly_2023_35,"We ve got issues. One of the most common questions I get asked when speaking about the work of SquareOne Villages is some version of Field of Dreams: “If you build it, they will come.” Unlike the movie, however, it is not seen as desirable. “Won’t we just attract more homeless people if we make it easier for them to live here?” I have been asked something along that line in more than 10 states and 30 or 40 different communities. There are so many problems with the question that it is hard to know where to start. It assumes, for instance, that unhoused people have both the ability and the desire to move. The reality is that most people, whether housed or unhoused, have a hometown where they prefer to live. And second, moving requires a certain amount of resources which unhoused people do not have. Yes, there are those individuals who are not tethered to any place and may freely move about on a whim, but those are not the majority of the unhoused, not by a long shot. A second problem with the question is, every community cannot simultaneously attract people from the other, at least not that would make any statistical difference. The attraction theory only works in one direction, from somewhere to somewhere. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. From where do people think these vast numbers of unhoused people are coming? Not California; it has the highest number of unhoused people in the country. (More on that in a moment. If you know anything about Portland and Seattle, the unhoused certainly are not leaving those cities in large numbers. Maybe from states like Alabama and Mississippi where poverty rates are higher? Turns out their housing costs are also much lower and hence even people with low income are still able to afford housing. The only place that seems likely for people to leave when they lose their housing is rural communities where there are few support services. In fact, however, even rural communities in Oregon are now discovering that they too have growing numbers of unhoused people who call their town home. A third problem with the question is just the built-in bias against people without housing. Substitute “people of color,” “Jews” or “LGBTQ” for “homeless” in that question and you see the problem. Why is bias against people without housing any more acceptable than bias based on race, religion or sexual orientation? This kind of us/them thinking, which sees the unhoused as “the other” rather than as part of the community, further stigmatizes the unhoused, adding an additional burden to their already overburdened lives. While I typically respond to the question with some version of the above, I have not been able to cite any good studies to refute the assumption behind it, that unhoused people move to where life will be easier without housing. That brings us back to California, a state, it is often assumed, that attracts the unhoused. People just point to the statistics — 30 percent of the unhoused in the U.S. are in California, more than double it should have with just 12 percent of the total population. Obviously they must be doing something to make it easier for unhoused people to live there! A new study from the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative of the University of California, San Francisco, reveals that not to be the case at all. In a survey of 3,200 unhoused people in California, selected to provide a representative sample of the unhoused population, researchers found that 90 percent of the unhoused in California were from California when they lost their housing. Further, 75 percent remained in the county where they lost their housing. To put it differently, there are about 171,000 unhoused people in California. Of that, 10 percent came from out of state. That means of the 550,000 unhoused people in the U.S., only 17,000 chose to move to California. And how many left California? Hard to know, but it’s easy to imagine that just as many left California to be closer to relatives, or where they might find a job or cheaper housing. The point which this study should make clear is that the vast majority of the unhoused remain in the state and likely in the community where they lost their housing. The idea that “if you build it, they will come,” may be true for baseball and movies, but when it comes to shelter, or better, affordable housing for the unhoused, it is no field of dreams — just the right thing to do.

A field with such longevity has clearly adapted to technological advances, the evolution of political and economic systems, and the rise and fall of nation states. So, what’s new today?As editor of the Weekly Intelligence Notes — the Association of Former Intelligence Officers’ online news magazine (www.afio.com — I spend countless hours weekly curating news from around the globe about intelligence: busted spy rings in Europe, classified document leaks in the U.S., CIA diversity initiatives, Chinese operators’ attempts to get into Five Eyes partners’ knickers, movies depicting real cloak-and-dagger operations from WWI to Abbottabad, espionage history back to the Roman Empire. Here’s my optic.Cyberespionage. I frequently encounter news on Indian hacks of Pakistani military systems, Israeli cyber strikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure, Russian penetrations of U.S. systems, North Korean computer attacks on European allies. Stealing secrets and executing covert action (sabotage via computer code is now a well-established arena. When I left the CIA a decade ago, it was already a thing; now it isthething. At Langley, one of the newest career tracks is Cyber Operations Officer under the newest C-suite level component, The Directorate of Digital Innovation — established in 2015 and currently run by my old boss, a traditional spook, Jennifer Ewbank (check out her public addresses online .Open Source Intelligence (OSINT .The OSINT Foundation ( www.osintfoundation.com was established last year to develop intelligence-communitywide standards and professionalize the field, but some still debate whether or not it is “intelligence.” So … what is it? Well … the trade-craft is learned online and, increasingly, in college classes. Targeted information is sensitive, but not classified, and is found in publicly available data, not stolen from safes. (It is, however, hard to identify or locate or requires sophisticated analysis — reverse searches, photo interpretation, digital forensics — to reveal its worth. The CIA now has Open Source Exploitation Officers, but even nongovernment players are doing remarkable work in the field. For example, in 2020, Amsterdam-based Bellingcat (www.bellingcat.com remotely uncovered the identity of assassins in Russia’s domestic security service (FSB after they poisoned an opposition leader with a nerve agent. (Check out the 2021 book “We Are Bellingcat: Global Crime, Online Sleuths, and the Bold Future of News.” Even developing nations can build a world-class OSINT capability, and for less money than building satellites, communications intercept gear, or a professional spy corps.Artificial Intelligence.In my spy balloon column ( Tribune-Herald, Mar 12 , I noted how intelligence applications for new technology surface quickly. AI is no different. In September, the CIA announced the launch of a ChatGPT equivalent aimed at “finding needles in the needle field,” and NSA announced the opening of an AI Security Center. The months prior were filled with MI6 and NSA leaders’ proclamations on the utility of AI in their trade, and concern that AI could eat into the jobs of professional intelligence analysts while elevating covert influence campaigns to a new level (mind this warning as we approach our presidential election . In June, Israel’s Shin Bet (akin to the FBI announced development of its own generative AI platform (like Google’s Bard to identify and neutralize internal threats. (Machines can exploit complex patterns that humans cannot detect. AI-augmented photo interpretation, including for satellite imagery, is a logical next step, if not already extant.Deep fakes.They continue to improve, get harder to detect, and get easier to produce by anyone with basic skills and a laptop. Intelligence applications are only limited by the imagination — counterterrorism influence operations, building a NOC’s cover, framing a gifted foreign intel officer to justify expulsion — and detection methods can have limited impact. An image cannot be “unseen,” and once a target audience buys into a narrative and is whipped into a frenzy, course reversal can be difficult, irrespective of the technological wizardry exposing afraud.Biometrics.Privacy concerns limit this technology’s rollout in the U.S., but not in other nations. Facial recognition tools on Shanghai’s streets facilitate control of society (monitoring law compliance and Party loyalty, preventing undesirable elements — including spies — from plying their trade.

How would you feel about him jeopardizing the lives of your valiant soldier serving far far away?It is an unforgivable sin he has committed against the people and the nation simply because he is such a colossal buffoon, he does not comprehend in any way, shape or form what the Presidential Records Act was passed for. He is an ignoramus that is almost impossible to describe.Trump quite literally did not know the function of NATO. He did not know what its purpose was or worse still, how it is financed. Somehow Republicans have almost universally forgotten that it is not good for the nation to have someone far worse than Benedict Arnold as president.Both Trump and the troglodytes who elected him are the greatest threat to democracy the world has ever faced.They embrace Trump’s treason. They lie about his collusion with Vladimir Putin.They lie about Trump’s record.The simple fact of the matter is that Trump along with others in their disgusting party has taught them that there is no lie that they will not welcome with open arms so long as it is soiled with some imaginary dig at Democrats.The Republicans who dared to question or criticize Trump have either left the party or were run out of it. This includes Steve Schmidt, Nicole Wallace, Joe Scarborough, George Will, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, among many others.What modern Republicans have demonstrated over and again is that they have absolutely zero regard for the truth or facts. Any rumor, any bloviation of any kind coming from the mysterious Q is considered solid gold truth when it is nothing but puerile bullshit concocted by some anonymous asshole.This crisis is caused solely by the brazen ignorance and stupidity of the seditious Republican Party which specialize in gaslighting the nation about the January 6th riots being ‘legitimate political discourse’ despite it maiming and killing police officers they claim to support, except their unions!The full horror of the Republican Party is almost impossible to fathom when we see the most vulgar and disgusting excuses made by their political leaders to excuse their mind-boggling equivocations.Lindsey Graham valiantly got up on This Week without so much as reading the indictment of Trump to proclaim both Hillary and Bill Clinton to be worse than Trump because something something potato.Trump is now charged with 70 felony counts, 37 of which are entirely charged after his administration and one undeniable fact that is most inconvenient for Republicans is that 100% of the witnesses against Trump are in point of actual fact, Republicans.Trump does not care if he further beclowns the reputation of the United States. What he proved was that there are no less than 75 million morons in the United States who think another four years of reckless abandonment for truth and fact is what we need. Trump told over 35,000 documented lies in his criminal presidency and Republicans want to act like he did anything that a corpse could have done if we elected it instead of Trump.Isaac Asimov presciently wrote, “There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.”How many more times must we endure the banal platitude from Republican scum that iterates, ‘Well they might have their book learning but they ain’t got no common sense.’ Or some other nauseating buffoonery that shows what a failure our educational system has become because Republicans have now adopted the sophistry that ‘well wut about what the parents think should be taught?’The fact that Marsha Blackburn and Tommy Tuberville are Republicans is all one needs to mention to prove their flat imbecility. In all of my interactions with Republicans in my 53 years, I have seen several universal truths among all of them; they are either stupid, broken inside or outright evil and the people they elect tend to be the latter.What is most sickening is the many Trump acolytes in office who to a man and woman — save Mitt Romney — didn’t even bother to even read the indictment presented by 12 Floridians before they came out claiming Trump was innocent but even that wasn’t the most disgusting part of their abominable lies.The absolute most disgusting ploy by these entirely amoral bastards was the preposterous claim that the Justice Department didn’t go after Joe Biden for keeping classified documents!Every single one of these Grendels knows that there is a difference between classified documents, secret documents, Top Secret, Top Secret Compartmentalized Information, and 5 Eyes security which is reserved *only* for the heads of state of Canada, England, France, The United States and Australia.Trump had every crown jewel of top secret compartmentalized data and 5 Eyes documents he could steal out of the White House and if that were not bad enough, then he lied to both the National Archives and the FBI to conceal the documents he stole which he falsely believes he is entitled to under the Presidential Records Act!Hell Spiro Agnew was caught taking cash money inside the White House and he wasn’t that stupid!We’ve never seen a crook as big as Trump in any office in American history and it’s a wonder that we didn’t suffer a worse fate than that traitor selling us out for the imaginary crime of stealing an election he thought he won but lost, badly.The documents he stole were his recompense and revenge against the 83 million people who voted for Joe Biden and if you still harbor any doubt whatsoever about Trump selling those stolen documents then ask yourself what happened to the documents he was fumbling through on tape with two authors writing Mark Meadows’ book and his secretary?Trump is the one who signed the law that mishandling classified documents to be a punishable by up to ten years in prison. Where are those documents, hmm?If there is any such thing as justice in America, Trump will get ten years in prison for that and every single one of his seditious acolytes trying to excuse his crimes against the republic will be voted out the next election post haste.Subscribe to LEO Daily newsletters.|NewsBreak (coming soon |||||*** ."
suffolknewsherald_2023_117,"Published 5:17 pm Tuesday, February 21, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardSuffolk property owners should lament yet another defeat for legislation that would help ease the financial burden of school construction.A bill that would have let cities and counties ask their voters to approve a sales tax surcharge to finance school construction or renovation died in the House Finance Committee after approval by the state Senate. Authorization of up to a one-cent sales tax increase has been considered repeatedly by the General Assembly in recent years, to no avail.As it stands, the estimated $25 billion required to fund school construction currently needed will continue to fall entirely on the backs of property owners via real estate and personal property taxes.Supervisor Dick Grice in neighboring Isle of Wight County made a sound but unpersuasive appeal to the House Finance Committee.A new elementary school, estimated to cost about $60 million, will cause his county to raise its “already high” real estate tax rate by another 8 cents per $100 of assessed value, Grice said.Grice emphasized that lawmakers would not be raising taxes, but rather just giving a community’s voters a chance to assess one.“We say schools are a local responsibility; that’s what this bill does,” said state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, the bill’s sponsor.A sales tax would allow renters, of whom there are many with kids in public schools, to help fund new or renovated schools. Also, those who live elsewhere but commute to Suffolk for work or visit for pleasure would contribute any time they purchased a meal or tank of gas inside the county.Those who own real estate would still shoulder most of the responsibility, but anything to lessen their burden is welcome.Under the failed legislation, the additional sales tax could have been imposed for no more than 20 years and only be used for capital projects.The bill died on a 4-1 vote along party lines, with Republicans opposed. It had passed the Senate with bipartisan support.The Commission on School Construction and Modernization reports that more than half of K-12 school buildings in Virginia are older than 50 years, so a day of reckoning is coming, especially in growing cities like Suffolk.Lawmakers owe localities flexibility in funding essential capital expenses like new schools.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Parents filled out a registration form on which they indicated either the nearest formerly all-white school or the nearest formerly all-Black school to which they wished the child to be assigned. If overcrowding resulted at a particular school due to the choices made, preference was given to pupils residing closest to the school. If any pupil is not admitted to the school of the parent’s first choice, the parent will be given an opportunity to make a second choice of the next nearest formerly all-white or the next nearest formerly all-Black school. “School personnel will neither favor nor penalize any pupil because of the choice he makes in the exercise of his decision under this freedom of choice plan. Transportation will be provided for pupils to the school of their choice on a nondiscriminatory basis.”In July, Suffolk reported 110 students applied for transfer to another school under the freedom of choice plan. Suffolk students were required to submit a school of choice form prior to the end of school in June. Requests were fairly evenly distributed over the grades. Grades 1, 5, 6, 8 and 12 were given priority. According to the plan, full desegregation would be achieved by the 1967 school year.Also in the summer of 1965, Operation Head Start began in Nansemond County. The purpose of the program was to provide opportunity for children who would attend first grade in the fall to experience readiness and orientation activities relating to school life. The program was particularly designed for “culturally-deprived” children.The case against poll tax was hotly debated throughout the late ’60s. In March 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that poll tax was unconstitutional. The literacy test required in locations was also ruled discriminatory.Overseas, the war in Vietnam blazed on. Every day, reports of air strikes, downed aircraft and MIA/KIA troops were highlighted on the front page. Air strikes were launched from air bases as well as from aircraft carriers. In one battle in March, 19 Marine helicopters took part; all 19 were hit with ground fire. Photos often accompanied the reports and showed the thick swampy jungles where troops were fighting. In July 1965, more than 8,000 U.S. Marines entered Vietnam in one week, bringing the number of troops in the country at that time to nearly 60,000.On June 4, 1965, Edward White became the first man to do a space walk. This was a key step in America’s mission to put a man on the moon.Locally, business thrived and the city grew. Suffolk instated a 2% sales tax. Reports were due by the 20th of each month from merchants. Merchants who made their reports on time were entitled to 3% of the collected tax for acting as collector. Merchants who file reports late, however, were subject to a 5% penalty in addition to one-half of 1% interest per month on the unreported amount. Several merchants reported customers refusing to buy goods when met with the tax. Others said the customers came prepared with the extra pennies needed.IkeMatina, one of theMunchkins in “The Wizard of Oz” died, Sept. 15, 1965. Matina and his brother lived their adult lives in Suffolk and are buried at Bethlehem Christian Church Cemetery.One local farmer discovered a horticultural oddity. “Esmond W. Sadler Jr. thought it a bit unusual, and you may agree that indeed it is. After all, it’s not every day you come across a pretty good size beech tree that has two small holly trees growing from its trunk.” Sadler was clearing off the back part of a lot he owned just past Reid’s Ferry off Route 10 when he came across the oddity. Sadler’s wife, Mona, described it very well in a note to the News-Herald: “We have a rather unusual tree growing on our lot. My husband thought you might like to know about it. In fact, I guess you would say it’s two trees in one. It’s a good size beech tree with two small holly trees growing off the same trunk. It’s hard to believe, but we would be glad for you to see it.” A News-Herald reporter was glad to see it and he, too, was surprised to see holly branches protruding from the trunk of a beech tree. Sadler said he figured the beech tree to be about 10 years old. He had no idea how the holly joined up with the beech.Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

eugeneweekly_2023_62,"We ve got issues. The year 2022 ended with the Grim Reaper having overseen the highest number of mass shootings and resulting carnage in lives lost and survivors maimed than ever before. The country is now averaging two mass shootings per day. No other nation comes close. How did we get to this dark place, where the sacrifice of schoolchildren in their classrooms has been normalized and their grieving parents are even mocked and ridiculed by cruel pundits who broadcast lies questioning whether the attacks on their loved ones even happened? Thus, those in positions of power deny reality, and, worse, look the other way and refuse to take action to strike at the roots of the daily bloodshed in order to eradicate it like the cancer it is. I have a Canadian friend who is constantly being asked why Americans won’t act to save their children and the numerous other innocent victims of such repetitive and ritualistic slaughter. She is understandably at a loss to explain. What follows are my answers, derived from years of research, and sober truth about the causes as well as the impediments to the remedies necessary to make America safer for our people. I will begin with the makeover of the Second Amendment by the National Rifle Association and the gun industry, which has created supposed legal impediments to the government’s efforts to regulate the commercial distribution of firearms to the general public. Beginning in the 1980s the NRA began funding seminars and articles which were designed to change two centuries of jurisprudence on the interpretation of the amendment, which had consistently tethered the “right to bear arms“ to its prefatory clause — “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State…” Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. The end result of this project was the novel interpretation that the amendment conferred a personal “right” on the individual to bear arms separate and untethered to a well-regulated militia. Even worse, this scholarship funded by the NRA posited that one of the purposes of the Second Amendment was to arm the citizens so they would have the means to rebel against their own government — i.e., the very constitutional government the Founders had created. There is much mischief in this fabricated narrative, not the least of which is that it purported to “amend” the Constitution without satisfying the process required to do so. Moreover, the contributors to the project were not historians, but lawyers who received funding from the beneficiary of their conclusions — the NRA and its clients, the gun industry. As a former trial attorney and judge, I can verify that in every case wherein an expert proffers an opinion, he or she is cross-examined about the compensation received from the party benefiting from the opinion rendered. Such is relevant to whether the opinion is colored by bias. But I am also not a historian, so I wish to refer the reader to an esteemed historian — Garry Wills — who reviewed and thoroughly discredited the findings and conclusions from this project. (“To Keep and Bear Arms,”by Garry Wills in the Sept. 21, 1995 issue ofThe New York Review of Books. Please consult his scholarly piece on the subject, as it refutes point by point the distorted reformation of history reflected in the body of their work. At one point, Wills complains, “How difficult it is to track down their many ‘misrepresentations.’” This is, unfortunately, what emerges when neophytes pretend to be experts in a field in which they are unqualified. Yet an equally unqualified Supreme Court no doubt relied in part on that fictional re-creation of history. Justice Clarence Thomas stated he was impressed with the literature supporting the conclusion that private gun ownership was protected by the Second Amendment. Thereafter, he and his colleagues in the conservative bloc on the court adopted that narrative in several decisions (e.g.HellerandNew York Rifle & Pistolcases . Ironically, the court instructed lower courts to construe state gun regulations in light of the historical context of the Second Amendment. Let’s examine more deeply the repercussions that have flowed from the faux history cited by the Supreme Court. The idea that the Founders squirreled into the Bill of Rights a right to rebel against the very government establishing a constitutional democracy has in fact resulted in the sale of military weaponry to the general public — because how can rebels prevail in overthrowing their government without having access to equivalent arsenals? Already regulations prohibiting sales of semi-automatic high-powered assault weapons are being challenged as unconstitutional. The basis for possessing firearms has leaped from sporting, hunting and self-defense to insurrections over election results and coups by the losers who need to seize the Capitol and install their preferred form of governance by force of arms. And what is the science to be relied upon for the history — exhuming long-dead white men who created the amendment at issue? Obviously, the weaponry of today is not the single shot muskets wielded in 1776. What would Thomas Jefferson do, pray tell? Judges, law clerks and attorneys are not schooled in history per se, and this deficiency is demonstrated in the shoddy work that has already emanated from such amateurish forays into the minds of the deceased men from centuries ago. Am I alone in my dismay over Justice Samuel Alito’s pronouncement that his search of history discovered no hint that women had any rights in the autonomy or privacy of their own bodies? Is this not a formula for chiseling ignorance in stone for perpetuity? Putting these concerns aside for the moment, I wish to focus on another aspect of the gun industry’s expansion of the Second Amendment — the entanglement of our own armed forces with the gun industry and the distribution of modern military weaponry. I have previously written about the Department of Defense (DOD contracting with the SIG-Sauer gun manufacturer to supply the military with the world’s most powerful and lethal semi-automatic firearm — the MCX-Spear. This advanced firearm features ammunition with such high velocity ammunition that it penetrates the body armor of its targets as well as similarly protected infrastructure. A little-known fact is that the Army not only provided the specifications for the weapon to the manufacturer but cooperated with it to permit its technology to be used in the commercial trafficking of the Spear to the general public. This begs the question of why the DOD failed to protect civilians from the misuse of this highly destructive war weapon by contractually or otherwise protecting its technology from disclosure and profiting through non-military commercial trafficking. It is frightening to contemplate the carnage that can be wreaked by just a single shooter armed with such a destructive weapon. Recently, a number of power stations in North Carolina, Washington state and Oregon were targeted by terrorists who, according to law enforcement sources, utilized “high-powered” firearms to inflict millions of dollars’ worth of damage to their energy infrastructures in those areas. This is exactly the scenario which will inevitably follow the practice of permitting and facilitating the dissemination of our highly advanced military weapons to the uncontrolled market of commercial vendors. These weapons will foreseeably wind up in the hands of domestic terrorists and mass murderers. And the reality of this partnership of our military with the gun dealers is even more troubling when you combine it with another little-known fact — in 2005, after Congress lifted a 10-year ban on the sale of assault weapons, the DOD officially lent its prestige to protecting the gun industry by recommending to Congress that it pass legislation (the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act conferring immunity on the arms industry for liability stemming from the resumption of the sales of these very types of weapons. Civilian casualties were an easily known and predictable consequence of these reckless actions by Congress in conjunction with the DOD, and the protection from liability was a key incentive to sales and maximum profiting by the industry. The result has already been felt by the tens of thousands of innocent victims murdered or incapacitated by those arming themselves with state of the art military firearms, and the losses have been exponentially increased by the grief of their loved ones as well as the terrible fear of what used to be safe — e.g., sending children to school, going to the theater, attending church, going to work, shopping at the mall and virtually every aspect of a normal life. I cannot overemphasize the impact of the omnipresence of these grave consequences on our society and culture. We simply are not safe anymore, and our very lives have been discounted and demeaned in favor of enhancing the profit margins of those engaging in the commercial trafficking of such weaponry. Our legal system protects lives and requires due process before the state may deprive anyone of life. Yet consider this contravention of that principle: The grant of immunity to the producers and sellers of these types of weapons deprives the victims and their families of any compensation much less due process in the taking of their lives. Children, parents and loved ones are left without any recourse, and there are no consequences for the profiteers. According to a recentNew York Timesarticle,gun violence is now the leading cause of death for American children. To add insult to injury, gun industry representatives recently testified before a congressional committee that they don’t even compile statistics on the incidents in which their military grade weapons are used in mass shootings or other criminal or terrorist attacks on civilians. Their attitude is, essentially, “Why should we?” The excuse that is advanced is that the murderers are committing criminal acts, and their crimes are not intended by the sellers but are intervening events for which the sellers bear no responsibility. This is a hollow defense which is contradicted by logic and common sense. Years ago, when I was serving on the bench, I had a case where a similar argument was advanced in an environmental case before me. An old-growth preserve, the Willamette National Forest’s Warner Creek, was severely burnt by arsonists, and the U.S. Forest Service decided to award a contract to a timber company to conduct salvage logging and replant the forest. Environmental groups filed a lawsuit contending that the Forest Service did not comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, which required the Forest Service to thoroughly consider the possibility of its decision on incentivizing future arsons in the forest. The agency had declined to study that issue because arson is a crime. I ruled that the criminal nature of arson did not insulate it from a hard look at the issue, including whether more arsons were a foreseeable consequence of awarding the salvage logging action, e.g., creating jobs in the community. The comparison is apt — by dismissing mass shootings and other such criminal acts perpetrated by the wielders of these firearms as irrelevant, the industry chooses to be blind to the reality and choice of their repetitive use in such crimes and continues to market them regardless Our elected representatives are another significant reason Americans continue to be victimized by the ongoing gun violence with no meaningful counter measures. TheCitizens Uniteddecision by the Supreme Court ruled that corporations have a right to contribute money to the campaign coffers of politicians. The consequent impact on legislators is a formidable obstacle to effective Congressional action. Our Supreme Court’s pretext that there is no “quid pro quo” in the contributions is swallowed in the muck of dark money and lack of accountability — and everyone knows it. This is part of why America hasn’t done what is necessary to eliminate our ongoing gun violence problem. There is a deadly combination of ignorance, falsehood, greed, concocted history, self-interest and a military-industrial connection that has brought us to the point where Americans are conditioned to accept the situation as normal. We must reject that construct, and push back with all our energy and wits. For example, on the legal front, we must challenge the legitimacy of the ahistorical version of the Second Amendment that is the foundation of the current jurisprudence within the judiciary. To my knowledge, that jurisprudence is not the product of any trial record developed through evidence subject to sworn testimony, cross-examination, or the opportunity to present contrary testimony through qualified history experts (a Garry Wills, for example, rather than a law professor or law clerk without such a background . Our judiciary should rarely tackle such controlling and disputed issues without affording a trial and findings by either a jury or a trial court. On the political front, America has begun to organize in a manner that counteracts the corporate money flowing into the campaign funds of lawmakers. Organizations such as Sandy Hook Promise, Moms Demand Action, Students Demand Action, Everytown for Gun Safety and March for Our Lives, among others, are urging legislators to pass gun safety laws and building a movement to reduce gun violence. On the military’s role, we must insist that they insert in their contracts with suppliers of military weapons the agreement not to share the technology with or distribute the weapons to the general public. This can be done without congressional legislation, as the current president, the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, can issue an order to that effect. Common sense alone tells us that our own military should not be funneling its weaponry to terrorists to use against our nation’s infrastructure and our people. There are other ideas, such as using the Environmental Protection Act as a legal tool to evaluate the health and safety risks of guns. The EPA’s Rules and Regulations that Impact Children’s Health require government actors, for example, to study the impact of proposed action on the health and safety of children and assess adverse and disproportionate risks in setting EPA standards. Mass shootings at schools typically involve implements that are developed by and for the military. These weapons are “products” which children are “exposed to.” We should push for the EPA to evaluate weapons in the public domain along with the air, water and chemical products that the EPA currently regulates. We should also require the military to study the impact on the safety of children of releasing their weapons to the public. As I discussed previously, the criminal act inherent in the misuse of such weapons is not a reason to ignore the problem, but instead, given its frequency, a compelling reason to address it. These are just some suggestions. I welcome others to chime in. The bottom line is that we are sacrificing the lives of our children and other victims; that is the true price, and no sane or democratic society should remain silent about this outrage. A nation that fails to protect its children is a failing state. It cannot survive."

They spend their time eating, snoozing, lollygagging in the grass and rolling in the snow. But the giant pandas that have roamed a few select U.S. zoos for the last half century have captivated visitors who flocked to exhibits and lined up to see the debut of panda cubs and marvel at what seemed like plush toys come to life.In a way that only exotic creatures can do, they enchanted Americans. So people were understandably bummed when the Chinese government ordered all remaining pandas in U.S. zoos back to China. The three at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in D.C. flew back (via FedEx earlier this month, with the four at Zoo Atlanta scheduled to depart next year. Did the Chinese decide to take them back as a, well, (you know , to the U.S. government at a time of deteriorating relations?We don’t know exactly why the Chinese ended the panda loan but we were heartened to hear Chinese President Xi Jinping say on Wednesday after meeting with President Joe Biden in Northern California that the Chinese “are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation.” He said he’d learned that the San Diego Zoo and people in California “very much look forward to welcoming pandas back.”Yes, we do. The only giant pandas to call California home were those loaned to the San Diego Zoo, which returned its last pandas to China in 2019. “We are excited to hear of President Xi’s commitment in continuing the giant panda conservation efforts between our two countries, and his attention to the wish of Californians and the San Diego Zoo to see the return of giant pandas,” said Paul A. Baribault, president and chief executive of the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. We get it that an agreement over pandas doesn’t resolve issues over spy balloons, Taiwan and fentanyl. But it’s still promising and unexpected good news that the Chinese would agree to share their pandas with us again.The program was always more than just a gift of cute rare animals. Although the first pandas did arrive in 1972 as a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to the American people after President Nixon’s historic visit to China. During the trip, First Lady Pat Nixon told the premier how much she liked pandas.Anyone who lived in D.C. in the ’70s and ’80s will remember the zoo’s relentless and closely chronicled efforts to get Ling Ling pregnant. (Pandas are notoriously difficult to breed. Although the zoo was successful several times, all the cubs she bore died shortly after birth.The National Zoo as well as Zoo Atlanta, the San Diego Zoo and the Memphis Zoo would go on, collectively, to host more than a couple dozen pandas — including the bevy of surviving cubs born here — over the last several decades. Over the years, zoos got better at breeding and raising healthy cubs.The panda program helped support their survival in the wild. U.S. zoos paid $1 million per year for the pandas — funds that went to China for conservation and research. Any cubs born in the U.S. zoos had to be returned at a young age. Zoo Atlanta has contributed more than $16 million for the conservation of giant pandas, the zoo says on its website. Those funds have supported research on genetic diversity and reserve management, among other projects.The conservation efforts have helped the panda population rebound in the bamboo forests of southern China. Giant pandas were once considered endangered after their numbers dwindled to about 1,100 in the 1980s due to loss of habitat. With an estimated 1,864 pandas in the wild at last count, their status was adjusted in 2016 to “vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Reviving the panda program won’t solve the conflicts between the U.S. and China. But it is one effort toward conservation that gives another generation of Americans a chance to get to know these remarkable animals.— Los Angeles TimesRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.A 22-year-old Hilo man accused of a series of violent assaults on his 23-year-old girlfriend has been released from custody by a judge without posting cash bail."
leoweekly_2023_64,"Whata wild couple of weeks in Louisville. The Department of Justice’s report delivered a scathing assessment of the Louisville Metro Police Department. Now we await the consent decree to be negotiated.Activists, like LEO’s occasional columnist Hannah Drake, have taken to social media to reiterate the fact that Black people in Louisville have been saying for many years that Louisville’s police are corrupt and abusive, as you’ll read in the DOJ news story in this issue from our news writer Josh Wood.The DOJ report only codified these truths into an investigation document. The issues with LMPD are long-standing and for sure, have many of their roots in the fact that Louisville has a long history of officers in the KKK.Nearly every Black person from Louisville can tell you a story about a less than savory interaction with a Louisville police officer.When I was a young woman, in the mid-nineties — my very early 20s — I was leaving the home of my best friend and driving along Frankfort Ave. toward my east end apartment. I had an expired tag that I’d already made arrangements to address. I knew this, so when a police officer pulled me over at 1:30 a.m., I expected it to be a simple interaction, maybe a citation that suggested that I get the plate renewal.Instead, a white male cop probably in his 40s, ran hand along the edge of my Buick. Because my car was old, I had to open the door slightly because the window no longer rolled down. The officer seemed out of sorts, not because my door opened but genuinely not right. He was very aggressive and jumpy.He asked where I was going this late at night and I told him, “home.” Then he asked, “Where did you come from?”He slid himself between the door and my open car.“A friend’s house.”That didn’t seem to satisfy him and he continued to press for information, while looking in my car with a flashlight. It felt intrusive. I was alone, very late at night and the way the cop was acting made me nervous.After the officer requested my license and other information, he walked away to his car. I called my friend. It was in the early years of cell phones so I was incredibly lucky to have one and be able to call my friend who also had a phone.I told him to stay on the line with me because a cop had pulled me over and was being weird and aggressive. So we made small talk just enough so that he could hear the conversation with the officer.As I watched the officer walk back to my car, I felt that he was about to escalate the situation. He gave my license and papers back with a citation but continued to press for information while again putting his physical body between my door and my open car. When he noticed the phone, he jumped back. Physically jumped back. When I saw this, I knew that he hadn’t expected the potential for there to be a witness to whatever he was planning.I immediately asked, in not such a nice way, if he needed anything else or if I was free to go. His voice stammered, he suddenly had little to say. When he finally settled on “no.”I reached around his body and grabbed the handle of my door, and began to shut it. He was still within the edge of the door and I almost hit him. He hopped back. I continued to talk with my friend on the phone for a while as I pulled away, watching the cop standing in the street, stunned.I don’t know if or what the cops intentions were that night, but my instinct and the aggressiveness of his demeanor and questioning made me think that being a small woman out at 1:30 a.m. with not a lot of traffic around had put me in a dangerous situation with this officer, and his intentions were not going to be kind and maybe not even legal.So I got away, but many many Black people did not and do not.The DOJ report just affirms what we already knew, and hopefully lets white Louisvillians know that these officers are not playing on an equal field and that Black citizens are bearing the brunt of local police aggression and adverse behaviors. Whether white Louisville believes it or not, the facts are documented and some remedy is due.Going forward, the best thing that the city could do, in light of this “new” knowledge, is open any and all negotiations with the FOP police union, and move swiftly on investigations into misconduct when they arise with an empowered Civilian Review and Accountability Board and Inspector General’s office.It’s not a big ask but it is the least Louisville could do. The actual very least.• ( ."
suffolknewsherald_2023_140,"Published 5:03 pm Tuesday, January 31, 2023ByJen JaquaThe years 1931-32 were a dismal time across the nation based on front pages published by newspapers. Each day brought a new report of war overseas. Although the United States was not directly involved yet, wars had everyone’s attention. Unemployment nationwide was reported to be about 33%, or 14 million unemployed — compare that to the 2022 unemployment of 3.5%, and it tells a tale of hard times. Other stories told of drought, flood, fire and famine. However the beginning of the ’30s had many notable achievements,The Star-Spangled Bannerwas adopted as the United States national anthem in March 1931. The same month, Nevada legalized gambling.In 1932, the Winter Olympics came to New York and it gave us Babe Ruth’s famous called shot. But the year also brought the first gas tax, 1 cent per gallon.The biggest local story on Jan. 9, 1931, was new phone books. An article titled “Local exchange is making delivery of telephone directories in Suffolk” details the plan for distributing the new book of numbers and collecting and destroying old books to avoid confusion. The directory, cited in the story as being the most referenced book on a daily basis, proceeded to give a detailed description of the book and functions it included, such as how to make out of town calls, what to do to report a telephone out of order, how to call information and other uses of the telephone. There was also a popular feature of the directory that many people found most useful, according to the article — that is, a page for frequently called numbers.A story in late January highlighted another depressing part of everyday life — tuberculosis was an ongoing battle. A front page story titled “Organize to battle TB in Suffolk” detailed a meeting of the Suffolk Tuberculosis Association, which was attended by many interested in creating a local organization to educate the public on TB. Plans were discussed for programs to educate and provide prevention at the schools as well as to treat those ill.With color television making advances, the big news in the spring 1931 was the “talkie” that was being produced by the News-Herald. The motion picture film featured members of local clubs and officials from the police and fire departments as well as citizens who had won the chance to audition via a contest. The plot of the talkie was created by local high school students.August 1932 headlines announced the burgeoning stock market recovery from the crash of 1929. A local bank owner, J.L. McLemore, announced via the Aug. 3 front page: “I believe we have definitely turned the corner to better times.”On Oct. 6, 1932, a small story gave the details of a new hardware store being built on East Washington Street, the first new business in more than a year. The story went on to mention more building and construction happening around the business district than had in the past four years. Business in Suffolk seemed to be on the upswing. An Oct. 21 article goes into more detail about ongoing construction in Suffolk. Projects included a service station at the corner of West Washington and North streets, converting a house on North Main into apartments, as well as building a brick store on East Washington. These projects employed more than 100 people in the city.On Dec. 1, 1932, the News-Herald announced its oldest reader had just renewed his subscription. J.W. Pruden started reading the paper in 1893. He is quoted as saying, “The Herald was one of the best weekly papers in Virginia and when it was absorbed by the News to make the present daily paper, I enjoyed it even more.

eugeneweekly_2023_2,"We ve got issues. Eugene has a remarkable legacy of arts support, shaping the distinct and dynamic arts community we cherish today. Esteemed institutions like the Very Little Theatre and Eugene-Springfield Youth Orchestras, and iconic destinations like the Eugene Saturday Market and the Hult Center hold decades of cherished memories for our community members. Every day, our nonprofit arts and culture organizations are actively transforming their communities into better places to live and work, nurturing creativity, celebrating diversity and spreading joy. In a time when many government and private sector leaders may feel challenged to fund the arts, a new national study brings a welcome message: When you invest in the arts and culture, you are investing in an industry that strengthens your economy and builds more livable communities. Enlarge Arts & Economic Prosperity 6 (AEP6 , a comprehensive study of the nation’s nonprofit arts and culture industry conducted every five years, has recently unveiled truly impressive results. In 2022, Eugene’s arts and culture sector generated a remarkable $123.8 million in economic activity. This figure comprises spending by nonprofit organizations and the economic ripples created by people attending arts events. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Nonprofit arts and culture organizations are more than creative entities; they operate as thriving businesses. They create jobs, engage local professionals like accountants and plumbers and actively support neighboring businesses by procuring goods and services. This financial infusion — $90.2 million dollars here in Eugene — ensures the sustainability of these vital institutions while acting as a driving force for broader economic growth within our community. Furthermore, art events also catalyze economic activity through spending by attendees. When people attend a cultural event, they often make an outing of it — dining at a restaurant, paying for parking or public transportation, enjoying dessert after the show, and returning home to pay for child or pet care. Audience spending generated $33.6 million, underscoring the mutually beneficial relationship between the arts and local commerce. In all, this economic activity supports 2,714 local jobs. Investment in the nonprofit arts and culture industry fosters communities where people want to live and work. It is where entrepreneurs and creative businesses are launched and where nighttime economies flourish. When we prioritize diverse cultural expressions and traditions, it nurtures social connections, promotes community pride and identity, and boosts tourism by providing authentic experiences that draw visitors to the community. If visitors have a positive experience, it may become a place to work — and ultimately one in which to live. Creating livable communities is economic development. In Eugene, local arts and culture events drew nearly 150,000 visitors from outside Lane County. On average, excluding ticket prices, their spending on events exceeded that of local attendees by 187 percent ($68.73 to $23.92 . Moreover, these events help keep discretionary spending close to home, with nearly 42 percent of local attendees admitting they would have traveled outside the area for a similar event. AEP6 extends beyond economic and financial data to include social impact measurements that gauge arts and culture’s influence on community well-being. In Eugene, a striking 91 percent of attendees agreed that the activities or venues where they were surveyed inspired a profound sense of pride in their neighborhood or community. The arts endured a severe blow from the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to recover slowly. Nevertheless, they played a crucial role in helping us heal socially and bounce back economically. The arts introduced joy during trying times, mitigated isolation and loneliness and boosted overall life satisfaction. They also reignited our local economy, encouraging people to venture out, engage and invest in the community. AEP6 makes clear that when we fund the arts, we are not supporting a frill or an extra. Rather, we are investing in an industry — one that stimulates the economy, supports local jobs and contributes to building healthy and vibrant communities. Let’s continue building upon this legacy of arts support in Eugene, nurturing a creative environment that uplifts us all."
suffolknewsherald_2023_91,"Published 4:31 pm Tuesday, March 21, 2023ByJen JaquaIn the height of the war, 1944-1945, news of battles, losses and gains dominated the front page of Suffolk News-Herald as they did in most newspapers across the country.Rations and shortages of just about every material were part of daily life. Some of those who hoped to escape from their hardship via a bottle would be disappointed — shortly after the new year, it was announced there would be no whiskey distilled in the United States in ’44. For a country not long out of Prohibition, the stores of whiskey were not many.As spring broke in ’44, whispers and vague news stories were published telling of a hopeful future.A story on April 6, 1944, announced D-Day was set. The where, when and all other details were held secret, reportedly known by very few. But the plan was announced as what can be assumed was a promise of hope.Other hints of an end to the war, or at least the hardship caused in the U.S. as a result of the war, came in the form of ration changes. In mid-May 1944, ration limits began to be increased, and items such as typewriters were removed from the rationed goods. Others, such as dairy food and fresh foods, were increased.Suffolk’s own claim to fame, however, was still a bit difficult to get. Half of the Virginia peanut supply was earmarked for only the Army. Peanuts were included in the meal rations for soldiers. Three reasons were given for peanuts being so important to GIs: they are liked by everyone, they are rich in B-complex vitamins and they require little space per the nutritional value. There was a story shared of a food ration warehouse on the war front that was left unattended, and a group of soldiers helped themselves to the rations. However, what was discovered was the only thing taken from the rations were the peanuts.On June 6, 1944, D-Day had arrived. The headlines broadcast the news: “Allies establish beachhead,” “11,000 planes thrown into invasion” and “4,000 ships transport troops, Churchill says.”TheSuffolk News-Herald editor was among the first to get news of the invasion.“The News-Herald editor, Lyman G. Barrett, was the first in Suffolk and Nansemond County to receive the news of the liberation landings In France this morning. The Associated Press In Richmond called him at about 3:45 a.m., and within a few minutes he had reached the newspaper office, had turned on the teletype machines and was watching the developments. The official communication from General Dwight D. Eisenhower had reached America at 3:32 a.m. So the News-Herald knew of the momentous event within 13 minutes of the original news flash.” That was lightning speed for 1944.Not all citizens were in favor of the United States’ involvement in the war. The FBI arrested a 35-year-old naturalized American citizen of German descent on charges of espionage. Arrested in Tennessee, the man had lived in Suffolk during the time of the suspected crimes. The man admitted to being trained in espionage and having sent multiple messages and pieces of information between 1940-1941.As the heat of summer broke, the first news stories of concentration camps confirmed what was long known. At first, they received only a brief mention in a story of the advances of the Russian army: “Scene of Horror: Lublin was the scene of some of the most shocking incidents of the German anti-semetic terror programs and formerly had a population of 115,000, 30% Jewish.”1945 brought headline after headline of battles won and cities liberated. On Jan. 17: “Warsaw has been liberated”’ on Feb. 22: “Room to room fight waged in Manila hotel.”On April 12, 1945, a special edition was published declaring “Roosevelt dead: Truman sworn in as president.”Less than a month later, Adolf Hitler is reported to be dead. Within days, German armies in Italy surrendered. News turned to the Pacific as war there waged on.An Aug. 7 headline declared the historic atom bomb dropping: “Hiroshima is believed wiped out, most terrible force ever loosed on world,” and two days later on Aug. 9, “Atomic bomb falls on Nagasaki.”1945 ended as most rations ended and men were discharged from the Army to return home.Jen Jaquais the creative director for the Suffolk News-Herald.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_181,"It took no time at all for Donald Trump to again begin attacking the law clerk of Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron after an appellate court stayed Engoron’s gag order against the former president in the ongoing case over fraud in Trump’s real estate business. The defendant assailed Engoron in personal terms, calling him “politically biased” and “a disgrace.”Trump and his sycophants will hand-wave all this away as politicking or campaign rhetoric, but that’s not really what it is. Few people think political campaigns are about being polite. These are ultimately contests between people, which require one candidate to lay out in stark terms why they deserve to win, and the other person doesn’t. It’s expected that barbs will be thrown, people called liars and opportunists and crooks.This isn’t that. For one thing, Engoron might have been elected, but he’s not now on the ballot, certainly not against Trump, and that goes double for his civil servant clerk, a private person who is — and it is shocking that this needs to be said — allowed to have personal political opinions.Even if they were, what Trump is lobbing aren’t points of political disagreement or even criticisms around specific actions the judge has or hasn’t taken in this case.His contention, distilled down to its most basic elements, is that the judge and his staff are agents of some sinister partisan conspiracy to bring him down and are practically committing treason by daring to try him in accordance with the law. The leap from that to what he wants done about isn’t a big one.At minimum, Trump believes that he should be above the law. At worst, he’s nudging his followers to take matters into their own hands, and regardless of his plausible deniability, that’s exactly how some of them will take it.That this is the case isn’t something we have to speculate about. David DePape — who was just convicted of two federal charges stemming from his attack against former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband Paul with a hammer at the couple’s San Francisco home last year — has been very open about the fact that his radicalization began with the former president’s own conspiracy theorizing about a mass conspiracy against him.Even as DePape stood trial, Trump openly mocked his victim, telling raucuous rally crowd this September that he would “stand up to crazy Nancy Pelosi, who ruined San Francisco — how’s her husband doing, anybody know?” and laughing about the lifelong injuries caused by a man acting on the belief that his actions were sanctioned by Trump.None of what the former president has done or said since has suggested that they really weren’t sanctioned by him.As the gag order was lifted, Trump reposted a post on Truth Social in which a follower fantasized about conducting a “citizens arrest” against Engoron and New York Attorney General Tish James.Trump, like anyone else in this country, has a First Amendment right to free speech.He does not have a First Amendment right to be listened to, given any power or audience by those in power. By continuing to treat him as the standard-bearer of their party, they are signing off on political violence.—New York Daily News Editorial Board"
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_15,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°It has been more than a month since the attack on Israel that killed more than 1,400 people, according to Israeli officials. In responding to that atrocity, Israel has relentlessly bombarded Gaza and launched a ground operation with the objectives of destroying Hamas and rescuing hostages. The result has been a humanitarian catastrophe with more than 10,000 people in Gaza killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, and massive displacement and destruction.It is time that Israel heeded calls from the United States and other nations for a humanitarian pause in its attacks to allow for expanded efforts to relieve some of the misery. There are signs that some respite may be in the works, but pauses in violence need to be long and frequent enough to deliver meaningful assistance to civilians in Gaza.On Thursday, President Joe Biden confirmed that he had asked for a pause in Israeli attacks, one that would last “a lot more than three days.” Biden’s comment came a day after diplomats at a Group of 7 meeting in Tokyo issued a statement — crafted in part by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken — calling for “humanitarian pauses and corridors to facilitate urgently needed assistance, civilian movement and the release of hostages.” The statement called on all parties to the conflict to allow “unimpeded humanitarian support for civilians, including food, water, medical care, fuel and shelter, and access for humanitarian workers.”Congress also is getting involved. On Wednesday, 24 Democratic U.S. senators, including California’s Laphonza Butler, and two independents, Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucus with the Democrats, sent a letter to Biden. Even as the senators expressed support for new aid to Israel to help it replenish its defenses, they asked for “information relative to these two clear U.S. priorities: supporting an Israeli strategy that will effectively degrade and defeat the threat from Hamas and taking all possible measures to protect civilians in Gaza.”The letter also asked Biden to “inform us about what specific mechanisms you are putting in place to ensure that Israeli military operations conducted inside Gaza are carried out in accordance with international humanitarian law and to ensure that any U.S.-provided equipment is used in a manner consistent with U.S. law.”These are legitimate questions, and Biden should respond to them. But the immediate priority is to address the dire civilian toll of this conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel might be open to “ little pauses” in its campaign against Hamas. On Thursday, the White House indicated that Israel would engage in daily four-hour pauses of military operations in parts of northern Gaza.There are also reports that a three-day “humanitarian pause” might be part of an agreement for the release of some hostages held by Hamas. Progress on hostage release would be welcome, but it shouldn’t be a precondition for a meaningful humanitarian pause. Civilians in Gaza are suffering, and they need a lifeline.—Los Angeles TimesHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

From our sister paper in Tampa, Creative Loafing, we re happy to introduce Oracle of Ybor, written by Caroline DeBruhl. Here you may submit your questions about life and the tarot helps to guide your answers.Dear Oracle,A few months ago, I went to another state to visit a friend, “M,” and met her friend, “R.” We really hit it off and started talking daily. I’ve gone back to visit J, and it was not exactly smooth. I didn’t know what to make of it when I left, but we still talk all the time, and he tells me he cares about me a lot. “M” has asked him flat out if he wants to date, and he says yes, but he doesn’t want to “fuck it up.” I don’t know what to do. Do we keep working at this, or is it doomed because it’s long distance?--Single and tryingCards: Seven of Cups, Three of Swords, Ace of Cups, Two of Sword (rev. Dear Single,To get this out of the way: while long distance can be a bummer, plenty of relationships survive it. It’s s not a death blow and, in some ways, can deepen a relationship because you spend so much time just talking.However, the issues you’re describing don’t actually have to do with the distance. I don’t know R, but I have a witchy feeling that he would still have a fear of “fucking it up” and keep this relationship in the “are we/aren’t we” limbo, even if he lived a mile away.I want to start with the last card of the spread, the Two of Swords reversed. Twos are about balance, and for the Two of Swords, it’s about using a critical eye to see what’s needed for true balance. You’re at a crossroads right now, and this relationship—as you describe—does not seem balanced. You seem ready to commit to a relationship, while R does not. That has been the situation for the past few months and the situation today.The Seven of Cups is another type of crossroads. There are plenty of options presented to you but be wary: some of these options are deceitful. It’s important to apply that critical eye to the situation in front of you. What does it actually look like to “keep working at it”? What is R prepared to give you at this moment—not in six months, not in two years, but right now? What can you expect if you visit him again? What would it look it if you don’t “work on it”?Most importantly: do you think R is your only option in dating? Do you feel like it’s “work on things with R” or “stay single”? If so, why do you think that? And is that thought deceitful?With the heartsick Three of Swords and the Ace of Cups, I think you very much want to be in love. I think you want to be a healthy, loving relationship—something many of us want—but this thing with R is not making you happy. He’s not giving you any relationship right now, let alone a healthy one.Will cutting it off hurt? Probably. Will it hurt more than staying? I don’t know. I think you have to turn that critical eye to your own heart. Is this current pain worth the potential future with R? Will it hurt more to stop speaking with R and try with someone else? Is the pain of being single greater or less than what R can give you now?Be honest with yourself about how you’re feeling and what you want. And be frank with R. Tell him what you’d like, and he can tell you if he wants the same thing. Maybe he will.Maybe he won’t. But use that critical eye to protect your heart.I’m sorry for this difficult situation. Whatever you decided, I hope you find peace.Dear Oracle,I’m about to move in with my girlfriend. It’s the first time either of us has lived with a romantic partner. Any advice?- Next Step NewbieCards: Six of Wands, Six of Cups, JusticeDear NSN,First, have a space in your new apartment that’s just yours. Maybe it’s a desk or a bookshelf but a place where you can put your things and arrange them as you like. It creates a little anchor of “you” in the home. Next, make an agreement about household labor. Does one person cook and the other do dishes? Who washes the towels? Cleans the bathroom? Ground rules like help—and with the Justice card, having those boundaries and balance in place will help things go smoothly.Justice also can be about financial balance. Are you both going to split the bills 50/50? In proportion to your salaries? By expense? (Someone covers rent while someone else covers the food and light bill. Again, it’s great if all expectations are laid out in full.Other conversations should include guest policy (regular, overnight, and multi-day , cleanliness expectations, closet division, décor choices, air conditioning temperatures (day and night , and whether you think it’s appropriate to use the overhead light at all times or if lamps should be relied upon. (I, myself, am staunchly pro-lamp. But for the most part, you should enjoy this new step! The Six of Wands is a celebratory card that pops up when there’s joy and excitement in the air. It’s a public display and the public is happy for you. It’s a big deal to move in with your partner! It announces a level of seriousness and I have a feeling people are happy that you two are taking this step.The child-like love of the Six of Cups suggests that you two are going to grow up together (or grow old together, depending on how old you are now while also creating a home that feels safe and comfortable. It can be incredibly fun and fulfilling to make a home with a person, and I hope as you two feel that joy and comfort.

suffolknewsherald_2023_156,"Published 7:58 pm Friday, January 13, 2023ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceWe were picking up a few items at Walmart when a stack of small, golden-colored buckets caught Timothy’s eyes. “Look! A golden bucket,” he said. “That’s neat,” I replied as I remained on the mission of getting what we needed. Timothy’s eyes strained to maintain contact with the golden bucket. I placed an item in the cart as Timothy asked if we could look at the object that caught his eye.We stopped to examine the small, golden bucket for a moment before heading toward the next item on our list.“Can we get it,” he asked.“What are you going to do with a bucket,” I asked.“I don’t know,” he said, “I’ll keep stuff in it. Who else do you know who has a golden bucket?”“Let’s just get what we came in to get,” I said as we walked toward the next item on our list.Timothy was quiet as we placed our final item in the cart and began walking toward the checkout. His voice sounded hesitant to speak, but he asked, “Before we go, do you think we could get the bucket? Please? It’s only one dollar.”I’m not sure if it was the polite tone of voice or the fact that he hadn’t forgotten about that small, golden bucket, but I relented on my initial answer of no. We walked to the aisle, and Timothy grabbed the one-dollar bucket.I questioned my decision immediately. Did I let him talk me into grabbing an unneeded item? Should I have stood firm in not spending money on something he may not even use that much? Did I make the right decision?Those who have gone shopping with children of any age know that there is always something that they will want inside the store. You would have an entire Walmart inside your home if you said yes to their every request. You can’t buy them everything they want, and you shouldn’t buy them something each time they ask.However, there are times when it is okay to give them their request. This was a small item, it was one dollar, and he didn’t forget about it as soon as we walked by the aisle. He had been well-behaved, hadn’t asked for anything else recently, and didn’t get upset when I said no to his initial request.Sometimes we get so much into the habit of saying no that we don’t even pause to see what they are asking. We don’t consider the item’s size, price, or if it is something they will use. We say no without even looking at what they want.We should not buy children every item for which they ask. It spoils them, teaches them bad habits, creates clutter in the house, and breaks the bank. However, sometimes – every once in a while – it’s okay to say yes.Has the bucket been used much? No, but it does still sit on his dresser. Am I glad that I changed my initial answer and purchased the bucket? Yes.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

It’s a national holiday, traditionally celebrated in the United States, on the fourth Thursday of November each year. It commemorates the get-together by the Plymouth colonists from England and the Native American Wampanoag people in 1621, sharing the autumn harvest feast.(To native Americans who may have suffered “injustices” (oppression, racism, genocide , Thanksgiving Day is a day to commemorate their “National Day of Mourning since 1970. It’s a special day for people in America to celebrate their life, their blessings, sharing food (like turkey and other prepared dishes , friendship, faith, and fellowship with their family members, neighbors, guests, and friends while enjoying their freedom and togetherness, with entertainment like watching football games on TV.I remember my first Thanksgiving Day in America happened at my sister’s house in California four decades ago. I couldn’t believe I saw (and tasted or eaten the biggest turkey in my life for the first time! I didn’t know then why America celebrates Thanksgiving Day in November. I just thought it was a day to give thanks for all our blessings and enjoy—life, liberty, freedom, faith and democracy.On this Thanksgiving Day, I offer my prayer of gratitude to our Almighty God for the opportunity of being here in America, having served honorably for 20 years in the United States Navy and retired (but with service-connected disabilities . I give thanks to America, my adoptive country, for the freedom and liberty my family and I and friends enjoy.I’m grateful to our Almighty God for my family and friends near and far, for having good neighbors, dedicated and dependable military armed forces, local officials and public servants (like law enforcement officials, police officers, teachers, school and hospital employees who do their job every day.

suffolknewsherald_2023_87,"Published 6:02 pm Friday, March 24, 2023ByLetters to the EditorEditor:Every day, I wake up feeling lucky to live in Suffolk. From getting my nails done in the University Boulevard shopping center, or grabbing dinner at Sushi Ninja with some friends on a Saturday. Safe to say, it is a true privilege to be a resident of this great town. And I think that this statement can be applied to a lot of our lives, not just my own.This has made me think more about those who are not as fortunate. Did you know that 736 million people live in extreme poverty all over the world? And that an estimated 2.5 billion people lack access to improved sanitation? The good news is, we here in Hampton Roads can do something about it.There is a false implication that about 25% of the United States budget goes to foreign aid, and would want to reduce it to a level of 10%. In reality, it is less than 1%.Organizations such as the Borgen Project have done substantial work to help increase the amount of money spent on foreign aid through advocacy work, lobbying, and grassroots organizing. Reduction in poverty rates is proven to reduce conflict and thus increase our own national security. When people are well fed, they can also work more, and this helps grow our own economy by creating trade opportunities. All in all, there are a lot more pros than cons when talking about getting rid of global hunger. We just have to make the commitment together, to encourage our elected officials to vote yes on the International Affairs Budget by calling and emailing them.Together, we can show how strong of a community Suffolk truly is, and how we can show up for those in need.Sonali AnandSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

eugeneweekly_2023_23,"We ve got issues. The facts about the war on Palestine should be familiar — more than 14,800 dead, the vast majority of whom are women, children and elderly. The U.N.’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, says outbreaks of disease and hunger in Gaza now appear “inevitable.” The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA’s chief said Thursday, Nov. 16, “I do believe there is a deliberate attempt to strangle our operation.” Doctors Without Borders says that “Health care workers are regularly being attacked by the Israeli military while ambulances cannot move freely to reach the injured and ill.” The Israeli government is doing its best to stop the media from reporting on its horrors. A Reuters journalist, Issam Abdallah, was targeted and killed near the Lebanon border, according to Reporters without Borders. Beirut-based TV channel Al Mayadeen says that Israel targeted and killed two of its journalists recently. The Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 53 journalists and media workers have been killed since Oct. 7. More than 100 Israelis were arrested just in the first week of the bombardment for social media posts deemed sympathetic to Palestinians. In the U.S., professionals had to step down, resign, renege or be canceled for expressing even the slightest sympathy for Palestinians. Universities have canceled film showings, public talks and student groups that are critical of Israel. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. The disinformation is nonstop from Israel. Israel’s army accuses Palestinian olive pickers of being Hamas; its diplomats accuse journalists and U.N.’s refugee agency of being Hamas. Israel’s claims that a misfired rocket from Islamic Jihad bombed a hospital has been proven false, and Israel’s claim that a major Hamas command center existed under al-Shifa hospital is also false. Israel controls all entry and exits of the 25 mile by five mile Gaza Strip, and it has not been letting in significant amounts of food, water or fuel, with the stated intent to cause mass suffering. Roughly 70 percent of Gaza’s population of 2.2 million is displaced. The real casualty numbers are likely much much higher than the Gaza health ministry reports. How are we to frame our understanding of this? People who know about war crimes — crimes against humanity, proportionality, collective punishment — are in agreement that Israel is obviously guilty. “Genocide is staring us in the face,” the prominent Israeli-American scholar of the Holocaust, Omer Bartov, said Nov. 3, weeks before various supplies of potable water, food and fuel for hospitals have run out. Others, like Israel’s Minister for Agriculture and former head of the Shin Bet, Avi Dichter, compare this bombing to thenakbaor “catastrophe” of 1947-1949 when 720,000 Palestinian civilians became refugees. On Nov. 11 the Israeli minister matter-of-factly stated: “We are now rolling out the Gaza Nakba.” Others use “ethnic cleansing.” “Palestinians are in grave danger of mass ethnic cleansing,” said a U.N. human rights expert on Oct. 14 before five weeks of continuous bombing and a ground invasion. For those disposed to reference the history of the U.S. to understand the conflict in Palestine, they use “settler colonialism” — a framework that describes the process of Indigenous dispossession by settlers and governments. Some strident critics of Israel make the case that the country has become a fascist state that is now controlled by the heirs of Ze’ev Jabotinsky (grandfather of the ruling Likud party and Meir Kahane (an inspiration for a coalition partner, the Jewish Home party . Jabotinsky and Kahane were often called fascist by notable Israeli and Jewish contemporaries. There was a four-day cease-fire for a hostage exchange that began on Nov. 24 and has been extended for two days as of press time. The cease-fire needs to be permanent. Over 75 percent — and growing — of Democrats support a cease-fire. Over 66 percent of Americans support a cease-fire. The vast majority of the world’s population wants a cease-fire. Millions of protesters have filled the world’s cities calling for a cease-fire. Rep. Val Hoyle and the Eugene City Council must support a lasting cease-fire and an end to U.S. military aid to Israel. On Monday, Nov.27, Eugene residents called on the City Council to pass such a resolution. Hoyle must sign on to the Ceasefire Now Resolution H.R. 786 and support Sen. Bernie Sanders’ call for U.S. aid (currently $3.8 billion per year, and President Joe Biden is pledging $14 billion more to Israel to be conditioned on Israel following international law."
suffolknewsherald_2023_228,"Published 4:31 pm Tuesday, August 1, 2023ByJen JaquaIn 1977, Suffolkians proved that no price was too high for coffee. A random sample of restaurants, lunch counters and grocery stores in Suffolk indicated that price increases averaging 20-30% failed to dent the local passion for coffee. Rather surprisingly, one store manager gleefully reported that coffee sales had gone up beyond normal. The coffee drinking situation is not all that surprising to Ed Dunphy, manager of a downtown lunch counter. “If you really want a cup of coffee, you’ll pay 30 cents per cup, if you don’t you won’t pay it.” Dunphy said he raised the price of a cup from 20 cents to 30 cents at his counter.Hot coffee may have been needed to stay warm. In February 1977, Virginia suffered from a severe energy crisis.Gov. Mills E. Godwin ordered that all retail and service businesses limit their working hours to 40 hours weekly and that office thermostats be turned down to 65 degrees.Businesses were not the only places affected by the energy crisis. Suffolk Public Schools adhered to the 65-degree minimum temperature, and thermostats were cut back to 60 degrees after 3 p.m. School activities in the night hours were canceled.The energy conservation order resulted in job losses.The original conservation order, which went into effect during January 1977, limited industrial and commercial customers to 15% of their daily gas usage. The order prevented Planters Peanuts, Thomas J. Upton Inc., and A&P Nut Processing Co. from using natural gas for processing. During the conservation order, A&P Nut Processing Co. laid off as many as 100 employees. Planters Peanuts also laid off some workers but recalled them when the company switched to propane gas.In March, consumers faced another shortage amid a fear of a popular artificial sweetener being banned. Food and Drug Administration officials said they would ban sale of saccharin after gigantic quantities of the sweetener was fed to laboratory rats and shown to cause cancer in the animals. The agency said it was required by law to ban any substance which was shown to cause cancer in animals, regardless of the quantity of the substance ingested by the animals.In response, U.S. Sen. William L. Scott introduced legislation to reverse the federal government’s proposed ban on saccharin. “As all of us know, virtually any safe substance produced for human consumption can be lethal or very harmful if ingested in excessive quantities,” the Virginia senator said. “As many of my colleagues have indicated, removal of saccharin from the marketplace would impose hardships on many millions of people who depend on it as a sugar substitute.”Scott said he favored the suggestion that citizens “be informed of the benefits and risks of using saccharin and allowed to make their own personal decisions.”From artificial sweeteners to corporal punishment, the Supreme Court rulings made the headlines.In April, the Suffolk Public Schools superintendent clarified that the Supreme Court’s decision that corporal punishment in public schools is constitutional did not give Suffolk city teachers the right to paddle a child without following the School Board’s policy. Under that policy, corporal punishment had to be administered either by a principal or by a teacher in the presence of a principal, and the child had to be allowed to tell his or her side of the story. Director of Pupil Personnel Mack Benn Jr. said he supported the court decision and agreed that prior notice to a child’s parents should not be required. “Superintendent Robert A. Wood said the board’s bylaw is ‘very strict’ and that a child — usually a first-, second-, or third-grader — is paddled ‘only as a last resort when all other reasoning has been exhausted.’ It is used ‘very rarely’ in Suffolk, he said, and he added that no injuries have resulted,” the News-Herald reported.While coffee prices went up and sweeteners were debated, one business came to town that provided an assortment of food.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_139,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Kate Cox, a 31-year-old Dallas-Fort Worth married mother of two, might die. She’s not recovering from some tragic accident, nor does she have some kind of untreatable ailment. The best path to her health is eminently clear and medically proven: an abortion to terminate an unviable 20-week pregnancy, as recommended by her doctors.Those doctors notably don’t include Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has gotten the state Supreme Court to halt a lower court’s temporary restraining order that had given her the right to obtain such an abortion under one of the state’s narrow exceptions to a near-total ban. To ensure that Cox wouldn’t move ahead with a procedure, Paxton also sent letters to several hospitals threatening legal action if they provided Cox the medical care that she so desperately needs.A medical decision of Cox and her doctors, supported by her husband, should be up to Cox and her doctors, supported by her husband, not Paxton and some judges. The same goes for all women and girls. Abortion care, freely sought and properly medically regulated, should always be available to anyone who needs it, regardless of how compelling politicians might consider their personal circumstances. Nonetheless, Cox’s plight really puts the lie to the claim that any part of this is about protecting life.In his petition to the high court, Paxton wrote that “nothing can restore the unborn child’s life that will be lost as a result” of their failure to stop the lower court order. He did not specify in the filing what this life would entail; the consensus of Cox’s actual doctors is that the child would live for perhaps a few days of suffering before succumbing to complications of a rare genetic condition.In other words, Paxton — who knows plenty about opportunistic legal maneuvering from experience delaying his own long-awaited securities fraud trial by more than eight years — is exploiting his office to condemn the child of a nonviable pregnancy to a short and miserable process of dying. That’s not an exaggeration, it’s the almost certain reality as can be dispassionately described by trained medical professionals which, again, Paxton and his lawyers are not.Paxton’s concerns about life also clearly don’t extend to Cox herself, whose own life is threatened by the pregnancy, not just hypothetically but as evidenced by the fact that she’s already had to go to the emergency room multiple times. Cox needs an abortion in order to protect her own life and her fertility for having a child in the future.Does Paxton care about Cox’s two children whose lives would certainly be indelibly impacted by the preventable death of their mother? Does he care about anything but his own political agenda?In effect, Cox has done everything a politician like Paxton might demand. She’s married, has and wants kids and is not considering the termination of a viable pregnancy. That he nonetheless wants her to potentially die — and is intending to prosecute anyone who might help her not die — should be a crystal clear signal that Paxton and his extremist ilk can never be satisfied. Their anti-choice campaign must be defeated decisively, in the courts, at the ballot box and in our moral calculus as a society.—New York Daily News Editorial Board/TNSIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big."
leoweekly_2023_25,"Mynephew, Zachary, was born in 1993. He came into this world nine months after my father died suddenly from a massive heart attack. I was 23 and struggling to survive on my own in Louisville as a full-time student with full-time employment.My sister, Angie —Zachary’s mom — was also struggling to find her way and when she became pregnant, had to tell our grieving mother that she was with child, out of wedlock, on the week our father passed.It was a very dark and heavy time for all of us as I quit school mid-semester and moved home.My sister moved home as well.I often see the three of us — Mother, Maiden, Crone — frozen in time, stunned by the abrupt halt to all our plans and certainties in life. Our foundation had been destroyed and we were left to find a reason in a unified loss.Angie’s pregnancy was the only symbol of hope and we all desperately placed our focus on this new life in the midst of our grief. Zachary was not planned but was meant to be in ways that I feel deep in my gut to this very day.I became my sister’s birth partner and went through the entire pregnancy by her side. We clung to this tiny light in the darkness of our reality. I stood by my sister as a witness to the birth of my one and only nephew. Zachary was born, wrinkled and screaming. The medical staff cleaned him, swaddled, and handed the tiny package to me. It was a joyous moment and I never wanted to let him go.Zachary was given his biological father’s name, even though this man had no part in his life outside of a few awkward phone calls on his birthdays and the one visit during his teen years which was the pinnacle exchange between them. Zachary was raised by his mother and grandmother, known as “Nan” to every child that was fortunate enough to be in her presence. He grew up in our childhood home in Radcliff with other young cousins, and ran in small groups of trusted friends who called themselves “four quarters of a dollar.”I moved back to Louisville to begin piecing my life back together but I never stopped making time for memories with Zachary. I was working, going to school full time to pay rent and build my career. I don’t remember having much down time but I would welcome weekend visits with Zachary at least once a month. He, also, looked forward to these visits, showing up with his Scooby-doo Magic Bus suitcase that held all the treasures he wished to share with his Auntie. Sometimes these visits were the only things keeping me going.Zachary was the only man in the family, raised in the shadow of a grandfather he would never know. On some level it seemed he understood the losses of the three women who were left to raise him.When he lost one of the four quarters at the age of eighteen, he had his first taste of this same kind of loss. I watched my nephew harden and retreat inward just as his life was truly beginning.It was not easy for Zachary to find himself after this incident. His self-actualization began when he decided to have his name officially changed. He shared that he did not know any way outside of “our” way. It was a change full of hope and claiming of the self that made all of us proud.The next ten years of his life would be full of work, settling into a life on his own in Louisville, and finding his tribe.I felt distant from him during this time and the turmoil of this world kept him struggling with his purpose. As the world turned upside down with Covid, he came up for air and allowed me into his heart and head for a moment. He’d met a girl that was a great friend to him and slowly brought her into our conversations and check-ins.Emily was quiet — steady with delicate features and a soft heart. She too was raised in similar personal loss and tragedy that causes one to grow up fast. She was in a difficult situation as a caregiver to her niece and she struggled to move forward as a girlfriend with Zachary. My nephew had to make a tough choice — falling in love with a woman who had a child that was not theirs — so he took his time.Zach called me about a month ago and happily shared that he was going to embrace our way of an unconventional life. He would be heading to the courthouse to marry in three weeks, and then have a small ceremony of those close to him to witness the love he had found.He married at the courthouse and then committed in front of their friends and family in the backyard of our new home the day after my own wedding anniversary.It was a privilege, a celebration, and a huge exhale for my sister and I as we watched this boy change into a man.Zachary and Emily committed to marriage and instant family with pure joy and honest union.The ceremony was simple and private. The two souls joining that day stood on common ground and accepted a child into their union with a courage only true love can bring. I got to witness a full-circle moment with my sister as she stood by their side during the ceremony.“Our” way makes the best of the situation and continues to hold our heads high, sometimes with tears in our eyes, whether in grief or joy. We face life without turning away from hard truths and we have learned that we will always be given another chance to love. Our family name and spirit was rescued in this union.• ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_42,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Israel, under attack from murderous Hamas terrorists, needs American financial and military support, even as the beleaguered civilian population of Gaza deserves humanitarian help: Republicans in Congress entirely agree with President Biden and Democrats there. They are all together on the urgency to send assistance to Israel battling against Hamas.Where Republicans break with Biden — or at least a significant slice of them under the thrall of former President Donald Trump do — is in also aiding Ukraine, which has been under brutal attack from Russia for a year and eight months. Against all expectations, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rallied Ukrainians to fend off Moscow’s invasion.The consequences are quite clear: Should America give up on Ukraine, Ukraine will fall to Vladimir Putin’s forces, and the message will be clear that the strong can gobble the weak even when the world says no. The message will be sent that despite endless strident statements about how morally unacceptable it is for one country to invade a sovereign neighbor, if you wait long enough — less than two years — the world will lose its will and accept the supposedly unacceptable.It comes as little surprise that Trump, who coddled Putin during his four years in office, has a soft spot for the Russian strongman. And just as Trump is in Putin’s thrall, congressional Republicans are in Trump’s.Bending to them, new Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is intent on separating the two requests for foreign aid, Israel and Ukraine. Moreover, Johnson proposes paying for the aid to Israel by slashing tens of billions of dollars in funding for more robust IRS enforcement, an asinine, ideologically motivated push that will forfeit much more revenue than it “saves.”The reason Johnson wants to put Ukraine assistance in a separate bill is that he knows there’s dwindling support in his rambunctious conference for standing up to Putin; he’d rather say the GOP stood up to help Israel than put anyone in the MAGA camp in the uncomfortable position of having to back Ukraine aid if they want to stand with Israel, or having to vote down aid for Israel if they so staunchly oppose American help for those fighting for their freedom and independence in Ukraine.There’s nothing inherently right about combining two costly foreign aid spending measures in a single bill — but Johnson likely wants to separate the two so he never has to bother bringing Ukraine aid to the floor at all, even though it most certainly has majority support. Moreover, Johnson’s approach to separate the two and demand IRS-slashing offsets will go nowhere in the Senate, as it shouldn’t.Yoking the Israel aid and IRS cuts together makes the speaker’s cynical maneuver impossible, so — especially in light of rapidly approaching funding deadlines — it’s a wholly understandable step.Either Johnson and Republicans should accept a single, combined bill helping Israel and Ukraine alike in their moment of need, or they should commit to bringing both bills to the House floor, even if that means their passage will depend in part on Democratic votes. Johnson must fear he’d risk the speaker’s gavel should some Republicans rebel.Two American allies are desperate for help.

Referring specifically to the strategic partnership between the World Economic Forum (WEF and the United Nations (U.N. and centered around the global policy publication called the2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,one can concur that it involves strategies using the 20-year-old philosophy known as “replacement migration.” The tactics to force migrants into regions and nations of choice as “agents of change and enablers for development in countries of origin, transit and destination” are documented in the U.N.-funded report calledMigration in the 2030 Agenda, put forward by the U.N. migration agency, detailing the specific agenda for the “Diasporas”; claiming that the migrants will act “in accordance with the beneficiary of the ends of sustainable development (e.g. through greater protections, rights and transparency . “Within the U.N. 2030 agenda are policy implications that specifically focus on the means of disarming nation-states of their sovereignty for global climate change policies. However, there are several alarm-raising sovereignty issues within the framework because America is Independent and does not adhere to foreign entities but adheres only to the American people as power and decision-makers. One discrepancy to the sovereignty of the United States can be found in article 46 of the U.N. 2030 Agenda, which it declares that “while stressing the importance of strengthened national ownership and leadership … we express our support for the ongoing dialogue in the economic and social council on the long-term positioning of the U.N. development system in the context of this agenda”; therefore, declaring that the dialogue for long-term will be United Nations control over “economic growth and social direction.”As many migrant centers are already active across the nation of America, be prepared to see many more open closer to home, especially in C40 cities, as seen in June of this year in our nation’s capital of D.C. This change in migration comes from the Biden Administration ending ofTitle 42 admission,that held migrants in Mexico while they waited for entrance.

suffolknewsherald_2023_199,"Published 5:24 pm Friday, September 8, 2023ByStaff ReportsMonday, Sept. 11, marks the 22nd anniversary of 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Let’s pause for a few minutes to remember the victims and their families.We pray, “Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them. May the soul of our faithful departed brothers and sisters, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.”A Day of Reflection and Remembrance is a fitting and proper way or description to observe the significance of 9/11, which changed the world to be united, together as one big human family longing for peace not war, order not chaos, love not hatred, for one another. It’s a solemn memorial of the U.S. history’s deadliest terrorist attacks on American soil.Our young generation needs to know what, why and how it happened on that fateful day, which claimed almost three thousand lives lost (about 2,977 as of this time , thousands injure, and billions of dollars worth of property destroyed. But no amount of money can replace the innocent lives lost.The facts we learned: 19 men hijacked four planes, three of which were used to strike significant U.S. sites. American Airlines flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175 were flown into the World Trade Center’s north and south towers, respectively, and American Airlines flight 77 hit the Pentagon. The fourth aircraft, United Airlines flight 93, crashed into an open field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. The 19 hijackers were affiliated with Islamist terrorist organization al-Qaeda, 15 of them from Saudi Arabia, two from United Arab Emirates, and one from Egypt and one from Lebanon.On that Tuesday morning in 2001, I was in the personnel lounge room, busy working on our radiology department’s training files or records (both military and civilian personnel at the First and Finest Naval Medical Center in Portsmouth.Retired U.S. Navy Chief Thomas came into the lounge room and hurriedly turned on the TV. There it was: the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers under attack by a plane on one side and another on the other side of the tower, like watching a live filming of a movie. But it was the actual happening of such terrible attacks.The room, eventually, was full of our staff-personnel. All you could hear was “O my God, Noooo!” I prayed silently. Somebody in the room switched the channel to another TV station for another perspective. After about 30 minutes passed, our personnel slowly faded, with misty eyes. I was left alone in the lounge room, sad, upset, confused, puzzled, perplexed, perturbed. I kept asking myself Why? Why did it happen? I didn’t have any answer to my question at that time.As a Catholic, I was humbled to know later that among the first responders to the site was a beloved American Franciscan friar and Catholic priest who served as a chaplain to the New York City Fire Department. His name was Father Mychal Judge, O.F.M. (Latin for “Ordo Fratrum Minorum,” or Orders of Friar Minor .Father Mychal refused to move to safety saying that he needed to be with his men. He entered the tower and remained in the lobby, praying for firefighters, who rushed past him and up the stairs and for office workers plunging to their deaths outside. He was killed by falling debris, after administering the last rites to a dying firefighter. He became the first certified fatality of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Father Mychal was hailed as an American hero. Many have considered him a living saint, because of his extraordinary works of charity and deep spirituality even before his death. The Orthodox-Catholic of America declared him a saint on July 27, 2002. However, there wasn’t any official message from the Vatican City, the Archdiocese of New York and the Franciscan Third Order regarding his canonization process.What did I learn from 9/11? Life is precious; it’s the only important gift we have from our Creator. Live life faithfully and lawfully, and use it to help humanity’s pressing problems and concerns. Live in the present moment well. Without any reservation, do your best to serve and help others. Pray, give thanks always, and offer your pains and problems to Jesus, our Lord, God and Savior. Be generous and kind. Share what you have — talents, time, and treasure — to others. Pray, hope, don’t worry.The 9/11 Memorial and Museum reminds us of that day. It’s located at the site of the former World Trade Center complex and occupies approximately half of the 16-acre site. The memorial’s twin reflecting pools are each nearly an acre in size and feature the largest man-made waterfalls in North America.Seven stories below the Memorial is the Museum which contains artifacts, first-person accounts, and multimedia displays and exhibitions about the Sept 11, 2001 attacks. Names of the victims were inscribed on the Memorial’s bronze parapets.For the families of all victims of 9/11, we hope and pray for a peaceful closure, new possibilities in life.

Traffic there has always been heavy around 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. because of school, making it difficult to make a turn there. Sometimes, people have to wait several minutes. Since the opening of the Amazon centers, it has gotten even worse, with a lot of traffic in that area between 5:30 and 6 p.m. as well. Sometimes, when people make the turns, it almost causes accidents. In fact, there have been a couple of bad accidents there already, one of them involving a school bus. It looks like they are going to widen Nansemond Pkwy in the area around the school, which would help to move the traffic through, but a light would certainly shorten the wait times for people turning and those behind them, and make the travel much safer for everyone in that area.Braden WillisOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Locally, Virginia passed legislation that allowed for funding of private schools in the case that public schools were closed to avoid integration.Thousands dropped out of school after the law requiring attendance was repealed. State Sen. Ted Dalton said there were indications that thousands of children dropped out at public schools when the legislature repealed the compulsory attendance law in January.The senator, Virginia’s top Republican, said repeal of the compulsory attendance law “struck a blow for ignorance.” “It’s not anti-integration legislation — it is anti-education legislation,” he said. Dalton added that if the legislature is not willing to reenact the law on a statewide basis, it at least should give localities the authority to enact local compulsory attendance laws.Elsewhere, the Alabama Ku Klux Klan tried to rid school libraries of children’s books. “The Rabbits’ Wedding’’ was removed from general circulation after a bitter legislative fight. It is a story about the marriage of a black rabbit and a white rabbit. “Two is a Team,’’ an illustrated tale by Lorraine and Jerrold Beim, tells of a Black boy and a white boy who are playmates. It pictures them visiting each other’s homes and playing with other children of both races. These were among several the Klan fought to ban from schools.Schools were not the only institution being pressured to integrate.In March 1960, 75 students were arrested for disorderly conduct after lunch counter demonstrations. Black students and youth staged large demonstrations in three Southern states as part of the campaign for equal rights at eating places.A couple weeks later, more than 500 Black people were arrested in the largest mass police action since demonstrations against segregated eating facilities in the South began in February 1960. Police in Orangeburg, South Carolina, used tear gas and fire hoses to quell an estimated 1,000 demonstrating students and arrested 350 of them.On the international stage, the Cold War was heating up quickly. Tensions between the United States and Soviet Union increased steadily through the end of the ’50s and into the beginning of the ’60s. Cuba was a main pawn in the tense power struggle. It was pointed out as a Soviet base. In October 1960, the United States banned all exports to Cuba except certain medical supplies and foods. In preparation for potential war, both the United States and Soviets began long-range rocket tests. Other technology in weapons and surveillance was tested constantly.Another aspect of the Cold War was the space race. Every week seemed to bring either sky-high achievements or devastating disasters in the space rocket business.Two monkeys, Baker and Able, rode a U.S. rocket to space and back. Both survived the journey; however, Able died during an operation to remove electrodes after their return.NASA announced in August 1960 that three men would be aboard the U.S. “Project Apollo” spaceship, which was planned to circle the moon sometime between 1965 and 1970.On Oct. 5 the United States launched its newest satellite — a veritable chatterbox in the sky. It whipped around the world, paving the way for a space-age communications system for U.S military forces.The developments in technology weren’t limited to space travel — developments in computers were underway.Machines capable of learning are on the way, an Army study project said. “The goal, of course, is to make the computer behave more like the human planner,” Julius Brick said. “This is the direction in which computer designers will be heading for some time.”In 1959, Hawaii became the 50th state. On July 4, 1960, the 50-star flag became official.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_35,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Nearly two years ago, Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine unified European nations, reinvigorated the trans-Atlantic alliance and forged a spirit of rare bipartisanship in Washington. Now that resolve is fraying. President Joe Biden’s administration and the European Union are struggling to deliver aid for Ukraine’s military and budget, with even some of the country’s staunchest supporters expressing doubts about its battlefield prospects and calling for negotiations to end the war.This frustration is perhaps understandable, but it’s misguided. It ignores the enormous sacrifices Ukraine’s people have made to defend their freedom and push back against Russian aggression — and underestimates the ability of Ukraine’s military to regain the advantage, if given sufficient weaponry. Abandoning the war effort now would wreck the West’s credibility and ultimately endanger the democracies supporting Ukraine’s defense as much as Ukraine itself.It’s true that Ukraine’s forces failed to advance this year as much as leaders inside and outside the country had hoped for. Russia’s defensive capabilities and willingness to absorb huge casualties have proved formidable. And while there is much finger-pointing between Ukraine and the West about tactics and decision-making, the supply of weaponry was too little and too late.Acknowledging these shortcomings is very different from defeatism. The answer isn’t to do less. Putin shows no interest in negotiations or any history of abiding by agreements he’s made. He has every reason to wait for US and European resolve to collapse so that he can complete his objective of subjugating Ukraine. In this war of attrition, the West must adapt its response to provide more sustainable support over the long term.What should that entail? In the coming months, providing additional ammunition, long-range missiles, air-defense systems, drones and fighter aircraft will remain essential. Without the continued flow of Western arms, Ukraine will be unable to hold onto the territory it controls, let alone seize more. At the same time, the US and Europe should ramp up Ukraine’s own ability to produce weapons by providing incentives for joint ventures with Ukrainian defense companies to build drone factories, anti-mining equipment and other defense-industrial capacities.Ukraine also needs renewed budgetary support, which should be tied to continued demands on Ukraine’s government for transparency and reform. The EU’s decision to start the long process of membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova sends the right message of commitment. Meanwhile, the West should tighten sanctions against Russia and build better enforcement mechanisms to strengthen the price cap on Russian oil and block the Kremlin’s ability to import dual-use technologies. While Russia’s economy has found ways to adapt, sanctions are necessary to maintain pressure on Putin and send a signal of solidarity.Democratic leaders must also do a better job of communicating at home. It bears repeating that Putin’s invasion is a wholly unprovoked war in which the intention is conquest, prosecuted through deliberate attacks on civilian centers and war crimes.It’s impossible to predict when and how the war will end. But defeat would carry steep strategic costs, damage global food and energy security, and embolden Putin to go further. However daunting the challenges faced by Ukraine and its partners in the year ahead, failure isn’t an option.— Bloomberg Opinion"

It’s the person.” And the “person” is armed to the teeth with weaponry and full up on the ideology that the gun is how we solve problems in Amerikkka because politicians say it’s okay and celebrities shoot beer cans on social media.The brainwashed minions of these politicians are on the internet right now, as I type, deflecting blame to Democratic mayors, crime in Chicago streets, and Black gun violence, when none of these things bears any direct relation to this event — but ignorance is a virus that spreads like dandelion seeds.As we find ourselves, yet again, in mourning, asking each other why and wondering if and when this will ever stop, politicians stroll casually by the rivers of American blood, counting their special interest dollars and planning their next tropical vacations as they sell away our families and our safety.Just know that they won’t change until we make them change. Just as these new families today will join a club they never wanted to be a part of where they will cry until their chests cave in from grief and lose sleep, each politician in the statehouses around this nation should never have a peaceful day until something happens, and until Americans aren’t the price for their luxury.“Elaine and I are devastated by the news coming out of Louisville this morning. Thank you to LMPD and our first responders for your bravery at the scene. We send our prayers to the victims, their families, and the city of Louisville as we await more information,” tweeted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Louisville resident and National Rifle Association darling to the tune of over $1.2 million.McConnell’s fellow Republican Rand Paul, though somewhat less popular with the NRA, sends his thoughts and prayers: “Kelley and I are praying for everyone involved in the deadly shooting in downtown Louisville this morning. Our hearts break for the families of those lost.”Kentucky Republicans have offered little to no help in controlling the escalating gun violence in America, much less in their own state, and here we are again, another tragedy with only their “thoughts and prayers” or silence.Democratic officials of the state have had more substantial words and actions as this tragedy has unfolded. U.S. Representative Morgan McGarvey spoke with local news at some length about the shooting and said he will be coming home to Louisville to be with his city and help with resources. Governor Andy Beshear came to the city after the event and will work on the ground in Louisville in the aftermath of the shooting. Beshear told the media during his press conference this morning that he had lost close friends in the shooting. Everyone here is affected and will be affected by this loss.Louisville, we love you so very much and we are hurting with you.Not a lot else to say for America. As a country, we’re a fucking embarrassment.*** ."
eugeneweekly_2023_54,"We ve got issues. This city touts itself as a progressive-minded, inclusive community, but if you pay attention, this can show up as white, elitist, NIMBY liberalism. Eugene is overwhelmingly white, making up 81.1 percent of the population, according to recent census data; so how can we pretend to call ourselves diverse or inclusive? Sure, visitors in town will notice Pride flags and Black Lives Matter signs in the windows of local businesses, but after staying awhile they’d notice how attitudes toward marginalized communities are, at best, blissfully ignorant, and at worst, disdainful; the city’s treatment of the unhoused community is a perfect example. Remember the World Athletics Championships debacle last summer? The city did its best to ensure there was little evidence of our growing unhoused population, yet failed to attract the thousands of visitors to any local businesses outside of the University of Oregon area. Huge fumble. White liberalism shows up in Eugene in several ways, but one that isn’t discussed enough is the alarming number of anti-Asian incidents my loved ones have experienced here. As a mixed-race but white-passing, middle class, educated woman, I recognize the privilege that allows me to thrive here, but my Taiwanese mother experiences discrimination in this town on a regular basis — exacerbated by the increased xenophobia towards Asians emerging from the pandemic. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Some of my mom’s experiences: When out with friends, being told to “speak English” and receiving sub-par service compared to other patrons, specifically at a few notable 5th Street Public Market businesses; moving from her condo after experiencing discrimination from her neighbors, including one woman yelling, “Go back to China” from her window; people scowling and covering their faces during the peak of COVID-19 upon seeing my mom’s Asian features, despite being outside and dozens of yards away (and not doing the same with me ; a grocery store employee refusing to let her use coupons because he “couldn’t understand what she was saying.” The list goes on. Milder examples include the classic microaggressions of people speaking loudly and slowly to her, and the need for me to accompany her during large purchases to ensure she isn’t being taken advantage of (in which case the salesperson pointedly talks to me instead of her, despite it being her dollars to spend . A more serious example includes local Asian organizations canceling gatherings due to fear of violence, including my mom canceling Lunar New Year plans with her local Taiwanese group after the recent shootings in L.A. If your first thought after reading that sentence was, “Wasn’t the shooter also Asian?” you might be in the “blissful ignorance” group I mentioned earlier. Regardless of the color of the person’s skin, hate crimes like this are fueled by structural racism and indicate a systemic issue in the way people of color are treated in this country. Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that tracks and responds to incidents of hate toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI in the United States, reported 11,467 hate incidents between March 19, 2020, and March 31, 2022, and found that “one in five Asian Americans and one in five Pacific Islanders experienced a hate incident in 2020 or 2021.” If your reaction to that was, “What a shame,” I urge you to consider what it would be like to live in fear because you or someone you love happens to look Asian. This is not just shameful. It’s terrifying. If you asked someone in town how Asian culture shows up in Eugene, they would probably comment on the food options we have, of which there are many, though some have been vandalized repeatedly. Perhaps they would mention the annual Asian Celebration. Maybe their kid learned about Lunar New Year in school. What else? We are more than our food and yearly celebrations. Where is the (non-tokenized representation in our city? Our government? Our school boards? Who will speak up about the anti-Asian hate happening not only on a national level, but in our own community? It can’t be the sole responsibility of the local AAPI community, so I’m asking you to take action, as well. Anti-racism begins with self-awareness, so consider these self-reflection questions: Is your knowledge of AAPI culture limited to food and Lunar New Year? Do you have AAPI representation in your social circles? Do you follow AAPI creatives? When was the last time you read a book, watched a film or listened to music from the AAPI community? When you were in school, did you have AAPI teachers? Do your children have AAPI teachers? If you use social media, do you follow AAPI content creators? What is your first thought when you encounter someone of AAPI descent? What do you believe the AAPI population contributes to our local community? My mom has lived in this country for over 40 years and worked hard to earn her citizenship. How much longer must she wait to be fully embraced by her local community? Alicia Balfrey is an Asian American Eugene resident and received her master’s from the University of Oregon. She works in special education to provide training to teachers and serves as her organization’s diversity manager."

It is the second recent statewide poll in which strong majorities of Virginia voters supported expansion of behavioral health care access. A survey of Virginia voters conducted in January by co/efficient found that more than 76% of respondents wanted cooperation between the Virginia House of Delegates and the state Senate to approve a package of proposed state budget amendments to fund mental health treatment.As with the co/efficient poll, the Mason-Dixon survey found that support is strong across demographic groups, including gender (86% support among women, 82% among men , political party (96% support among Democrats, 79% among Republicans and 76% by independents , every age bracket and ethnic group, and every geographic region of Virginia.In December, Gov.

That’s 1,400 people each and every year on average.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2022, more people in the United States died due to tobacco use than homicide, car crashes, alcohol and COVID-19 combined. While all these other causes of death are found on the nightly news, we never hear about those that suffer and die from tobacco-related illnesses. That’s why the Hawaii County Youth Commission and the Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Hawaii Youth Council stand together in strong support of County Council Bill 102 to end the sale of flavored tobacco products.We understand that ending the sale of flavored tobacco products impacts adults as well, but Bill 102 isn’t about adults — it’s about our keiki and the future of Hawaii. Adults will still have tobacco-flavored products to use, but flavors like Hawaiian POG, Luau Punch and Strawberry-Kiwi are clearly exploiting our culture and targeting our youth. These delicious flavors are masking the harsh taste of tobacco products, making it easier to attract and hook kids, while making it harder for them to quit.Menthol can be found in most e-cigarette flavors under the names Frosty, Ice and Chill. It’s also the cigarette of choice for youth in Hawaii and disproportionately impacts Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders — 78% of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islander smokers smoke menthol cigarettes.Ninety-five percent of smokers start before the age of 21, and 8 in 10 youth who have ever tried a tobacco product started with a flavored product. In fact, high school and middle school students in Hawaii County have the highest use of e-cigarettes amongst all of the counties in the state, making this an issue Hawaii County needs to address. By continuing to allow the tobacco industry to sell their flavored products, we allow them to expand their market and addict another generation of our keiki.We want to make sure that youth are educated about the dangers of tobacco use and the role flavors play in luring and addicting them. It’s something that members of the Youth Council and other community groups are working on, but education alone won’t solve the youth vaping crisis. We need strong policies in place as well.One thing we don’t want to see is youth being penalized for their addiction after they have fallen victim to the tobacco industry’s marketing. What they need is not just our help to quit but assistance in preventing them from ever becoming addicted in the first place. That’s why we ask the Hawaii County Council to support our keiki by supporting Bill 102.Kyla-Marie TurnerHawaii County Youth CommissionJensel Merice JoseCoalition for a Tobacco-Free Hawaii Youth Council"
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_62,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°In a letter to Secretary of State Tony Blinken and a Senate resolution, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is calling to cancel the visas of, and deport, any noncitizens who in his estimation have shown support for Hamas terrorism.It’s a resolution and not a bill because a law already exists, making anyone who “endorses or espouses terrorist activity” inadmissible or deportable from the country. It is, for good reason, interpreted relatively narrowly, generally only applying to people who are or have been openly involved in designated terrorist organizations or specifically call for terrorist groups to carry out violence.Rubio, of course, wouldn’t send a letter demanding that the federal government act on a law that he believed it was already in compliance with, which necessarily means that what he wants is for there to be much broader use of the provision. More simply, Rubio wants visa holders — students and teachers, doctors, executives, farmworkers, people of all stripes — to be evaluated for suspected terrorist sympathies and cracked down on if they’re deemed to have any.The senator is very helpful in explaining he wants this done for every single one of the millions of visa holders here, writing that the law presents “a clear directive to institute a thorough review of all visa holders and applicants. This should include coordination with law enforcement, both federal and state/local, as well as universities.” He does not, however, include any specificity about what he views as sufficiently “endorsing or espousing” Hamas to trigger these provisions. His direct reference to universities gives us a strong clue.Students and faculty at colleges and universities around the country have clashed over the conflict, with some making statements or signing letters that have, among other things, placed the blame for the Hamas attacks directly on Israel. Stupid as that position might be, it is protected speech taking place on higher education campuses, long the loci of political debate and envelope-pushing. Efforts by donors to have universities condemn or punish students who’ve criticized Israel, or have these students blackballed from employment, are a matter of choice; dangling the specter of a visa cancellation is another level.Is, for example, saying that Israel triggered the attack via its Gaza policy not just boneheaded but actively “endorsing” Hamas terrorism? You could make the argument, and what Rubio is really trying to do is keep that question open so international students and visa-holding faculty will just say nothing rather than risk the potentially very steep consequences of immigration scrutiny. The irony shouldn’t be lost on anyone that just months ago he sponsored a bill to ostensibly “protect free speech on college campuses.”We’ll remind Rubio of one little wrinkle: the Constitution, whose First Amendment guarantees a right to expression for everyone on U.S. soil. While we don’t want to have stringent purity tests for entry, evaluating visa applications from abroad should carry more discretion; stateside, though, it’s a very dangerous path to go down to start chilling speech with the threat of government enforcement, no matter how much we might detest that speech.Either Rubio should clarify exactly what he means, and under which circumstances people should be targeted for their speech, or he should be the one to shut up about it.—New York Daily News Editorial BoardHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2023_137,"Published 6:25 pm Friday, February 3, 2023ByLetters to the EditorEditor:I am writing regarding the long-term future recommendations for Nansemond River High School as noted in the facility master plan. The three options outlined included zero cost to rezone, $15 million to add on, or $119 million to replace the building.My parents attended Nansemond River when it was first built in the 90s. Our entire family feels both extreme pride for the school and great respect for the quality of education we received. As a current senior, however, I can attest that the school’s infrastructure is outdated and needs repair, the building is overcrowded, the technology needs upgrading, and the security measures in place are inadequate to meet the safety needs of faculty and students. For these reasons, I believe the long-term goal of our city should be to replace Nansemond River High School.According to the Schools Facility Needs Assessment and Attendance Zone Design Executive Summary, the population of the school has grown by 13% over five years and is projected to continue to increase. Furthermore, Nansemond River has a current student population of 1,688, which represents an overall capacity of 107%.While rezoning might diminish the overcrowding, the infrastructure, technological issues and security measures at the school would still remain inadequate. In addition, even if the size of Nansemond River is increased by adding square footage at an estimated cost of $15 million, the greater part of the building would still remain outdated and in need of repair.The Executive Summary gives Nansemond River a rating of 10.71 on the Facility Condition Index, indicating the infrastructure is in fair condition with some functional challenges that will require both minor and major repairs. The cost of these deferred maintenance repairs is projected to be $21,159,794 over 10 years. In addition, $8,667,131 is a high priority cost that needs to be addressed over the next three years.Although the cost to rebuild Nansemond River High School at about $119 million dollars is greater than the cost to renovate, the value will be realized with a lower cost of ongoing maintenance, accommodations for technological needs, and the increased safety and security measures that are a part of modern school designs.If our city wants to continue to attract highly educated workers that will fuel both economic growth and tax revenues, the condition of the public schools must be a high priority for the school board and the city council. Parents want what’s best for their children.Upcoming high school students deserve an expanded learning experience that must include the newest technological applications and the best safety and security measures.I believe that the quality of life for both teachers and students would be enhanced with a new learning environment. I hope the city will consider the long-term option to rebuild Nansemond River High School in order to serve the citizens of Suffolk and future Warriors for years to come.Emma HarschSuffolkCorbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

This might cause a lot of emotions to pop up but stick with them, even if they are uncomfortable or overwhelming.

You may decide that you want to continue your relationship with X, or you may choose to end it. I would, however, suggest that you hold off on the sex until after you’ve made the decision. If the original relationship was “passionate and tumultuous,”the amorous arts might cloud your judgment.Whatever you decide, I hope it brings you peace.Dear Oracle,I recently started hanging out with a new group of friends, who I really like.

Most schools, especially middle schools and high schools, have a website for students and a website for parents. Both of these sites can be reviewed for homework assignments, a syllabus and grades. A daily check for paper homework assignments may be needed if these sites are unavailable at a particular school.These websites are a great way to know what is due and when, but they only help you help your student if you monitor them frequently. Assignments can be updated often, so a review is needed often. These sites can also help you see if there is an area in which your student is struggling. A few minutes each day to review homework assignments, upcoming projects, and posted grades will help you understand where help or encouragement may be needed.Keeping up to date with homework assignments shouldn’t be entirely your responsibility. Your student must understand how to review the needed work, how it needs to be completed and the due date for each assignment.Middle school and high school students should be capable of learning how to review their assignments and staying up to date with what is needed. Students should be learning responsibility and understand that it is up to them to ensure they are staying up to date and completing all required assignments.Students taking responsibility for their own work doesn’t mean that parents should take a hands-off approach. It should be a side-by-side approach. Students will need support, encouragement, and someone to hold them accountable. They may even need correction and consequences to help them along the way.Every school, family and student is different, so there is no one way to ensure your student is staying up to date in school. However, no matter the school’s communication style and your student’s personality, it will take communication with the school and your student. It will take work on your part, and you must continually ensure that your student is doing what he or she needs to do. You owe it to your student not to allow them to get behind and to do all you can to help them reach their greatest potential.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_158,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°What the hell was that?Ostensibly, Thursday’s debate between California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is not running for president, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is, was supposed to be an exploration of the ideological differences between the two chief executives.After all, one is the embodiment of progressive, blue-state policies and a high-profile surrogate for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The other represents the younger, less orange face of Planet MAGA, and, as it became clear, can’t pronounce “Kamala” correctly.Twenty minutes in, however, I had a headache. There was so much cross-talk and interrupting — by both governors — that it was impossible to hear what they were saying.If a third debater had been onstage, they almost certainly would have piped up, “See folks, this is why those two should not be on this debate stage.”It was actually pretty funny that Sean Hannity, an unabashed supporter of former President Donald Trump who engineered this overhyped meeting of ideological opposites, positioned himself as the grownup in the room, the guy who wanted to take the temperature down a few notches in order to get his loaded questions answered.“Let each other breathe,” pleaded Hannity. “I don’t want to be the hall monitor.” Don’t worry, Sean, you weren’t. He prefaced one of his loaded questions thus: “Joe Biden has experienced significant cognitive decline.”DeSantis performed better than I expected against the voluble Newsom, who has two decades of political experience to DeSantis’ one. In three previous Republican debates, DeSantis failed to distinguish himself, appearing almost wimpy next to the verbally muscular former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has overtaken him in polls.(Which probably explains why he agreed to debate Newsom after refusing to for most of the past year. He landed well-deserved blows about California’s infamous, and well-acknowledged, problems — homelessness, in particular.The problem with this spectacle was that too many incompatible things were simultaneously going on: The flailing DeSantis was trying to reestablish himself as a viable GOP alternative in the event that Trump’s felony indictments make him, finally, unpalatable to Republican voters.Newsom was trying to raise his national political profile, defend the Biden-Harris record and argue that California is a better place to live than Florida. (Which, of course, it is. Did Newsom have anything to lose? Not really.Yes, we all know that California is expensive, and that for the first time in forever, more people are leaving than coming in. Yes, we had lockdowns during the pandemic. This was the gist of DeSantis’ argument that he’s the better governor.And yet, as Newsom pointed out, more Floridians have recently moved to California than Californians to Florida.“There is one thing that we have in common,” said Newsom. “Neither of us will be the nominee for our party in 2024.”Oh snap."

philinquirer_2023_3,"Beyoncé’s music helped me through my struggles as an LGBTQ teen, and she has supported me as a transgender adult. I have been a part of the Beyoncé BeyHive since before the hive was even a thing. The Queen B’s music helped introduce me to myself. In the summer of 1999, as the world rocked to a new album by Destiny’s Child, I was embracing my true identity as a transgender teen. I felt like the tracks “Say My Name” and “Sweet Sixteen” were written for me. When I was 16 years old, I was unhoused, running away from my safety net because it was no longer safe for me as a trans teenager at home. As I sought affirmation of my trans identity, I fell for people who would tell me anything to get what they wanted — both my age and older men. At 20, finally finding some stability, four years into my blossoming and wanting love, being so ready that I was blind, and being dangerously in love with another person, I forgot to love myself. That year, Beyoncé’s debut solo album,Dangerously In Love, reassured me to put myself first. I can track the many seasons of my life in Beyoncé albums.B’Dayin 2006 sent me to the clubs and had me feeling myself. I dug out that “Freakum Dress” from the depths of the closet that gave my body life so hot you had to ring the alarms. Beyoncé’s music helped me blossom into my womanhood. When I listen to her music, I can feel my teenage loves moving into full-on adult heartbreak. In her lyrics, I found the value in who I am as a woman. I learned to have standards. Beyoncé taught me that there is power in my flaws and that it is a privilege to use my femininity to achieve all that I desire. Now, as a 39-year-old trans woman, it’s like Bey and I grew up with each other. I see Beyoncé as my big sister, teaching me the ropes and helping me thrive through society’s expectations and its lack of tolerance and acceptance. These standards lead so many people — especially those who seek to be accepted — to take extreme measures to fit in or to self-medicate to escape the feelings of not being accepted. If I let the data speak the truth in my life, then I shouldn’t be here. I couch surfed as a teen. I am a survivor of physical harm and sexual assault and self-medication. I played ring around the rosie with the Philadelphia jail system. I allowed the stigma and a lack of understanding and inclusion to present a barrier for me to achieve my greatness. But, as always, Beyoncé stepped in to save me. In 2011, herfourth studio album, titled4, was on repeat. By this time, I was finally seeing the power I always had within myself. I stopped allowing the stigma against trans women to dictate my future. With Beyoncé’s music as a guide, I started pushing myself through barriers in my life so that I could leave a lasting mark: I was here. I gave. I loved. I lived. After being fired for a technical violation on a job application by identifying as female instead of male, I found my voice to fight for what I needed: dignity and human rights. In each of the last three decades, Beyoncé’s music has played an instrumental role in identifying my femininity, reclaiming my power, and using that power to thrive. Now, I embrace my flaws. I seek validation only in myself. I set my own standards for what I desire out of life. I have dealt with breakups, self-awareness, love, and spirituality in every word shared through the lyrics of the many albums curated by this talented artist. Beyoncé helped me through my struggles as an LGBTQ teen, and she has supported me as a transgender adult. To the BeyHive in Philly and those coming to the Linc to share space with Beyoncé, enjoy the moment, and remember this is the City of Love. I am there in spirit. Naiymah Sanchez is a proud transgender BeyHive Philadelphian."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_23,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Usually, when Martin Luther King’s words are misappropriated, the culprits are misinformation mercenaries trying to advance some right-wing idea that is light years away from King’s ideology,Their favorite is King’s “I Have A Dream” speech, in which King said people should be judged by “the content of their character” and not “the color of their skin,” poetic phrases perversely twisted to pretend that King would have fought against something as righteous as affirmative action.So when video of King surfaced online last week denouncing antisemitism and backing Israel’s right to exist, the source and the timing put a lot of people on edge.For weeks, after the terrorist group Hamas launched a bloody attack against Israel, comedian Amy Schumer has expressed support for Israel’s retaliation effort, and has even hinted that calls for a ceasefire are antisemitic.Her social media posts included a video of King standing up for Israel and shouting down antisemitism and other forms of discrimination.“Israel must exist and has a right to exist and is one of the great outposts of democracy in the world,” King says in one of the videos.In another clip, the civil rights leader denounces antisemitism as “wrong” and says “it’s unjust and it’s evil.”Certainly, no right-thinking person would disagree. Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel was evil and wrong, and any physical or verbal attacks on Jews that have followed are just as vile.But context is key, and Schumer’s decision to use King’s words — sacred to the eyes and ears of many — is dangerous, and only adds fuel to the firebombs.The backlash was swift. Among those responding was King’s own daughter, Bernice King, CEO of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, and protector of the King legacy.“Amy: Certainly, my father was against antisemitism, as am I,” King’s daughter tweeted. “He also believed militarism (along with racism and poverty to be among the interconnected Triple Evils. I am certain he would call for Israel’s bombing of Palestinians to cease, for hostages to be released, and for us to work for true peace, which includes justice.“He said, ‘Justice at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love.’”Since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, 1,400 people have been killed in Israel and 240 are being held hostage, according to Israeli officials. More than 1 million people have been displaced in Gaza, where Palestinian health officials have said more than 8,700 have been killed, most of them women and children.Countless humanitarian groups including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have urgently called for a ceasefire.Bernice King was correct to call Schumer out on the quotes, but she didn’t stop there. She posted her own MLK video, one in which her father urges the U.S. to withdraw from Vietnam.“We don’t need to prove to anybody our military power,” King says in the clip.“We need to prove our moral power.”Israel, like King said, has a right to exist. It also has a right to defend itself.But indiscriminate bombing that results in endless civilian casualties isn’t justice. It’s vengeance. And, God said, “Vengence is mine.”"
eugeneweekly_2023_42,"We ve got issues. As a 22-year teaching veteran in 4J and a mother of a current 4J student, I am writing to express my concerns about the proposed new high school schedule and to urge the Eugene School District 4J to address these concerns before finalizing and implementing the schedule in September. Currently 4J high schools offer three trimesters of five classes every school year (for most traditional students , and full-time teachers teach four of five classes. For example, I currently teach four Spanish classes and have one period as my “prep.” I see my students every day, and a “year” of Spanish consists of two trimesters — 24 weeks — of Spanish with about 8,200 minutes of instruction. While there is no “perfect schedule,” 4J has been using the current model with relative efficacy for the last 10 years; 4J’s graduation rate for the 2021–22 school year was 80.8 percent, the second-highest in its history. However, the new schedule will have two semesters of eight classes each every school year (for most traditional students , with students seeing their teachers two days a week for instruction, and one additional “contact-time” day where no new instruction or assessment is permitted. This means the new schedule has students in instructional time with their teacher for only 6,000 minutes for a year-long — 36-week — class. This is asignificantreduction in time for instruction and student-teacher relationship building. Both my anecdotal experiences and peer-reviewed research, based on countless educational studies done over decades, overwhelmingly support as much consistent, daily contact between teachers and students as possible to promote social-emotional skills and academic knowledge. Further, full-time teachers would teach six of eight classes on the new schedule. Teachers who were working part time at .75 on the old schedule teaching three classes would next year conceivably teach .67 time and teach four classes (meaning teaching more classes next year and being paid less! This means that fewer teachers will be “needed” to “cover” the courses taught previously, which ideally could lead to lower class sizes. But 4J has announced that class sizes will actuallygo upby 7 to 8 percent on average as teaching positions are cut across the four traditional high schools. Again, we know that class size is a crucial component to student success for the same reasons I stated above regarding student-teacher contact time. Since the pandemic, 4J has responded admirably to helping our students care for their mental health. At the same time, at South Eugene High School we have suffered a disproportionately high rate of student suicide deaths since the pandemic started. I care deeply for my students’ and my daughter’s mental health, and I wonder how increasing the number of classes they are taking at a time (from five to eight is going to adversely affect their mental and physical health, knowing that many teachers plan to increase homework loads to offset the 27 percent reduction in instructional time. Also, I worry how this will negatively impact students on Individualized Education and 504 Plans who are losing time with their case managers and support classes (a federal right under IDEA , while at the same time adding more academic work? I understand the explicit intent of the new schedule is to better serve traditionally marginalized populations such as students with learning disabilities, students of color and students in poverty. I myself advise South’s Latinx Student Union to help students find a safe place at school to celebrate their heritage and to share it with others, in order to create a stronger community school-wide. But for the reasons I’ve listed, I emphatically disagree that the proposed new schedule will help more students than the current model we are using, and I expect 4J’s administrators to recognize and remedy the problems that the stakeholders (teachers, classified staff, building administrators and, most importantly, our students and families are greatly concerned about for next year."
suffolknewsherald_2023_25,"Published 4:28 pm Tuesday, June 13, 2023ByJen JaquaThe years of 1967 and 1968 were rife with protests and turmoil around the nation. News from the front lines in Vietnam was grim. Daily, the front page held war reports of bombings and troop action. There were several reports of local men killed in action and missing. Further stories highlight awards received by locals, including the Purple Heart.A relic of a war that never came to fruition was headed for a brighter future. In April 1967, a Nike Missile site was acquired by Nansemond County to be made into a park with a possible boat ramp and picnic shelters. It is now Bennett’s Creek Park.The conflict of the world wasn’t restricted to the war overseas.Riots for open housing and other civil rights erupted violently around the country. On Aug. 30, open-housing demonstrators in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, returned to their headquarters after a night of protests and watched it ravaged by flames. Fire officials said the fire that destroyed the headquarters of the Milwaukee Youth Council of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was caused by an arsonist. The blaze erupted less than an hour after Youth Council members, led by their adviser, the Rev. James E. Groppi, a white Roman Catholic priest, escaped from a white throng police estimated at 13,000. The hecklers spilled over sidewalks along the 22-block route that took the marchers deep into the predominantly Polish South Side. The mob, chanting “kill, kill, kill,” hurled insults, bottles and rocks at the 200 marchers. Police said 45 people were arrested. Twenty-two people were injured, 11 of them policemen.Assassins took several victims within months of each other, prompting legislation to be passed on mail-order guns.On April 4, 1968, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed. And then on June 5, 1968 Robert Kennedy was shot and killed, shortly after winning the California presidential primary.Segregation was still a battle being fought here in Suffolk.In October 1967, although schools had been integrated, it came to light that the classes in the schools and the buses were still being segregated. Chapter President E.L. Wilson told the Nansemond School Board of how two Black teachers were teaching all Black classes. Wilson said the board explained “white people had pressed them and they’d fixed it that way so white people would keep their children in school.” Wilson then told of extra school buses being put on so white and Black children would not ride together. He noted one farm on which children of both races live. Separate buses stop at that farm — one for the white children, another for the Black children.Area parents made a plea for free textbooks in the schools. In the late ’60s, students had to pay for textbooks and other supplies provided from the school. There were several grants to assist students who could not afford the books; however, reports showed less than half the students enrolled had purchased the required textbooks.In December 1968, the Health, Welfare and Education department threatened to cut off federal funding to Suffolk Public Schools for what they reported was a failure to fully desegregate the public schools. Suffolk responded that planning was hampered because of a court case in which the city proposed to annex part of Nansemond County. The HWE brief reiterated a plan proposed a year earlier that would cause Suffolk High School to be the only high school in the city, with Booker T.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_2,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°With 10 states enacting universal or near-universal school choice programs since the pandemic, it’s no surprise many are wondering how public schools will be impacted in the future.A chief concern perpetually levied against these programs, which allow families to receive a portion of their child’s per-pupil funding for K-12 education to access schools and other educational services outside the public system, is that they “drain” resources from public schools when students leave.But a look at the data show this criticism defies fiscal sense. In fact, public schools are actually better off when choice policies enter the picture.Choice programs lead to smaller class sizes, better fits between teachers and students, and better matches between students and their learning environment. This translates into more manageable classrooms for teachers and better learning environments for students.Academic research also shows public schools, and outcomes for students who remain in them, improve after choice enters the picture. Research indicates that when choice enters the pictures and expands, students’ overall experience learning improves, absenteeism declines, and suspension rates fall.School funding is also incredibly favorable for public schools because of the funding protections they enjoy.Most states (34 provide protections for districts against funding reductions from declining enrollment. These policies are designed specifically to mitigate funding declines for public schools. The strength of these protections vary considerably, but they ensure one thing: that districts will receive funds for students they don’t serve.To be sure, there are certain advantages to these policies that benefit public schools. These policies offer districts a greater measure of revenue stability and budget predictability, as well as extra time to make budgetary changes when enrollment changes.But these policies also have tradeoffs. They increase costs for taxpayers because the state pays districts for students they no longer enroll. Funding guarantees or “hold harmless” funding, which provide a perpetual source of funding, may unnecessarily direct state funds to districts when their financial circumstances are improving or to districts that have high amounts of local wealth. This arrangement undermines efforts to increase fiscal equity among districts, a supposed goal among many choice opponents.Illinois, which threw more than 9,000 low-income children under the bus by allowing the Invest in Kids Act to sunset and thereby taking their privately funded scholarships away, has a funding protection in place which bases a district’s funding on its current year enrollment or average enrollment from the most recent three years, whichever is greater.Iowa, which enacted education savings accounts, a program that will expand to all K-12 students by 2025-26, includes a funding guarantee to help districts cope with enrollment loss. That is, districts that lose students may receive 101% of funding from the previous year and have one year to adjust.Arguments about choice weakening public schools financially becomes even more tenuous in light of these policies. As policymakers enter a new legislative season and weigh the merits of expanding educational options for their families, they can be even more confident that affected public schools will come through unharmed, and even stronger than before."
eugeneweekly_2023_39,"We ve got issues. “Ican’t believe I’m actually hoping some of the kids on my caseload will land in jail. It’s the only way in our system they’ll ever get the services they need.” We have heard this statement from adults concerned about youth unable to access behavioral health services in this community for more than 20 years. Yet despite many promises from elected officials, people of all ages still cannot access the behavioral health care, including addiction treatment, they need. A “yes” vote on the current jail levy may fund programs for a few incarcerated teens and adults, but it also says yes to a system that does not address root causes and is not an effective community safety policy. This is why we volunteer for Healing Not Handcuffs, a community coalition that opposes the levy. Half the people in Lane County Jail struggle with mental illness and/or substance addiction. In the National Survey on Drug Abuse and Health, Oregon last year had the second highest substance abuse rate in the nation, yet ranked last in access to treatment. Lane County budgeted $36 million for the jail last year, not including court and arrest costs. With 260 beds in use at the time, that meant $11,500 per month just to keep one person in a jail cell. Those funds, if spent wisely in the community, could pay for mental health treatment, addiction recovery programs and youth development projects that would support many individuals toward wellness. Without services in the community, mental health programs in the jail make no sense. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. The fear-based story that the jail is our most valuable resource for ensuring community safety is a myth. Researchers at the Prison Policy Initiative demonstrated that in 13 communities that initiated pretrial release programs, crime rates decreased or held steady once the pretrial release program began. Violent crime did not increase 10 years ago when reduced jail funding resulted in capacity-based releases in Lane County. And, with decriminalization of petty drug crimes under Measure 110, pressure on the jail capacity will continue to drop, while we expect to see the expansion of addiction treatment programs as funding from the program reaches our communities. Decades of research have shown that jails and prisons don’t reduce criminal activity. People are safer in communities where poverty is rare and basic needs are met, yet we fund jails and begrudge funds for affordable housing, adequate health care, education and economic opportunities. We cannot accept the myth of innocents and “thugs,” fueled by politicians manipulating white fears, any longer. As we see hate crimes increasing and gun violence in the news daily, instead of accepting the false promises of punishment, we should reject narratives of fear and retribution and courageously invest in healing and strengthening our communities. Municipalities all over the country are experimenting with restorative justice, which addresses accountability through consequences, not punishment. Consequences could mean loss of power and privilege or paying for medical and recovery costs for someone you harmed. Restorative justice is not “one size fits all.” It puts the needs of the people harmed, and their families, at the center of each process. Restorative justice harks back to Indigenous practices, and is growing in Lane County. The county has an restorative justice program already in place that works in tandem with the Circuit Court. The district attorney determines who can use restorative justice so only a few offenders and victims have access. Conflict Artistry, LLC, is another local site of restorative justice, inviting community members to access their program directly, prior to resorting to police and prosecution. If more community members were willing to attempt a restorative process and let our leaders know, we might experience true accountability and repair from harm. Saying “no” to the levy is only a first step, to admit that the system we have doesn’t make us or our children safer, and, more often than not, harms those caught up in it, as well as their partners and children. We must also invest in the care and services people need outside the jail. To create a community where the largest number of people possible can enjoy health, safety, dignity and belonging, we will have to step up with courage and a willingness to experiment. Compassion and reason point us in the direction of community-based rather than jail-based initiatives.

suffolknewsherald_2023_232,"Published 5:07 pm Friday, July 28, 2023ByStaff ReportsCurrently, America is at a crucial juncture, facing important decisions that will lead us into uncharted territory. We have two options: either embrace green energy policies, leaving behind the outdated energy sources that have brought us this far, or continue using traditional energy while pursuing new initiatives and updating existing systems to make them more sustainable for our ecosystems.It is disheartening that this choice is often dismissed as a conspiracy rather than being accepted as a valid dialogue. The majority of American citizens would like to find common ground on this issue, so what is the problem?The issue lies in the exploitation of climate change concerns by entities such as the United Nations and World Economic Forum, using it as a means to consolidate global industrial power. This practice, known as Green Colonialism, allows these global entities to infringe upon a country’s sovereignty through energy policies and control their economic growth. Without sustainable energy, a country cannot thrive economically.The harsh reality is that Green Colonialism pushes nations into poverty. Uganda’s President Museveni, in an article with the Wall Street Journal, expressed his concerns about what is happening in the region. He stated that “Africans have the right to access reliable, affordable energy, and doing so does not hinder the development of renewable sources on the continent. Forcing Africa down a single path will impede their fight against poverty.”Magatte Wade, a political leader from Senegal and Director of the African Center for Prosperity, also criticized the hypocrisy of European countries. She questioned why Africans are told they can’t use fossil fuels while Europeans still rely on them. She emphasized the need for access to reliable and affordable energy as a central requirement for prosperity.These voices reveal the unfortunate truth behind the climate change narrative and highlight the adverse impact it has on emerging nations. The U.S. should seriously reconsider its foreign policy regarding climate change as it is causing significant problems in these countries.Green Colonialism is no longer hidden; countries are waking up to the manipulation of climate change policies used to control and hinder their economic growth.Americans must distance themselves from this approach as it does not reflect well on the U.S. The controlled media in America has concealed this information from its population, possibly due to some individuals in Washington favoring Europe over their own country or having foreign influences.This is known as Fifth Generation Warfare; for which the United Nations and European oligarchs are strategically battling within the U.S. to influence American statesmen. The consequences of the West’s actions have led Africa to become more involved with the BRICS economic alliance. In fact, South Africa is hosting the BRICS Summit this August, where a significant economic plan for the future will be declared. America needs to recognize the dangers of aligning closely with the United Nations and World Economic Forum’s climate policies, as it appears to be a trap. America should consider relations with BRICS. It would allow us to have closer ties with our neighbors.When it comes to our domestic policy, we should consider one crucial aspect. Before making changes to our infrastructure, we must ensure that the old systems are updated and functioning properly. Otherwise, we risk chaos by leaving the country in the dark during the transition. For example, when building a new house, it is wise not to sell the old one until you move into the new one. Otherwise, you may be left vulnerable without safety, structure, or a plan. However, it seems that the policy oligarchs’ intention may actually be to leave us vulnerable, as it would quickly solve their problems.Drew Varner, a resident of Suffolk, is a researcher and writer.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_123,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°For decades, the National Collegiate Athletic Association fought proposals that would’ve allowed schools to pay athletes. It went to court; it went to Congress. Whenever possible, it extolled the moral and financial benefits of amateurism. Then, last week, the NCAA abruptly changed its mind. Charlie Baker, the association’s president, released a proposal that would enable schools to pay athletes. It’s a profound and radical shift.But it won’t be made for the benefit of athletes. It’s an attempt to keep the association relevant after its long-standing opposition to paying athletes made it anything but. The disconnect between the NCAA and member schools has become so wide that personnel from some of the association’s highest-profile and wealthiest schools have openly mused for years about breaking away and managing their own affairs. If that were to happen — and it could — it would spell the end of the NCAA. Survival and relevance require reform.The NCAA was formed in 1906 to reform the often deadly game of college football. Quick success in overhauling the rules gave the nascent association credibility to expand into rulemaking for other college sports. From the start, those rules embraced amateurism; athletes were expected to play for the joy of the game, not money. The NCAA, however, did not play by the same rules. Over the decades, its power was enhanced by the millions of dollars it earned through its total control of college football television rights.That wealth led to the slow but steady erosion of the NCAA’s standing in American sports. In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA’s control of televised football violated antitrust law. Freed up to sell their own football broadcasts, schools began to generate far more money from televised football than the NCAA could’ve ever provided to them.Schools built stadiums and practice facilities and funded spiraling coaching salaries (coaches at elite football schools averaged $6.2 million in compensation in 2023 . The NCAA’s dogmatic embrace of amateurism meant that they could not pay athletes. Rather than find a comprise that preserves some element of amateurism while ensuring students can profit, too, the organization spent over $300 million on legal expenses between 2015 and 2022 — much of which went to fighting lawsuits that would’ve given athletes the right to profit from their name, image and likeness, or NIL.What a waste. In 2021, the NCAA abruptly backed down in the face of court rulings and state legislation and issued rules allowing student-athletes to profit from their NIL rights. It was a victory for the economic interests of athletes, but the abrupt shift and lack of planning or foresight, after decades of stonewalling, has created chaos.Players are signing bad or even fraudulent deals.Schools are openly using NIL as a recruitment tool despite explicit NCAA rules against doing so. And nobody — not the schools, the coaches or the students — seems overly concerned that they’ll be assisted, punished or ostracized by the increasingly irrelevant and reactive NCAA.In theory, a strong NCAA that had spent the last decade seeking compromise and frameworks for compensating college athletes would be well-positioned to bring order. Instead, it’s busy lobbying Congress for a comprehensive college sports bill to fix what it believes it can’t. Meanwhile, college football’s elite conferences are amplifying long-standing calls for additional autonomy from the NCAA so that they — and not the organization — can set their own rules for amateurism, NIL and other forms of player compensation.A total split would be catastrophic — for the NCAA. If it loses the ability to regulate the most prominent college sport, it would be further diminished as an arbiter of American sports and culture. Meanwhile, the association is facing another front in its battle to remain relevant: multiple lawsuits currently threaten the NCAA’s control over how or if athletes are compensated. Losing any of these will only serve to diminish further the organization in the eyes of its members and the public.Baker’s proposal is an attempt at a course correction. Under it, the NCAA would create a new subdivision among the over 360 Division I schools and allow them to set aside a minimum of $30,000 per year per athlete in a trust fund. Those schools that can afford to join this subdivision (Baker estimates around 100 of the NCAA’s 1,100 members would do it could then set their own rules on NIL, transfers, scholarships and other issues. That’s a long way from the NCAA of the mid-20th century, which collected and distributed televised football revenue and was feared as an enforcer. But it’s probably the best Baker can do.It’s a progressive and proactive approach to a problem mainly of the association’s making. If it were to pass, it would benefit the nation’s elite college football players. But for now, the primary beneficiary is intended to be the NCAA itself. After years of obstructing change, the association is showing that it’s at least willing to compromise. That’s a reform worth applauding. But it won’t return the NCAA to its central place in college sports.Adam Minter is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of sports.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_58,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°This is how far the GOP has fallen: House Republicans on Wednesday unanimously elected as speaker a man who actively tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and would like to lock up people who get an abortion or provide gender-affirming care to minors. It’s not an overstatement to say that Americans, regardless of political affiliation, should be concerned about the future of our democracy.The vote for Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana follows weeks of political turmoil after the removal of his predecessor, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California. Until Wednesday, it seemed as if the Republican conference would be unable to unite on any candidate, given the deep divisions within the party.On Tuesday, the party nominated Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, who is the party’s No. 3 leader in the House. But several right-wing Republicans indicated that they wouldn’t vote for him on the floor, and former President Trump chimed in with a social media post disparaging Emmer as a RINO — “Republican in name only.” Emmer withdrew a few hours later, presumably realizing that the extremists in the party would block him because of his decision to support democracy and certify the 2020 presidential election.In the end, the hard-right MAGA faction won the day with the selection of Johnson, a 51-year-old little-known conservative congressman who gained notoriety for coming up with the legal argument that some members used to vote to block the certification of Biden’s win.If there was any hope that the GOP would steer toward sanity and distance itself from the Trump sideshow, that hope is gone.It’s still unknown where Johnson will lead the party on important issues, though he is a vocal opponent of reproductive rights and gay marriage, and happy to impose his evangelical views on the rest of the country. It’s also unclear if he has the skill to avoid a looming government shutdown. But it’s fair to say that Ukraine aid is now in serious jeopardy. Johnson is among the Republicans who are skeptical of continued financial support for Ukraine as it fights to turn back an invasion by Russia, and voted against two appropriation bills that included funding for the war.Of course Johnson’s elevation to speaker is particularly alarming for the upcoming presidential election, in which a rematch between President Biden and Trump is more than likely. There’s little reason to believe Trump can win legitimately four years after being dumped by a majority of voters, and after being charged in four criminal cases. His best prospect for returning to the White House may be to steal the election, with assistance from MAGA leaders running the House. With Republican election deniers now in charge, that may actually happen. As Rep. Matt Gaetz put it on Stephen K. Bannon’s show: “If you don’t think that moving from Kevin McCarthy to MAGA Mike Johnson shows the ascendance of this movement and where the power in the Republican Party truly lies, then you’re not paying attention.”We hope that voters are paying close attention, particularly those in California. All 12 of the state’s Republican members of Congress lined up in favor of a guy who wanted to throw out the 2020 election results and hand the country over to Trump for four more years.Is this how the experiment in American democracy ends? We hope not. But that depends on whether Americans finally reject the extremists who have taken control of the Republican Party.— Los Angeles TimesHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2023_72,"Published 4:16 pm Tuesday, April 11, 2023ByJen JaquaThe 1950s were ushered in with a worldwide interest in nuclear weapons. As the world’s superpowers raced to develop weapons of their own, the United States set up an aerial guard complete with jet fighters and anti-aircraft weapons to defend the nation’s atomic plants. Several studies and discussions were held about civilian defense and the threat to key locations in the case of nuclear bomb attacks.By mid-June, hostilities in Korea were heated. On June 27, Truman orderedAmerican military forces to aid in the defense of South Korea. Less than 24 hours later,North Korea had taken control of Seoul using Russian tanks. The United States had gone to war again, this time in Korea. The draft was extended. More and more men were sent to Korea.By mid-1950, reserve units were activated. Truman asked for additional military funds, $10 billion to be precise, to supply troops headed to Korea.The front page again gave daily battle reports. Headlines declared massive bombing attacks. Stories provided tallies of downed aircraft and injured or killed soldiers. Reports from the war front were not censored as much as they were during World War II. There were more stories and photos showing and describing in accurate detail the horrors of war.Not all the news from Korea was bad. One short story told about Operation “Kiddy Car,” a military operation led by the chaplain force to transport nearly 1,000 Korean orphans rescued off the streets. The children, aged 6 months to 11 years old, were air-lifted to an island sanctuary off South Korea. Attended by Korean women, they were taken to the child welfare center to be fed and their injuries attended to with the hopes of finding homes at a future time.While war and carnage were the primary headlines, the United States also was making advances in medical care. On April 5, 1950, an aorta transplant was performed at Henry Ford Hospital. The same year, the iron lung was used locally for the first time. The patient was a 15-year-old suffering from a rare muscular disease. The disease had weakened her muscles, particularly those required to breathe. After several life-saving emergency calls, she was admitted to the hospital and put in the iron lung.Nationwide, the number of polio cases hit record highs. Many studies and assumptions were made about the disease, one being that polio was caught through open wounds.With the draft increased and many young men at war in Korea, labor shortages began to affect the nation. A solution found by many companies and factories was to hire more women. As a result of many women working outside the house. Suffolk schools considered the addition of a cafeteria in the local schools to feed lunch to the children. A questionnaire was sent home to all children asking parents’ opinion on the matter.Women were making advances in other areas as well. In June 1951, in Richmond two women were chosen to serve on a jury for the first time.A local watch retailer desired to give a couple graduating students the gift of time and devised a fun way to do so. “A local jewelry store has set up a unique system for determining which boy and girl of the Suffolk High School graduating class this year will receive each of the two watches which it will present. Leonard Barr, manager of Barr Brothers, explained that a large electric clock has been set up in the store window around the face of which have been written the names of the members of the Class of 1951. An eight-day, mechanical clock will be wound up tightly. Wherever the hour and minute hands stop, the names pointed out by the corresponding hands on the electric clock will determine who will receive the watches. The hour hand will point out the boy and the minute hand the girl.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_174,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°(Dreamstime/TNS When my iPhone stopped working earlier this month, I spent an hour trying to fix it before I gave up. I scheduled the earliest-available appointment at an Apple store the next morning and resigned myself to a day without my device.As I drove around to various errands, I awoke to details of the real world that I’d long ago stopped noticing: the faces of strangers in cars behind me at traffic stops, my steering wheel’s leather, the ethereal whiteness of ordinary clouds.Without social media to occupy me at all times, my mind went empty: gloriously empty, with space for nature and new ideas. It was exhilarating. Suddenly, anything seemed possible. Eager to prolong the feeling after I got a new phone, I decided to stay off social media during an upcoming vacation.I’d be seeing friends and going to training events for Brazilian Zouk dancing, my new hobby. My social media addiction includes posting videos of my real-world activities, including dancing, so I knew it would be difficult for me.I often tell myself that my posting is voluntary, with a worthy purpose: to inspire people to exit the Metaverse and bond with others. But the truth is, I’ve raced home from in-person experiences to post about them, pulse racing like a junkie’s. How much of my posting is volitional and how much is compulsory labor for Big Tech, which gives me dopamine hits in exchange?I had to spend time off the apps to find out. Instagram would be the hardest. TikTok had always felt overstimulating to me, and I rarely used Twitter now that Elon Musk had turned it into X, even though I spent years building a following there. Since reducing my Twitter use, I’ve noticed a shift in my thinking: away from binaries. How would a complete social media cleanse change me?The first few days were easy. I arrived at the Brazilian Zouk dance retreat, which took over a wildlife training school in the green slopes near Nevada City. Absorbed in dance classes and meeting new people, I didn’t miss social media at all.In my down time, I re-read Katherine May’s “Enchantment: Awakening Wonder in an Anxious Age,” about the author’s quest to rediscover her childhood sense of awe, which had less to do with beauty than with “a deep engagement with the world around me, the particular quality of attention that accompanies close attention.”I had no memory of finishing the book, which I read earlier this year. But when I reached the final chapters, I saw my own pen markings. It was ironic: I’d read a book about attention while so distracted that I’d forgotten most of the experience.The next morning, eating breakfast with my classmates on a sun-dappled patio, I noticed a large praying mantis on the ground, its body the yellow-green of a ripe lime. Beside me, a friend was posting videos of the previous night of dancing to Instagram. If I weren’t on a digital detox, I realized, I’d be doing the same thing.The insect was crawling toward the dining hall door, where it could be crushed. I knelt down to move it to safety, charmed by its resemblance to foliage and its worshipful pose. I hadn’t seen one in years. I wondered how many small wonders I’d missed while staring at my phone. “How do we worship now?” May asks in her book, “How do we get past the blunt knowing of our disenchanted age and tap back into the magic that we used to perceive everywhere?”The praying mantis offered an answer. Simply noticing was enough. Attention to nuance and in-between spaces could make existence sacred.I sat down again and my friend told me that he’d stayed up all night dancing and seen the sunrise. He pulled up Instagram to show me a video he had posted of the sunrise, ignoring my comments about my social media cleanse. The sky’s pink hues were beautiful, and his desire to share beauty is a good thing.Often for me, though, the impulse to share joy online has come at the expense of presence in the moment. But social media can also open doors to new experiences; it was a friend’s videos of Brazilian Zouk dancing on Instagram that sparked my interest in this activity, which is all about inhabiting our bodies.Later, when a friend texted me a video he’d captured of one of my best dances, I texted it to my abuelita, whose reply was more real than hundreds of Instagram likes: “It looks perfect precious,” she texted in Spanish. “I love watching that Zouk dance.” I didn’t need a large audience — one person was enough.Just as I was marveling at how painless it was to stay off social media, I relapsed. One second, I was responding to a friend’s text. The next moment I was staring at a video of a cute French bulldog. Without realizing it, I’d opened Instagram. I closed it and tried to recall how I ended up there, but I’d done it on autopilot. I resolved to remove the app from my home screen to make it harder to access.The rest of my social media break was easy. I spent time with old friends and their two small sons who lived in a nearby forest, where we gathered mushrooms and floated in a lake. Later, I met friends in San Francisco and joined in more dance sessions.A few times, I felt social media’s pull. But each time, I resisted, remembering the lesson of the praying mantis. Now the challenge is keeping up my resistance in normal life.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
suffolknewsherald_2023_64,"Published 5:14 pm Friday, April 21, 2023ByStaff ReportsHe had been in my home for over a month when he asked if he could bring the empty fish tank in his room at his mom’s house. He wanted to get a new school of fish to enjoy. We discussed the logistics of moving the 45-gallon tank from one place to another and the work that caring for fish entails, but I could tell this was important to him.The tank was grimy from years of neglect, so I mentioned that it might be easier to buy a new tank. He expressed his love for the current tank, so we worked together to clean what we could. We scrubbed every inch of the frame and the glass, getting it as nice as possible.We placed the tank on a table outside as we continued to scrub. Unfortunately, one of the table legs sank into the ground, and the table shifted. The tank slid off the table and shattered into more pieces than anyone could count.We went inside after cleaning the mess of the broken tank. Timothy sat down, and I noticed a few tears rolling from his eyes. Those who don’t know the whole story may find it odd that a 14-year-old would cry over a broken fish tank. After all, it was just a fish tank.But it wasn’t just a fish tank to Timothy. It was a representation of home. It was a symbol of when things were better. It was bringing a little bit of his “normal” into his new reality.There are several steps we can take to help children who have lost an item to which they were attached, and these steps are critical for children who have experienced some sort of trauma in the past.First, we should empathize with their situation and understand that an item may be more important than it appears. Most of us know how an object can have sentimental value, but it’s easy to forget that when we aren’t attached to that item. We may not understand how much an item can mean to a child who has gone through difficult times and does not have much from home and family. An item may have much more value than we realize, and we should not discount that value.Because an item can have great value to children who have gone through difficult times, we must ensure that we aren’t insensitive to their loss of that item. We may be tempted to say things such as, “It was just a fish tank,” or, “We can just get another one.” We may be trying to be helpful with quotes like those but ignoring the fact that the item was important to them belittles their loss.When an item that represents home or a better, more secure portion of a child’s life is broken, we should allow them to mourn that loss in their own way. I couldn’t bring the fish tank back, but I could sit beside him while he contemplated the loss of this reminder of home. It’s okay to let them mourn the loss and to stand by them while they do.Lastly, we can do what we can to help them move forward after losing the important item. I couldn’t fix his fish tank from home, but when the time was right, we purchased a new tank. A 60-gallon tank with various tropical fish now sits in the living room. It’s not the one from his mom’s home, but I hope and pray that it will bring new, good memories from this day forward.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_162,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°It was no surprise that the U.S. Supreme Court turned down Special Counsel Jack Smith’s very unusual request to hear an appeal of a trial judge’s decision that Donald Trump does not enjoy presidential immunity for criminal acts committed during his term of office even before an appeals court ruled on the matter.Smith asked that the Big Nine skip their normal practice and immediately take up D.C. Federal Judge Tanya Chutkan’s Dec. 1 order denying Trump protection from prosecution. While Trump wants Chutkan’s stinging decree overturned (she wrote that the “defendant’s four-year service as commander in chief did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens” and the case will certainly end up before the Supremes, Trump is in no hurry, while Smith is nervously watching the calendar.The March 4 start of Trump’s federal criminal trial for trying to steal the 2020 election is now in doubt while the appeals court accepts briefs in advance of their Jan. 9 oral argument before a three-judge panel.Trump’s lawyers wrote in their papers filed over the weekend that presidents enjoy immunity for their official acts while in office and that continues after they leave office. There’s some logic to that, as we wouldn’t want former presidents brought up on charges by their successors for their time in the Oval Office.But what Trump’s lawyers fail to explain, and what we assume the appeals panel — and, soon enough — the Supreme Court justices, will rule is that Trump is being prosecuted for non-official acts.Nowhere in the statute books of the United States Code or 234 years of precedent under the present Constitution does stealing an election fall under official acts.Trump also argues that since he was impeached for the same actions (the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by the House and acquitted by the Senate, a criminal trial now would be double jeopardy.But it was exactly the opposite logic that some senators used to vote against conviction, that as a private citizen post-Jan. 20, he could face justice.And Jack Smith is seeking justice.We generally agree that a sitting president can’t be indicted. Say a president commits a crime while in office, like shooting dead a White House tourist with a Secret Service agent’s weapon. The recourse would be to quickly impeach and remove that president and then have the ex-president be indicted and tried for the murder.Trump had immunity from just about everything while he was in office, but once he left office, either through impeachment and removal or the end of his four-year term, he’s just a regular Donald, as liable to prosecution as anyone else who committed a felony.The appeals judges will also have to dispense with Trump’s claim that he was engaged in his official duties, like signing or vetoing legislation or submitting nominations or issuing executive orders or otherwise carrying out the legal obligations and responsibilities of the highest office in the land.Calling up Georgia’s secretary of state to have him find 11,780 more votes and pressuring Michigan election officials to not certify results and summoning a mob are not in any way official acts. Those are crimes, for which Trump must pay.— New York Daily NewsNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_19,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that aims to undo a federal prohibition on people with domestic violence restraining orders from owning firearms on the argument that even these individuals have an unabridged constitutional right to deadly weapons.It’s a farcical line of reasoning that’s only being given a serious hearing because of the court’s already irresponsible jurisprudence on guns, which has thrown open the door to challenges like this one and an upcoming case on the use of bump stocks, which make some semi-automatic weapons fire automatically. Fortunately, it seems like Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar is coaxing the justices towards the right ruling, if only by convincing them that the limitation fits into the court’s reckless and ahistorical guidelines for appropriate firearm restrictions.Even if Prelogar’s herculean efforts manage to shoehorn the domestic abuser ban into the court’s new standard for gun restrictions to fit within its hazy and subjective understanding of the “history and tradition” associated with the 1789 Second Amendment, this is a ridiculous standard.It goes beyond even the reasonable tenet that restrictions should take into account social and legal precedent and engage with the meaning of law as it was enacted, instead practically forcing the government to conform to the specific understanding of small-arms regulation from an era when flintlock muskets were cutting edge — and before the contemporary concept of domestic violence functionally existed.There’s a reason we don’t expect modern health regulations to ascribe to our conception of the “history and tradition” of medical regulations. Health care is both infinitely more complicated and better understood than it was 200 years ago, just as firearms are far more advanced and numerous, their need negated by sizable police departments and one of the world’s largest standing armies and the grave consequences of their proliferation more acutely apparent.This notion that proactive limitation of access to practically the only commercially available tools designed specifically to kill is inherently a constitutional violation is actually a recent narrative that flies in the face of more than a century of legislation. That legacy included the very New York law that the Supreme Court eviscerated last year in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, setting off this anti-regulation frenzy, ironically counter to the “history and tradition” standard the court itself created.If that seems bizarre, the explanation is simple: the court’s conservative majority has been keen on tailoring the law to their ideological ends. Perhaps, in the time between Bruen and now, the additional drumbeat of additional stories about people around the country losing their lives to preventable gun violence and the frequent shock of mass shootings has pushed the justices to reconsider their position.Many of the court’s decisions are very consequential, of course, but in this case opening the floodgates further would quickly, directly and proportionally lead to more deaths; that’s not an opinion, it’s an indisputable fact. The damage they’ve done is already done, but the justices must now staunch the bleeding.— New York Daily News"
suffolknewsherald_2023_33,"Published 5:26 pm Tuesday, May 30, 2023ByJen JaquaThe mid-1960s news belonged to the schools.In January 1963, Florence Bowser School was dedicated. It was one of several new schools built or renovated.In July 1963, Nansemond County enacted school attendance rules. Early in the administration of Gov. J. Lindsay Almond, the General Assembly, as part of what came to be known as Massive Resistance to the school desegregation program, amended the state code to abolish compulsory attendance. Both Nansemond County and Suffolk had been without compulsory attendance laws since then. A new Suffolk attendance law took effect Sept. 6.Later in the same year, Nansemond School Board raised teacher salaries. “The prospective increase will raise minimum salaries for degree-holding teachers from $3,900 to $4,000 a year. Maximum salaries for teachers with bachelor’s degrees will jump from $4,900 to $5,000.”On June 17, 1964, the first three Black students were assigned to white schools in Suffolk. School started “uneventfully” Sept. 2. “Suffolk City schools were quietly integrated Wednesday for the first time as school opened. There were no incidents reported and none expected. Activity at all schools was normal. Two Black students entered the sixth grade at Jefferson and one the third grade at Randolph. William R. Savage Jr., superintendent of city schools, said today was the most successful opening day ever experienced, that pre-school planning had paid good dividends for everyone involved in the opening.”Other areas of the city and country did not integrate so “quietly.” Civil Rights marches took place all accross the south. About 185 people from the Suffolk area attended the historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on Aug 28, 1963. “At 9:45 a.m., by police estimate there were 25,000 demonstrators on hand. The gathering was obviously slow-paced by comparison with the advance estimates that 100,000 — maybe as many as 250,000 — would take part in the mile-long noontime march from the monument to the Lincoln Memorial. At 9 a.m., 11 special trains had pulled in, carrying 5,300 demonstrators. On the monument grounds, there was a carnival atmosphere. The whole area was heavily policed. Along a major part of Constitution Avenue, officers stood shoulder to shoulder. There were civil police and military police. Also available, if needed, were several thousand troops at military posts in the Washington area.”In September 1963, Suffolk City Council adopted a resolution for Mayor Major T. Benton to appoint a bi-racial commission, a group of seven people with the purpose of seeking solutions to problems presented to the committee and “to bring together people from each race representative of the different areas of interest in the city.”However in May 1964, protests took place throughout the city. At Planters Peanuts, over discrimination in pay, “pickets at Planters lay across Norfolk and Western spur lines leading into the Standard Brands distribution center in an effort to stop the removal of six box cars from the center. Large crowds of Blacks jammed East Washington Street early last night, and police were flooded by complaints from motorists of broken windshields and windows, rocks, bricks and occasional garbage cans were thrown at the automobiles of motorists through the area, and windows at buses were reported broken by rocks and bricks thrown by the crowd.”Likewise a three-day boycott of Suffolk buses took place, “Stoning of buses and breaking of bus windows” as well as multiple incidents were reported of potential riders being threatened at bus stops, but no injuries or arrests were reported.Downtown businesses were not immune to the changes happening. “A selective buying program, boycotting businesses where no efforts had been made to practice or encourage fair employment policies,” was planned and coordinated.As tensions rose nationwide, the question of military involvement was addressed. “U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara did not specifically forbid members of the armed forces from demonstration in civilian clothes while off duty, but he did say none may demonstrate when the activities constitute a breach of law and order, or when violence is reasonably likely to result.”As social change swept the nation, advances in technology, medicine and space discovery progressed almost as rapidly.On April 15, 1964, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel opened. The $200 million, 17.6-mile long bridge-tunnel linked Virginia’s mainland and the Eastern Shore for the first time in history. The American Society of Civil Engineers designated the new crossing one of the “seven engineering wonders of the world.”On the space frontier, weather satellites are launched into orbit. Tiros 7 transmitted photos of clouds taken from space. The weather satellites were launched in hopes of expanding hurricane and typhoon forecasting.Several months later, with the objective of a moon landing, Ranger 7 photographed the moon before crashing into it, giving the world the first close up images of the moon’s surface taken from orbit.Medical research had turned the battle to cancer. Further developments were made in understanding the structures of the basic core of all viruses — specifically the nucleic acids DNA and RNA. These discoveries were “probably more significant, if less appreciated by the public, than the unlocking of atomic energy.”In Suffolk, businesses and buildings were going up along Main Street. In August 1963, the new Woolworths opened in Suffolk, located on the site of the old City Market on North Main Street. The new building more than doubled the size of the former Woolworths store on West Washington. Several public parking lots were also constructed. Legmans built a new store on Main Street where the Palace Theater had been, and Seaboard Bank began building its modernized bank.To help citizens find everything and everybody they were looking for, a new city directory was under way in 1964. A house-to-house canvass was made by the enumeration team, and at all homes where they received no response, they left a slip containing the information needed for the individuals to complete.Some issues read the same in the mid ’60s as they do to this day. “The blocked-crossings have long been a problem in Suffolk. Interest in finding a solution was heightened when a disabled Norfolk and Western Railway coal jack blocked many of the town’s crossings for a considerable period of time.”The Nation gasped on Nov. 22, 1963, when President John F.

leoweekly_2023_29,"Musicis a thread. It knits us together in fellowship, ties our emotions back together when they fracture and punctuates many of life’s great moments and deepest tragedies. It’s a language that we all speak.When I started at LEO, many moons ago as a freelancer,I was asked to write about music. The editor knew that I’d hosted a music festival and maybe knew that I had some writing acumen? Who knows but he found me and asked if I’d be interested in writing for LEO about music.When I got the call from him, I’d just lost a job — a situation that gave me severe stress reactions. It was one of the moments where a white woman had weaponized her tears against me and I made the mistake of fighting back. To be fair, what I was fighting for was a job that I didn’t need and that was making me very unhealthy. So losing that job was the absolute best thing that could have happened. Hindsight, of course and I feel like we’ve had this chat before.The window that opened with LEO in that dark after-period, would shift my life completely and it started with music.When I was invited to the pages of the paper, I knew that I didn’t want to write about bands in a traditional way nor did I want to do reviews. I thought hard about what I wanted to say about music and decided that I would write about music in a way that illuminated how we lived with it.How music saves us and how we make our way in the world accompanied by a soundtrack, mostly of our choosing.My first column, “Me vs. Music: Lift Me Like An Olive Branch,” offered a bit of background about why I decided to approach writing about music in that way. What that did was to allow me the space to use music to laugh, to cry — to release years of trauma at the readers’ expense. Thanks y’all.Anyway, as you read this new issue, I want you to think about how you live with music. How does it serve you and how to do you use it when you want to feel better, to process life, or to just complete basic daily tasks like cleaning (see: Me vs. Music: Clean Cole .Music is a visceral experience, even when we aren’t actively choosing music, we’re probably tapping, or humming or finding rhythm in something around us. We’re just built that way.As I’m wrapping this up, I remembered one of the first songs that made me cry — if you laugh, we’re not friends anymore. But, if you’ve never heard “Wildfire” by Michael Martin Murphey, then give yourself a treat and listen to this terribly sad story of a girl and her horse based on a ghost story Murphey’s granddad told him. I was a sucker for drama at a very young age and well on my way to being the adult spooky muffin that I am today.If you get the urge for something funny, sometimes thoughtful or just plain, ‘wtf,’ go back and check out when I was a newbie LEO writer trying to figure out why music was just so important.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_135,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Afghan refugees eat lunch at a registration centre on their arrival from Pakistan at the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in Spin Boldak district of Kandahar province on Dec. 3, 2023. More than 345,000 Afghans have returned to their country or been deported since Pakistan in October ordered undocumented migrants or those who have overstayed their visas to leave. (Sanaullah Seiam/AFP via Getty Images/TNS Amid wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, Western governments have limited capacity to deal with another humanitarian crisis. Yet a decision by Pakistan to expel hundreds of thousands of Afghans threatens to create a new wave of refugees and destabilize an already volatile region. Preventing the chaos from spreading needs to be a priority.In October, Pakistan’s caretaker government announced that all foreigners residing in the country without legal documents would have to leave by Nov. 1. Pakistan hosts more than 3 million refugees and migrants from neighboring Afghanistan, including roughly 600,000 who fled after the Taliban regained power in August 2021. About 1.7 million of them were believed to lack proper papers when the expulsion order was issued. Since then, more than 400,000 have crossed into Afghanistan.Pakistan says its decree doesn’t target Afghans specifically. But some officials have linked the policy to a recent upsurge in attacks by militants, including Afghans, affiliated with a terrorist group called Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP. Pakistani officials accuse Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers of providing the TTP’s commanders with havens from which to mount attacks against Pakistan. After trying various means to pressure the Kabul regime, Pakistan now appears to be exploiting the migrants as leverage.The vast majority of Afghans being expelled have nothing to do with the TTP. Many have lived in Pakistan for years and are returning to a country they barely know. Others worked with NATO forces and are waiting in Pakistan for their visas to the US or other countries to be processed. According to Human Rights Watch, some have been beaten, threatened with sexual assault or had their homes bulldozed.In addition to the humanitarian toll, the exodus poses potential security risks. Afghanistan is already facing a dire economic crisis, with two-thirds of the population dependent on outside assistance. Refugees who can’t provide for their families may well attempt to migrate again, perhaps to Turkey and onward to Europe, exacerbating the West’s migration challenges. More likely, they’ll sink deeper into poverty and despair, fueling radicalization and providing terrorist groups such as the TTP, Islamic State and al-Qaeda with new recruits.For those reasons, the outside world can’t afford to look away. President Joe Biden’s administration should pressure Pakistan either to reverse its policy or at least delay its implementation until after the harsh winter months, giving both migrants and Afghan officials more time to prepare.The U.S. and others also need to live up to their own obligations to Afghans who’ve fled in fear of the Taliban. They should speed up the processing of Afghan asylum claims, provide those who’ve already immigrated a pathway to permanent residence, and meet the UN’s aid appeal for regional countries hosting Afghan refugees, which is less than 30% funded. Afghanistan itself desperately needs more aid, although the regime’s abhorrent treatment of women and girls makes further donations unpalatable to Western publics. In return for Pakistan’s agreement to halt expulsions, the U.S. should share intelligence to help the government locate TTP leaders. Pakistan has a right to address legitimate security concerns. What it should not do is force innocent Afghans, who have seen too much suffering already, to pay the price.— Bloomberg OpinionNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.During the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI."
suffolknewsherald_2023_224,"Published 10:55 am Sunday, August 13, 2023ByStaff ReportsThe Rev. Jason StumpOakland Christian United Church of ChristIn Matthew 22:37-39, it is written, “He said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”There’s much that can be unpacked about these two verses.The “love the Lord” part is clearly important; there’s no doubt about that. However, that doesn’t seem to be the thing many Christians struggle with, especially the most devout among us. Also, though many think differently, it is not the thing non-Christians are struggling with Christians over.For now, I want to talk about the “love your neighbor” part. It really is quite simple, don’t you think? It’s something many Christians have a hard time with, even the most devout. It’s a common criticism of Christians- again, often directed at those claiming to be the most devout.Jesus gives us only two commandments. To love our neighbor is one of them. It is very closely intertwined with the other commandment. In order to love our God, who is Creator of all things, we must love our neighbors. Do you? Not just the ones next door, but even the ones in our thoughts. I would like you to consider the idea that, in spiritual matters, if someone enters our thoughts, then they have become our spiritual neighbor. That they are occupying our very thoughts seems to be pretty proximal, agreed? Myself, I sometimes miss that mark of loving all those I think about. How about you?Ever since attending the Chuckatuck site for Suffolk’s National Night Out, I’ve had something one of my neighbors said stuck in my head.Roosevelt Jones is a lifelong resident of the Chuckatuck Borough. He’s a pillar of the community- loved, respected and admired by all. He loves his neighbors and lets you know it.While Roosevelt was introducing folks to each other, specifically making connections between new clergy like me, I heard him tell someone, “Chuckatuck is a great community. I plan to keep it that way as long as I live.”Now, I know Roosevelt well enough to know that he was saying this out of authentic love of his neighbors and pride in his community. I also know him well enough to know that he was offering advice, and instruction. He’s right to do so. Roosevelt knows the lessons of life and the commandments of Christ. He’s also spot on when he says, “Chuckatuck is a great community…”Wherever you live in Suffolk, from Burbage Grant to Whaleyville, I hope you have leaders who love your neighborhoods like Roosevelt Jones does. I hope you have a heart that loves your neighbors- those in your borough and those on your mind. It’s a commandment of Christ. It’s also a basic requirement for societies to progress in peace and productivity.May we all be better neighbors, Christ followers or not.The Rev.

I want to do a childcare and early-year developmental course, but I’m unsure if I’ll be able to get onto the course and complete the course while I’m struggling with my anorexia and depression. What do you think?—Looking AheadCards: Knight of Pentacles, High Priestess (rev. , Nine of Cups, Eight of Cups.Dear Looking,Very recently, someone wrote in and discussed dealing with their eating disorder. In that response, I highly encouraged the letter-writer to seek out an eating disorder specialist and would encourage you to do the same. Anorexia is a very complex disease (as is depression, which often co-exists with eating disorders that requires specialized care. If you already have someone, that’s great, but if not, I strongly encourage that to be priority number 1.Having a solid team that you can rely on will help you as you work towards your career goals—which I do believe you’ll be able to reach.Mental illness can feel like chaos, which the horse in the Knight of Pentacles represents. But the Knight is in control; he can see his destiny on the horizon, and, most importantly, he can guide the horse. I think this applies to both your career goals and your mental health recovery. As long as you’re feeling in control (and have help when you feel out of control , you can absolutely do this.The High Priestess reversed paired with the Nine of Cups are two cards that suggest deep psychological work and soul searching. The High Priestess is often a card of the unconscious, as well as secret knowledge. She is the guardian of our spirit, and to work with her is to truly meet ourselves deep down. The Nine of Cups tells us not to be distracted by fantasy and to really know who we are and what we want.If you genuinely want to go into a career in childcare, you will get there. You’re the Knight in control. But that path might not look as straightforward in practice as it does in theory. With the Eight of Cups, it’s important to be adaptable. You’re already showing a lot of bravery by taking this new path, but it might zig and zag in ways you can’t foresee.If you enroll in your courses but find that you need to take a semester off to treat your mental health, that’s ok. Just because you’re pausing on the road doesn’t mean you’ve abandoned the journey. You are on this path for you. Artificial deadlines don’t matter. Doing things “the normal way” is horseshit. You’re doing what you need to do to reach your destination, so please show yourself some grace. It’s hard to be human, and all of us need help from others now and again.You are here to take care of yourself and, in turn, care for others. You will absolutely get there. It may not be as fast as you imagine, but your illness will not stop you. The worst it can do is slow you down temporarily. But, again, this isn’t a race. It’s a journey.I hope you get there with your health and your hard-earned degree.Take care, my darling.Dear Oracle,I’ve been a sommelier for five years now and have worked for a wine distributor for the past year. While I’ve worked in some phenomenal restaurants and made great connections, I’m ready to leave the South to advance my career. I have contacts in California and Italy and have been considering moving to either place. Any thoughts on which place is best for me?—Wandering WinoCards for California: Five of Wands, Nine of Wands, Knight of Cups (rev. Cards for Italy: Hierophant, The Lovers, Ten of Wands (rev. Dear WW,If you can swing it, go to Italy. I know that option is the more expensive one, and would require all the paperwork of visas and passports and would probably require you to learn (or improve another language and flee your home country, but it’s got the best cards by far.California may be a struggle. I don’t know much about the wine world, but I do know about working in fine dining restaurants (the natural habitat of sommeliers , and some can be incredibly toxic. The Five of Wands is a lot of conflict, and with the burnout-central Nine of Wands, it feels like you might be facing uphill battles. The Knight of Cups reverse also suggests that your love for wine and your passion might be exploited—which, unfortunately, is also common in the restaurant world. It doesn’t seem like the healthiest vine for you to grow.Italy, on the other hand? My god. You have the Hierophant, the giver of knowledge and vocations, where you’ll learn everything you need to know. You have The Lovers, the ultimate expression of love and passion for what you do. Then you have the Ten of Cups reversed, the marriage of your passions and knowledge, the culmination of your journey to get here. (Alternatively, The Lovers and Ten of Cups could mean a literal lover and marriage, so fingers-crossed you also meet your future spouse and live out your days in a villa in Tuscany. Even if Italy is a temporary move and you only stay a year or so, all of that major arcana energy could really ignite something inside of you. Italy has a wine culture that is thousands of years old, and while Napa is nice, it just doesn’t have that kind of history. Think about what you could learn from a 900-year-old vineyard!Again, I know that an international shuffle is not an easy option, and certain things need to line up both bureaucratically and financially, but if it’s in the realm of possibility, I say go for it.Buona fortuna, bella.Subscribe to LEO Daily newsletters.|NewsBreak (coming soon |||||*** ."

I have seen the many hours my mom and her fellow teachers have put in for nothing in return.The current system is destined to fail; it’s failing teachers now. The school, the state Department of Education and administration have absolutely no safety net or compensation for teachers. And I would go so far to say that they don’t ever plan on changing.At my alma mater a few years back, there was an incident involving a teacher and a student. The teacher was allegedly being cyberbullied by one of her students. The student apparently sent numerous emails threatening and bombarding the teacher.This teacher was old, kind and in her last year of teaching when this incident happened. It had been going on for a few months, but I found out from some friends who heard it through the grape vine that is high school gossip.The admin investigated and found that the rumor was true. However, instead of addressing the situation to the whole school, they kept it between them, the teacher and the student.The bullying supposedly stopped after that, and the student got suspended. The teacher unfortunately passed away a few months later.Teachers are mistreated and constantly neglected over and over again. Not only as a future teacher or a teacher’s daughter, but as a human being, I say enough is enough. I hope that things will change, but sometimes hope isn’t enough.I know that the higher-ups, like the admin, want to keep situations like this a secret. How can it be a secret when teachers are going through this abuse every day?I encourage people and aim to spread awareness to the people of this community. See something, say something. Because if we don’t, who will?Maya PolloiHiloPeninsula a greatplace for seniors?Waiakea Peninsula should be converted to housing for the elderly so our seniors can enjoy walking, swimming, easy golf and eventually being rolled around the fine park and gardens of the area.Most of the limited parking can serve the staff who offer care services, and the old restaurants can become their kitchens, etc.Also, the folks who previously were in control of 121 Banyan Drive should be made responsible for the condition of the building and for all of the extensive utility bills they racked up before abandoning the property.

Emily Brewer, for a new state Senate seat serving Western Tidewater might be the most significant development yet in a race full of twists, turns and intrigue.As we’ve written before, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Senate District 17, which includes all of Suffolk, just might determine which party controls the state Senate and, in turn, the General Assembly come 2024.Youngkin, for obvious reasons, wants Republican majorities in the legislature so that he has no obstacles to enactment of his conservative agenda for Virginia. While he waited longer than we thought he would to pick a horse in the Republican primary, he’s now made it clear that he thinks Brewer is not only the right person to represent this region in Richmond but also the most likely to defeat state Del. Clinton Jenkins, who is unopposed for the Democratic nomination.An endorsement by the popular Youngkin strikes us as mostly positive for Brewer, but challenger Hermie Sadler, the Emporia businessman and former NASCAR driver, understands, and is taking advantage of, the presumed front-runner’s vulnerability.Sadler quickly declared Youngkin’s endorsement to be a classic example of the Republican establishment protecting its own. The message resonates with many Republicans in the wake of a bruising battle over whether the party would choose its Senate District 17 nominee in a primary or at a convention. A lawsuit that ultimately caused a judge to order a primary alleged improper influence by Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares in pushing for a convention, where Brewer would almost certainly have prevailed.The squabble over nomination method set the tone for a race that has become outright nasty with several weeks still left until the election. Most Republicans we hear from just want it to be over.If you think the GOP primary is brutal, just wait until the general election in the fall. Money from interest groups all over the country will fund every manner of negative ad on both sides as Democrats and Republicans understand just how important the Virginia General Assembly is.Republican control of both chambers of the legislature would further confirm what Youngkin’s 2021 upset victory suggested: that Virginia isn’t a reliably blue state after all.

Let’s put this into context to see if dark forces are at work or if this is a nothing burger with a side of kalo fries.“Intelligence diplomacy” blurs the line between intel officers and State Department foreign service officers (diplomats . No question. This is nothing new, though. U.S. special envoy for the Six Party Talks with North Korea (2003-2006 Joe Detrani was a career CIA operator (as a division chief, he signed the papers transforming me from analyst to ops officer . Our ambassadors to Iran, Germany and the U.N. have included former CIA Directors William Colby and Richard Helms (also an officer of the OSS, CIA’s predecessor and deputy CIA director and Military Intelligence Hall of Fame inductee Gen. Vernon Walters.The president’s selective use of spy chiefs — cloaks pinned back, daggers sheathed — as diplomatic envoys can be effective in advancing foreign policy, especially with countries where security services are power-and-authority symbols. In such countries, CIA station chiefs’ access to foreign leaders can surpass that of our local ambassador. (A senior royal family member cooked and served pancakes to one of my chiefs during a private-residence breakfast … not something the local ambo ever enjoyed. Even as a junior officer, I used my CIA affiliation to more easily secure meetings with senior foreign security personnel and political oppositionists than could higher ranking U.S. diplomats, much to their chagrin. Let’s not forget, too, that Burns is actually a career diplomat, previously serving as ambassador to Russia and Jordan. He’s a political appointee to CIA, not a career intel officer.This type of reallocation of talent across agencies has long existed in our government. Former President Donald Trump moved CIA Director Mike Pompeo over to run the State Department. George Bush Sr. was CIA director before moving to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.CIA Director Leon Panetta (who I personally briefed went on to be defense secretary. Recently departed State Department spokesman Ned Price — frequently on TV — was previously a CIA analyst (we worked together at Langley during the Obama administration . 2024 GOP presidential candidate Will Hurd, who withdrew his bid in October, was an agency ops officer for a decade before becoming a Texas congressman.(No, this incestuousness is not “deep state.” Using highly capable people with very solid government experience in different roles reflects sound leadership; it advantages our nation. The U.S. is not alone in this practice. In August, the heads of Australia’s Office of National Intelligence and Secret Intelligence Service met with Timore-Leste’s prime minister in Dili. In mid-July, Israel quietly dispatched the Mossad director to Washington for talks with the White House to discuss normalizing Saudi-Israeli ties. (Unidentified CIA personnel reportedly were present, but the main U.S. interlocutors were nonintel types. In the past few years, former Mossad chief Yossi Cohen has acted as Tel Aviv’s special envoy to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.It’s not always a positive thing. In June, Turkey’s President Erdogan appointed to the position of foreign minister (think “secretary of state” National Intelligence Organization head Hakan Fidan — notorious for kidnapping from abroad political critics of Erdogan. Most analysts view this appointment as an authoritarian’s use of clandestine levers of power to sustain his rule, not the leveraging of a savvy spy master to more effectively advance international relations.“What about Burns’ Cabinet appointment?” First, it bolsters his standing when he is dispatched by the White House to represent our nation on any issue. Second, there is precedence. Trump’s cabinet included CIA Directors Pompeo and Gina Haspell — the first female director, who offered me a plum assignment to delay my plans to pursue a simpler life in Hawaii (I said “no”…a story for another day .

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_18,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°We have learned so much about new House Speaker Mike Johnson since he was elected to the post last month.For starters, that he exists.Inevitably, this uber-conservative MAGA Republican from Louisiana has found himself subject to the laser-level scrutiny befitting a once-obscure backbencher who suddenly becomes second in line to the presidency.Johnson, we know, is virulently opposed to gay marriage and abortion. He is an election denier and religious extremist who has promoted teaching the Bible as history in public schools and has said, “God invented civil government.”That is to be expected, I suppose, from a man whose party, under the sway of former President Donald Trump, become nearly indistinguishable from a cult.Turns out, there’s also a lot about Johnson that is kind of weird.He does not report having checking accounts, savings accounts or retirement accounts.He has either four or five children, depending on how you count.He has blamed the fall of the Roman Empire on “rampant homosexuality” and has supported criminalizing gay sex.And — perhaps most strangely — he and his teenage son monitor each other’s every keystroke in an effort to make sure they don’t expose themselves to pornography.This was recently revealed in a clip that was posted by the user Receipt Maven on X. Last year, Johnson spoke on a panel during a “War on Technology” conference sponsored by a Baptist church in Benton, La. In it, Johnson enthusiastically endorsed a surveillance app called Covenant Eyes. The app, which is promoted by churches and other conservative religious groups such as Promise Keepers, has users designate “accountability partners” to hold them to task in the event they stray into illicit digital outer space. Often the accountability partner is a pastor or fellow church member.Covenant Eyes, which costs about $15 a month, takes one screenshot per minute, Wired reported last year in a story about what it called “anti-porn shameware,” which is a multimillion-dollar industry.Johnson’s accountability partner, he said, was his teenage son Jack. Once a week, he said, he and Jack receive a report of what the other has been doing on his phone, laptop or tablet.“If anything objectionable comes up, your accountability partner gets an immediate notice,” Johnson said. “It looks for keywords, search terms and also images. It’s really sensitive.” Johnson said he once got an alarm about Jack’s questionable internet usage involving a blurry image of two women. “I had to zoom in on it and unblur it,” Johnson said, “and it’s two middle-aged teachers.”Not doing anything porn-y, I presume.David J. Ley, an Albuquerque-based clinical psychologist and sexuality expert, told me he doesn’t think accountability apps are inherently bad. “I do think that it’s healthy for people to spend some time thinking about what role they want sexuality and pornography to play in their lives,” said Ley, author of “The Myth of Sex Addiction.”However, he added, “if the speaker was sitting on my therapy couch, this is not a strategy that I would recommend. It doesn’t seem likely to support healthy boundaries between him and his son, or to help his son develop a responsible view of sexuality. We don’t develop healthy sexuality by trying to control and suppress negative urges.”I guess when it comes to porn, I am in the “whatever floats your boat” camp.I think porn is kind of gross, but I don’t object on religious grounds, think it causes erectile dysfunction or that it messes with your brain wiring, as some anti-porn crusaders contend.(What it can do is give impressionable users unrealistic ideas about sexual performance, which is a lot more complicated than porn makes it seem. As Ley joked, “The internet is conducive to sex. You don’t have to find its clitoris or buy it dinner.” There is a wealth of research disputing the very concept of pornography addiction. Some studies even show that, as one put it, “religiosity and moral disapproval of pornography use were robust predictors of perceived addiction to Internet pornography while being unrelated to actual levels of use among pornography consumers.”In other words, you might consume pornography as much or as little as the next person, but if you exist in an environment that considers it dirty or immoral, you will be more likely to perceive yourself as a porn addict.When I spend any time thinking about porn, it’s usually in the context of gender and politics: Does it exploit women or empower them? Or both?But that is not what accountability apps like Covenant Eyes are about. At all.“In my experience,” Ley told me, “accountability partners are using this software to monitor not just looking at explicit or illicit material, but to regulate or monitor anything other than heteronormative monogamy. We are inviting external morality police to monitor our sexual thoughts, impulses and desires.” (Not to mention masturbation, which may be the ultimate target here. In any case, Ley said, there is no clinical evidence that apps designed to bring shame or embarrassment actually have their intended effects.“Very often, we find that men are using pornography to cope with anxiety, stress and depression,” he said. “What that means is we need to help this guy develop other strategies and coping skills to deal with those feelings.”I tried to reach the founder of Covenant Eyes but was rebuffed by a company spokesman. “Here is our statement,” he wrote. “Porn harms people. We help anyone who commits to staying clear of it.”One way to reduce the allure of pornography is almost never addressed by folks who promote apps like Covenant Eyes: sex education, a bugaboo of the religious right.“We are engaging in gross national neglect of the sexual education needs of our young people,” said Ley. “We pretend that if we don’t talk about it, it won’t happen, and when bad things happen, they blame pornography, which kids go to because we don’t teach them about sex. It is this horrendous spiral of sexual self-sabotage.”Speaker Johnson and his son have every right to pursue “accountability” in whatever way they see fit.But I think they are deluding themselves for two reasons: Porn is not, in and of itself, a problem. And anyone who really wants to see prurient material will always find a way to get it."

Lots of folks recognize the day by picking up some litter, planting a tree or some flowers or loading up items to take for recycling.The efforts of local residents in Suffolk focused on Earth Day have garnered the attention of the Keep Virginia Beautiful Program.Saturday’s Suffolk Earth and Arts Festival and the new LOVE sign created by welding students at the College and Career Academy at Pruden are two great ways our community is recognizing the importance of what we have in the city. They both got recognition on the organization’s website.We believe KVB is right in an article published a few years back that Earth Day is something that shouldn’t be limited to a day or a week, it can be something we all tend to everyday.We in Suffolk have so much to celebrate with our beautiful outdoor venues, the city’s regional and neighborhood parks, our waterways and the Great Dismal Swamp, to name a few. They offer us an abundance of ways to get out and enjoy the outdoors with trails, picnics, fishing and boating, or just taking a relaxing nap under the shade of a tree.Protecting the beauty of our community, our region and Mother Earth can be as easy as undertaking some simple things, as KVB points out.Take those plastic grocery bags, as an example. A simple change to reusable bags can eliminate up to 120 shopping bags in a year for each family, Keep Virginia Beautiful estimates with the help of the folks at Food Lion. Imagine the difference this would make with thousands of us moving to reusable ones and eliminating them from the wastestream.The Farmer’s Almanac had some great ideas in a story on its website, almanac.com, with ways we can do things that will improve our environment and make a difference.The Almanac’s suggestions include:By adopting even a few of these ideas, it can become fun as all of the family and the children join in to celebrate Earth Day year round.

leoweekly_2023_69,"Dear Oracle,I’ve been married for nearly a decade to my husband. I love him so much, and he’s my best friend. However, he’s not very “romantic.” I don’t get a lot of words of affirmation or quality time with him, two things that are important to me and my love language. (We have talked about it, and he gets defensive and thinks I’m criticizing him. Recently, an old ex has been texting me, saying he regrets not fighting for me, thinks I’m beautiful, worships me, etc. It’s very over the top but also kind of thrilling! I don’t want to leave my husband… but I do really like this new attention. I’ve been texting back, and I’m not sure where I want this to go. Do the cards have any advice?-Flirting With The PastCards: Knight of Wands, Page of Pentacles (rev. Temperance, StrengthDear Flirting,It’s not surprising that you’re thrilled that your ex is telling you he regrets losing such a beautiful, heavenly creature. That’s some dramatic validation that you still got it—and I don’t think many people are immune to that kind of flattery, happily married or not.However, opening the door to flirting with an ex can lead to many paths with a range of consequences. You might just send some slightly flirty texts for a couple of weeks, and then it peters out to nothing. You might start with texts but then go to phone calls, dates, and then onward to a full-blown affair. You really get to decide how much you want to escalate things.Because it wouldn’t surprise me if your ex wants an affair. His card is the Knight of Wands: passionate, impulsive, with a streak of wildness. Of course this type of person would text a married ex some fiery, dramatic declarations. He’d whisk you away, probably on the back of a motorcycle, from your dull domestic life to live deliciously—or so he’ll promise.This level of big “R” Romantic energy can be intoxicating—which makes it hard for your less passionate husband to compete.Your husband is the Page of Pentacles reversed. He’s a hard worker, no doubt, and while he may appreciate beauty, he doesn’t know how to express it. Like all Pentacles, he might show love through more “practical” ways: financially, doing chores, things like that.It’s worth noting that your husband is a Page, not a King. Pages can be a bit on the immature or emotionally underdeveloped side. So that would make sense as to why when you say, “I’d like you to say more lovey-dovey things to me,” he hears, “you’re an unromantic piece of shit.”It also suggests that, at this moment, the Knight is taking up more of your mental energy. This ex is looming large, and your husband is dwarfed by comparison.Regarding what you want, we have two Major Arcana: Temperance and Strength.I’ve written before about how Temperance is a card of balance. That’s true here—“flirting” is balanced, “seducing” is not--but Temperance is about the act of tempering. You can temper something by mixing it with something to bring it to a proper texture (like you would for chocolate , and I think you’re trying to temper your marriage.I don’t believe you actuallywantto be with your ex. (There was a reason you two broke up. But I do think you want your husband to be fiery and passionate and tell you the same things this guy does. Maybe not all the time—he’s a shy lil’ pentacle boy—but enough that you feel desired and that there’s still a spark.Now, society is shitty to men when it comes to emotions, so your husband might generally have a difficult time expressing his deep love for you. That’s 100% possible—and something you two can talk about in couple’s therapy.I recommend counseling because you’ve already talked to your husband about wanting more romance, and he wasn’t very receptive.And this isn’t something to be ignored. Romance is vital to a relationship—it’s what differentiates “a couple” from “two roommates.”A professional can help you two talk about your issues in a way that doesn’t feel judgmental for him, and that may allow him to express his own desires in a way that you can hear.With Strength as the final card, I think you’re looking for the courage to deal with this problem head-on. I suspect it’s been bubbling under the surface even before the Knight of Wands galloped back into your life. Be honest about your feelings, marriage, and what you’re willing to accept.If your husband doesn’t want to say lovey-dovey things to you or spend more quality time, do you think you could accept that and be happy in this marriage?If he does start making some small romantic gestures, would that be enough? Would you want to outsource your romance fix with an open marriage? What is your ideal situation? What’re your husbands’? Is there a realistic way to blend those two?Strength is not a card about forcing something. It’s not a show of brute power but a sign of mutual respect. If your husband doesn’t want to change anything, you can’t force him to. And if you find yourself in a marriage that isn’t making you happy and can’t be saved, I hope you have the strength to do what you need to do.However, I don’t think you’re there yet. Start looking for a therapist who takes your insurance and talk to your husband about it. He might bristle at the suggestion, but it might help to frame it as a practical step, like a car tune-up.Also, keep an even head about your ex’s texts. Flirting is fun but you’re figuring out what you want with your husband. You don’t want to cross a line that will make that decision for you.Whatever happens, I know you have the strength to take this on.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_175,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Bodyguards flank Geert Wilders (light blue tie , Dutch right-wing politician and leader of the Party for Freedom, or PVV, as he speaks to the media after casting his vote in the Dutch general election on Nov. 22, 2023, in The Hague, Netherlands. (Carl Court/Getty Images/TNS A shock result in Dutch elections handed the largest number of the country’s parliamentary seats to the party of extreme right, isolationist, anti-immigrant and Islamophobic longtime political gadfly Geert Wilders last week. He vowed that the country would be “returned to the Dutch.”Wilders might be a relative unknown to most Americans, but he’s certainly a known quantity among those who’ve tracked and studied the rise of the global far-right. The virulent xenophobe and Euro-skeptic was something of a template for a new class of new authoritarian, less polished and martial than those who came before, with a focus on immigration and a knack for connecting with and radicalizing online right-wing communities, complete with weird hair and some kind of private-sector background.Wilders is sometimes called the Dutch Trump, but the reality is he was Trump before Trump was. He’s been a parliamentarian since 1998, and founded his Party for Freedom in 2006. His rhetoric and positions have changed little over the years. People knew what he was about.Many observers dismissed the possibility that Wilders would ever wield real power. What has changed is the electorate, which around the world has become increasingly tolerant or even supportive of far-right political movements.Less than a week prior to the Dutch elections, the far-right libertarian Javier Milei swept to decisive victory in the Argentine presidential election. Amid a faltering economy, the economist and onetime TV pundit promised, essentially, to burn it all down, dissolving the central bank, ditching the currency and engaging in a program of massive spending cuts.Many Argentines openly acknowledged that they had no idea how this was all going to pan out, but they just wanted change.The same desire for someone to come in and fix everything, to stick it to the political system, is what led voters to opt for Giorgia Meloni’s far-right government in Italy last year and to give the far-right Finns Party a sizable chunk of the Finnish governing coalition.It is what is leading the mainstream GOP, with the support of the majority of Republican voters, to coalesce around Donald Trump despite his contempt for American democracy and effort to overthrow it, his plans to weaponize the levers of government to his advantage and, crucially, his total failure to actually bring safety or prosperity to the American public.It is perhaps this latter point that’s most infuriating, as all the evidence to the contrary rarely convinces people that these far-right movements won’t deliver what they promise. They prey on dissatisfaction with a changing world and a seemingly indifferent elite, and not every one of their critiques and grievances are manufactured; things like stagnant wages, unresponsive bureaucracies and the encroaching power of tech and corporate consolidation are real issues.Yet their solutions — to blame and go after immigrants, cut government functions, vilify LGBTQ people and return to some imagined more moral past — are no solutions at all. The antidote to their venom must be an informed citizenry that can reject the snake oil. It can’t come soon enough.— New York Daily NewsA new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."

And if the Virginia Tourism Corp. has its way, that exposure will extend well beyond the commonwealth.The first installment of a new video series, titled “My Home Virginia,” launched this week on the agency’s website and YouTube channel, and it features the Dismal Swamp prominently.The video series follows prominent Virginia-based personalities to the beautiful places they love and are inspired to call home, no matter how far across the world their travels may take them. In the first episode, photographer and filmmaker Trevor Frost takes viewers through some of his favorite Virginia destinations, including False Cape State Park, Grayson Highlands State Park and the James River. But some of the most impressive footage is from our own Dismal Swamp.Frost and partner Melissa Lesh of Emerging Earth Films have impressive credentials, including the critically acclaimed, award-winning Amazon Studios documentary “WILDCAT,” which is currently available to stream on Prime Video. Frost has traveled the world as a nature and wildlife photographer, but he’s quick to note that there’s no place like home.“As a photographer who works for publications like National Geographic and spends more than half the year out of the country, I am often asked where I want to go next,” he said in VTC’s 2023 Virginia Travel Guide. “People are often shocked by that answer, which comes as no surprise. But they shouldn’t be, because Virginia is where I grew up – and places, like music, have an extraordinary ability to help us recall memories and relive experiences.”Here at home, the Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts’ newest exhibit, “Walk on The Wild Side,” will showcase artwork inspired by the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge April 13 through May 11. A free opening reception is planned for 5:30 p.m. Thursday.The exhibit features Suffolk artists Edward Higinbotham and Wayne Martin. Higinbotham is a wood carver specializing in wooden and cork decoys and sculptures. Martin is a watercolorist whose love of nature can be seen in his paintings of birds relevant to the Great Dismal Swamp.The exhibit will be open for free viewing from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day but Sunday and Monday at the arts center, 110 W. Finney Ave.The tourism video and SCCA exhibit are opportunities for locals to rediscover a gem we too often take for granted.“It’s easy to forget the beauty and wonder that exists right in one’s own backyard,” said Lesh, the documentarian. “Whether we were exploring a place I had never been before or one that I was very familiar with, filming this series was a great reminder of the incredible array of wild places and unique ecosystems that set Virginia apart, and why I like to call it home.”Watch the video at virginia.org/MyHomeVirginia.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

eugeneweekly_2023_38,"We ve got issues. My wife and I and our friends have been walking the trails around the Golden Gardens Park’s ponds for a number of years and have grown to love it just the way it is. The wildlife habitat, out off Barger west of Beltline, has become our church; where we go to spiritually recharge. Not only do the specific plants and animals matter to us, but it is one of the few places I can think of where you can see that you live in the south Willamette Valley. You can see the full sweep of the Coburg Hills to the east, the Coast Range to the west, north to Mary’s Peak, and much of the South Hills. On a clear day you can even catch a glimpse of the Three Sisters. The “development” of the wildlife habitat will consist of a major sports complex, including baseball fields, playing courts, various buildings, roads, parking lots, sports lighting and as much further “enhancement” as the city can include in order to make the complex a tourist attraction. This replacement of grassy fields with concrete, asphalt and astroturf will definitely interfere with my enjoyment of the park. But what affect will it have on the wildlife? Those fields are not empty. They are currently the home of many wild creatures and are the feeding territories of red-tailed hawks, harriers, kestrels, egrets and herons, not to mention large flocks of Canada geese, robins, swallows and killdeer. Does my desire to preserve the full extent of the wildlife habitat make me a NIMBY elitist? Well, the “development” of the park won’t affect the resale value of my house as it probably will affect the houses that currently surround the park. And I do confess to not being a sports fan. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. With that said, I want to ask the proponents of the complex, and Eugene in general, a question. What do you think Eugene’s children will need most in order to cope with what will be the defining challenge of their lives, namely the increasing tension between global warming and ecological overshoot on the one hand, and our society’s increasing pursuit of infinite growth on a finite planet, on the other? More sports complexes? Or more places where they can learn to appreciate the limits that nature imposes on growth? If Golden Gardens Park must be “developed,” I suggest turning parts of it into a permaculture experimentation site, which would not only enrich the curriculum of local students, but perhaps attract eco-tourism dollars. I encourage more folks to visit the park and form their own opinions and share them with city planners. This viewpoint has been updatedto reflect the city’s bond measure does not affect development at the park."

Any criminal who’s casing a neighborhood might think twice — not only for that night but also for the future — if he sees a bunch of neighbors outside.National Night Out has evolved over the course of many years in Suffolk. Some of the celebrations still look much like they once did, with a few neighbors sitting around outside and sharing refreshments. Some celebrations have grown exponentially, like the one that takes place at King’s Fork Middle School and involves a number of surrounding neighborhoods with lots of food, entertainment and activities for the youngsters.But the core value of National Night Out remains the same, and that’s to fight crime through better police-community partnerships and better relationships among neighbors.We urge folks in Suffolk to get involved in one of their local celebrations. Most start around 5:30 or 6 p.m. and go until 8 or 9 p.m.If you want a great overview of what National Night Out is all about, the send-off event is set for 5:00 p.m. Tuesday in the City Council Chambers at Suffolk City Hall, 442 W. Washington St.Mayor Michael D. Duman, City Manager Al Moor, Police Chief Alfred Chandler and Fire Chief Michael Barakey will be among the dignitaries present to help kick start the evening’s fun.Following the ceremony, tour groups in seven motorcade units will venture out across the City of Suffolk to visit the registered parties and enjoy the NNO fun. To find a community party near you, visit the “Where The Parties Are!” tab at suffolknno.com.Suffolk has celebrated National Night Out for nearly two decades and a number of times has placed first in the nation in its population category.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_122,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The move by House Republicans Wednesday to formally open an impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden was perhaps predictable back in January 2021 — with then-President Donald Trump’s second impeachment, for his role in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol — or even as far back as December 2019, with Trump’s first impeachment, for trying to strong-arm Ukraine’s government into helping him win reelection.But that predictability doesn’t make the GOP’s Biden impeachment inquiry any less of a cynical, pathetic stunt. Though Wednesday’s vote made the process official, House Republicans have already been thrashing around for a year trying to find something/anything on Biden that is remotely impeachable. There’s nothing.Yet they’re formally moving ahead anyway, barely bothering to disguise that they are merely seeking payback for the two fully justified impeachments against Trump by launching a patently unjustified one against Biden.If it wasn’t inevitable before Wednesday’s short-sighted House action, it probably is now: Every president in the foreseeable future who faces a House held by the opposing party will just automatically come under an impeachment inquiry, justified or not.The crux of Republicans’ allegations against Biden, such as they are, center on the various business schemes of his son Hunter Biden. The younger Biden is in fact a shady underachiever who has tried to leverage his last name for profit and who perhaps belongs in prison. He may be headed there; he is currently under indictment on federal tax and firearms charges.The problem for House Republicans is that their attempts to prove President Biden was corruptly involved in his son’s dealing have produced nothing.No, Biden’s pressure on Ukraine to fire a crooked prosecutor while he was vice president wasn’t an attempt to protect his son from prosecution for his business dealings there. Biden was doing the bidding of the Obama administration and international organizations that wanted the prosecutor out because he wasn’t doing his job.No, there’s no evidence that Biden thumbed the scales at the Justice Department to protect his son from prosecution. Again, the younger Biden is currently facing felony charges.No, the $4,000 Hunter Biden paid to his father in 2018 wasn’t evidence that Joe Biden (then a private citizen was involved in his son’s schemes; it was reimbursement for a car purchase that the younger Biden couldn’t make himself because of his bad credit.Even the Republicans spearheading the impeachment inquiry say the reason for making the inquiry formal on Wednesday isn’t because they suddenly have evidence of impeachable conduct, but because it will make it easier to look for such evidence.Trump was impeached for endangering national security by trying to extort a global ally for political purposes, and then for his unprecedented betrayal of his office in attempting to overturn a valid election.Biden, in glaring contrast, is facing this impeachment inquiry for no reason but that House Republicans have made a conscious decision to politicize and cheapen an urgent constitutional function to the point of making it meaningless.—St. Louis Post-Dispatch/TNS"

Also, Ali‘i Health has provided excellent care to those I know.In regard to the medical conference, it appears nothing was accomplished. Of course not: Politicians were invited to speak.Next time, leave the politicians out, especially Mayor Mitch Roth.

Maybe we could follow the Carson City, Nevada, model and build a new hospital away from congestion, and use the current facility for the mentally ill. That system is working quite well!Why is Hawaii developing so much land if they are concerned about global warming? After all, global warming is caused by people — more people equals more global warming!If rampant development continues, more fresh water will be pumped out of the ground, and less fresh water will enter the coastal waters. That changes the natural aquatic life along Hawaii’s shores. Not to mention, the infrastructure must be in place first. This includes, roads, sewer, new hospitals, more law enforcement, etc.Henry ZendarKailua-KonaObama is thesolution for DemsThe most natural answer to the problem faced by the Democrats of Joe Biden’s age and Kamala Harris not inspiring confidence is to have Harris thanked for her service and Barack Obama selected vice president for Biden.If Biden has to step down during his next term, Obama could step in and fill out the term as president. During Biden’s time in office, they could manage their various tasks as they like, and Biden could delegate many things to Obama while maintaining his seat in the Oval Office.If the Dems don’t have a great candidate for president in 2028, they could run someone serviceable, with Obama again as VP, perhaps another senior party member who “has earned a turn at bat.” Then, should they need to step down at some point, Obama could once again serve as president.As long as he starts out as VP, Obama can serve as many terms as “fill-in president” as needed. He just can’t run for election as president again. If you win that twice, that is the limit.Members of Congress and the VP can run and be elected as many times as they and the voters like.If Obama were to do this, it would be nice to see that he has learned from his previous two terms in office and has become a more efficient legislator. Perhaps no one is better positioned to address the growing problems of our inner cities than Obama, and we certainly need strong leadership and significant improvement in that area.Carl OgussKeaauHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2023_24,"Published 5:33 pm Tuesday, November 28, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardAs temperatures plummet and winter takes its icy grip, it’s crucial for pet owners to prioritize the safety and comfort of their four-legged companions. Our loyal pets may have fur, but they are not immune to the harsh realities of cold weather. Here are some key considerations to keep our furry friends safe and snug during the chilly months.First, shelter is paramount. Ensure that your pets have a warm and dry place to escape the cold. Whether it’s a cozy bed indoors or a well-insulated outdoor shelter, providing a refuge from the biting wind and freezing temperatures is essential.Second, monitor outdoor activities. While some dogs love playing in the snow, prolonged exposure to extreme cold can be harmful. Limit outdoor time and be attentive to signs of discomfort, such as shivering or lifting their paws excessively. Consider investing in pet-friendly winter gear like coats or boots for added protection.Maintaining a proper diet is equally crucial during winter. Pets burn more calories in an effort to stay warm, so consult your veterinarian to ensure they are getting the nutrition they need. Additionally, ensure that your pet has access to unfrozen water at all times to prevent dehydration.Antifreeze is a common winter hazard that poses a severe threat to pets. Its sweet taste is attractive to them, but even a small amount can be fatal. Keep all antifreeze containers securely sealed and promptly clean up any spills to prevent accidental ingestion.Finally, be aware of the unique needs of different breeds. Short-haired or smaller dogs may require extra layers of protection against the cold, while certain breeds are better equipped to handle winter conditions. Tailor your care routine to your pet’s individual needs.As responsible pet owners, it’s our duty to ensure that our beloved companions remain healthy and happy throughout the year, even when temperatures drop.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_3,"There are any number of famous phrases about the relationship of knowledge and power:There are any number of famous phrases about the relationship of knowledge and power:Scientia potentia est(knowledge is power — Thomas Hobbes/Francis Bacon“A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.” — Alexander PopeSapientia est potentia(wisdom is power — origin unknownWisdom brings strength, and knowledge gives power. — Proverbs 24:5“The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know.” — Albert EinsteinIn this day and age of big data and information overload, it seems more and more that the phrase “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing” is the one that holds sway. We do not all have the same information, and it is harder and harder to determine how reliable information might be.On the one hand, the democratization of information is exciting. We can get things unfiltered by editors or publishers. On the other hand, everyone can post just about whatever they want, especially on social media, and quality control is often sadly lacking.We include information literacy among our learning outcomes at UH Hilo so that they can avoid the pitfalls of bad information from less than reliable sources. Whether one agrees with the information is less important than knowing if we can depend on it.Do students know that the sources from which they are getting information are relevant, credible and appropriate? Do they have a clear understanding of how to use the information they find? Acquiring these skills allows students to be empowered by the information rather than find themselves misled by bad information or bad actors.Information also needs to come in formats that we can understand and use. The University of Hawaii, like all universities, gathers all manner of information on enrollment, grades, student progress to their degrees, etc. There is so much data that one finds it difficult to pinpoint the specific information one needs.For this reason, we have recently acquired dashboards that provide visual tools to help break down and absorb the data. I am definitely a more visual learner, so charts and graphs help me understand the story the data tells. Even our faculty and staff, all well-versed in information literacy, sometimes find it easier to get to an answer from a chart than from rows and rows of numbers.Our new dashboards allow faculty and staff to see what is going on in their particular department. How quickly are students making progress to their degree in business or history? Which agriculture course is the most challenging? How many students start as pre-health majors and then switch to sociology?By looking at patterns and trends in the information, faculty are empowered to make changes to support students. We use the data as a flashlight to point the way forward, uncover things that may not be visible without these tools.Next fall, UH Hilo will formally launch its new degree program in Data Science. This new program provides an exciting career option for our students, as they will learn how to pull data and information together and present it to others. They will learn how to analyze so-called “big data” and create tools to study large quantities of information in a variety of fields.As we become more and more dependent on data and data systems, students will learn how to be the skilled professionals that gather, process, store, analyze and visualize data. They will be able to help the decision makers in any number of fields — business, health care, natural science, social services, education, etc.Data is but one type of information, however. Many organizations tout the fact that they are data-driven. That phrase has always made me uncomfortable because behind many points of data there are living breathing human beings, and all data needs to be understood in context.At the university, we seek to be data-informed. Data provides us with valuable information, but we still want to approach it with wisdom as well as understanding. The more we know, the more questions we have, to recall the phrase by Einstein above.Wisdom, understanding and responsibility need to guide our approach to information. Just piles of data or facts do not tell the whole story of our reality. How we engage it makes all the difference.Bonnie D. Irwin is chancellor of the University of Hawaii at Hilo.

suffolknewsherald_2023_248,"Published 4:41 pm Tuesday, July 11, 2023ByJen Jaqua1972 saw a continuation of the Vietnam War, despite multiple attempts at peace talks. In March, the U.S. command said it was sending home 4,940 American servicemen — the second-largest troop withdrawal since de-escalation of the Vietnam War began in 1969. Simultaneously, officers ordered B-52s on 13 bombing runs in the northern section of the country, marking the highest point in air attacks against suspected Communist positions in more than two weeks. On the ground, one American soldier was killed and eight wounded in skirmishes near Saigon. Two South Vietnamese were killed and seven wounded, and Communist casualties were listed at 44 killed in the 24-hour period.Violence wasn’t limited to Vietnam, however. In August, the Federal Aviation Administration, declaring an emergency exists, ordered airlines to search any passenger who fit the “profile” of a hijacker. The FAA also began placing metal detecting devices at air terminal gates. The order followed the year’s 28th hijacking. FAA Administrator John Shaffer said airlines would be required to prevent from boarding a plane any ticket holder who fits the FAA’s “security profile” unless he submits himself and his luggage to a search. FAA officials refused to disclose what constitutes the profile, but a spokesman said, “We don’t rely on the fact that someone thinks a guy looks sneaky.”The world took notice of the rising conflicts in September at the 1972 Olympics. A front-page story detailed the violence while also announcing that the games would go on. “The 18 ½ hours of terror began at 4:30 a.m. when seven members of the extremist Black September Movement, their guns blazing, burst into the apartment complex of the Israeli team in Olympic Village, fatally wounding two members of the Israeli squad. It ended at Fuerstenfeldbruck Air Base, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization installation 28 miles from Munich, just before midnight, when a carefully laid ambush by German forces exploded into a bloody shambles. Although four of the guerrillas and a Munich policeman died in the shooting, one of the terrorists exploded a hand grenade inside a helicopter that had brought them and their hostages from the village. The explosion killed all nine Israelis.”The world seemed to be moving faster and, according to a story in June, it had in fact moved too fast. “Time will stand still for one second at midnight, June 30. The pause is necessary to bring radio signals from the Royal Greenwich Observatory, which are used to set clocks all over the world, back to true Greenwich Mean Time GMT. By the end of June the signals would be almost a second faster than true GMT, which is measured by the position of the sun relative to the Greenwich Observatory.”Locally, big things were happening. Nansemond became a city on July 1, 1972. It included the areas of Holland and Whaleyville in the new city.In November of the same year, voters in both Suffolk and Nansemond voted to merge into a new city of Suffolk to come into being Jan. 1, 1974. In Suffolk, more than 86% of all voters approved the merger plan, while in Nansemond, the percentage of approval was 72%. Only one precinct in either city, Ebenezer, voted against it.Former Gov. Mills B. Godwin hailed the merger vote as “the right decision.” “Now,” said Godwin, “we can unite to build a bigger and better Suffolk.”Bigger and better was in the works. A seven-store shopping mall in the center of downtown Suffolk was rapidly nearing completion. The first shop, a woman’s accessory establishment, opened in September. The mall was expected to benefit from pedestrian traffic taking a shortcut to and from other downtown shops.Just west of downtown Suffolk, Ramada Inn, a “102-room luxury motel,” was expected to open in the spring of 1973.Earlier in the year, Virginia Tourism took issue with a song called “Virginia is for Lovers.” Travel service commissioner Marshall E. Murdaugh asked the Attorney General if there was some way the song could be kept off the market, or at least its name changed. The title, of course, is also the Old Dominion’s official tourist slogan.The slogan was intended by its authors to convey to tourists the message that Virginia is for lovers — lovers of history, beaches, mountains, and of other things related to the Old Dominion. Jim Richard and Bobby Abshire of Roanoke, the promoter and writer-singer, respectively, of “Virginia is for Lovers,” however, expressed a different idea. According to the story, “the tune includes such priceless information as the availability of “moonshine to please you, whether day or night,” and “We’ve got a history of the Civil War that will warp your brain.”On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

And Jack Frost doesn’t live here, not even on the mauna. So, why do I keep humming that song? Because it’s starting to look a lot like Christmas, even on tropical islands.Bah humbug. There’s another holiday favorite from Charles Dickens who introduced us to Ebenezer Scrooge and his ghosts. In fact, the word “scrooge” is an official part of the English language, a reminder of the grumpy cheapskate from “A Christmas Carol.”Christmas or Christ’s Mass was first designated by 4th century Romans on December 25 which coincided with non-Christian festivities celebrating winter solstice and the end of harvest.Today, many cultures around the world participate in this merry season of overindulgence so it’s not only in the U.S. where we go bonkers at Yuletide.Owning up to personal pupule-ness, I confess to sending out ‘ukumillion Christmas cards, even to friends and relatives across town.Right after Thanksgiving, I started searching for a picture perfect one with sincere but not schmaltzy greetings, appropriate for various traditions.Once found, I spent days writing personal notes, addressing envelopes, then headed to the post office for stamps. Waiting in line, I studied the many artful designs and picked just the right one to carefully affix on my towering stack of sealed cards before stuffing them into the shiny blue USPS receptacle.That done, I relaxed and waited for holiday greetings that slid in through our mail slot until one arrived from the long-lost acquaintance whom I had forgotten. Yikes! So, now began the scramble including another run to the drugstore where only hideous offerings remained.Every year, we received family photos, and every year I vowed to do one. A picture is worth a thousand words, yes? But before smart phones and digital cameras, this was a big job. Months away, I would have to designate a day to dress up the clan, load the Kodak Instamatic, pester a friend to take 24 poses of our happy ‘ohana, drop the roll of film off at the camera shop and a week later at pick up, hope there would be at least one decent snapshot to share with the world.Maybe I could substitute a photo in place of my handwritten greetings, but just thinking about getting it done wore me out.Technology makes this easier now, but children are scattered and parents are falling-down old. Is it too late? Yes, it is.And what about those cheerful letters summarizing the entire year? I enjoyed reading them and figured I too could compose one to copy and mail out until realizing a delaCruz family letter would fit on a postcard: We are all OK. The kids moved up a grade while parents worked their butt off. The cat ran away then came home. Merry Christmas.Nowadays, we receive fewer and fewer holiday cards. I wonder if it’s because I no longer send any. At this point, people will assume I’ve left the planet so imagine their surprise when they run into me at the grocery store.As you can guess, I’m ruminating over some of my lost Christmas traditions such as writing and mailing cards.Do I miss it? Not really. It was a different time, a different place and a different me. But thanks to our newspaper, I can still send you a heartfelt greeting.So, here are my sincere and not too schmaltzy wishes for a calm and peaceful holiday season.Mele Kalikimaka and Hau‘oli Makahiki Hou!Rochelle delaCruz was born in Hilo, graduated from Hilo High School, then left to go to college.

leoweekly_2023_45,"My father brought our family to Fort Knox in 1974, when I was five years old. He felt that the area was a great place to raise kids. Radcliff, where Fort Knox is located, is an area filled with families from everywhere in America and around the world through marriages that have been given a level playing field by the military. Being exposed to such diversity and what felt like equal opportunity in the armpit of America was, by far, the best education of my life. I learned early on that our differences enrich our hearts and that, more than anything, we’re more alike than different.Besides, kids will be kids wherever they are and whomever they are with.The population was around 14,000 when we arrived, and we were the first Estradas in the phonebook. My parents bought a house on a cul-de-sac called Senate Circle. It was a traditional suburb, but with a very eclectic crew of retired vets and their families.In many ways, growing up on Senate Circle was much like an ‘80s Benetton commercial. You may remember these if you now have to scroll to the final two options on age verification boxes. The commercials displayed fashion through culture. The clothing was bright, and all skin tones were part of their campaigns, which were sometimes controversial. I don’t think they even focused on any particular item for sale. For me, the United Colors of Benetton was my neighborhood.I met the little girl across the street who was my age — Chrissy. Her mother was German and married a backwoods Kentucky soldier. Chrissy quickly became my best friend, and I was introduced to German food, broken English, and every Christmas, giant boxes of candies direct from Germany — Kinder Eggs, gummies, and other delights that I had never tasted or heard of. This was my first experience inside the home of a family that had languages, decor, smells and ways that were different from mine.The other Latino house on the circle had five kids. The oldest and youngest were girls, but it felt like a house of nothing but boys to me. The boys loved being outdoors catching snakes in the wet forest areas near the house. They had cages lining the patio of their backyard full of whatever snakes they caught to admire. Their father was retired and an artist. I was mesmerized by him in his straw summer hat and Cuban cigar as he painted in his open garage on cool summer afternoons. His painting, bright color on a dark canvas, was full of passion. The style of their home, surrounded by yucca plants and lit with the large-bulb festival lights gave the neighborhood a Latin feel.As we all grew older and began spending nights and eating with our friends, I remember watching women preparing big pots of cabbage on the kitchen floor that turned into kimchi at the home of a Korean friend. The smell blew my mind, pungent and garlicky.I had my first homemade donut in a Vietnamese home where one would find slippers offered at the door. Another German house across the street had a huge garden in their backyard that grew tomatoes you could pick and eat straight from the vine on a hot summer day. The people there smelled as earthy as the garden — no deodorant — and the inside of the house was equally primal.My Black friends smoothed their skin with cocoa butter and wore night caps. It was female energy and I found myself fascinated with hair braiding and twisting, as well as the beads they threaded onto their locks. I remember how they hated brushing their hair as much as I did and the humidity was relentless on us all.One summer night, Chrissy’s dad skinned and butchered a deer on her metal swing set, and the schnitzel that came from the slaughter was deep fried and crispy, and I learned the truth about where meat came from, even if it disturbed me at the time.My home brought menudo to my friends as we ate unknown pig parts that cooked the whole day before serving at breakfast the next morning. I can still see the clear blue eyes of Chrissy eating the pig knuckles right off the bone beside me at the kitchen table.Neither of us had a clue what we were eating but we were nourished in more ways than one.There were other families I was not as intimate with but their children were my friends, the blunt New Yorkers, more Germans, Irish and Puerto Ricans. I learned via exposure to all the subtle differences in hair, skin, dialect and belief systems that laid a foundation of competency that I utilized daily in my career as a social worker. In the end, we all embraced one another and the differences made it all the more magical, soulful, and open — as it should be. •Subscribe to LEO Daily newsletters.|NewsBreak (coming soon ||||*** ."

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_22,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°While under oath this week Donald Trump was instructed to answer questions about his financial documents as part of New York Attorney General Tish James’ civil fraud trial over allegations that he illegally altered the value of his assets.Unsurprisingly, the former president and would-be coup leader tried to answer very little, instead turning Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron’s courtroom into yet another venue for his never-ending campaign and crusade against his enemies real and perceived. In a representative exchange, he called the federal and state prosecutors looking into him “all haters.”It’s easy to snicker at Trump’s sophomoric attitude, his inability to keep calm even when his business — the source of his very identity and mythology — are on the line, his pettiness, his casual disregard for legal process. It all feeds into the image of Trump as buffoon, a kind of petulant and malignant forever child who’s always good for a laugh, an image that certainly provides comfort to his many liberal and moderate detractors.Yet that’s not necessarily the right way to view the theatrics on display in the courtroom downtown. To regard them as farce or entertainment ignores just how dangerous the underlying motivations are. Trump’s deepest and perhaps sole true belief is that he is beyond any reproach or accountability, owed nothing but devotion and subservience, and incapable of error.It might strike us as funny that he seems so intent on attacking the very judge that has the power to impose huge fines, hollow out his fraud-riddled real estate operation and remove him from the business via a prohibition on serving as a corporate officer. Really, though, it’s a display of power. Trump is indicating that he doesn’t care or doesn’t have to care what the judge rules, either because he’s already posturing for an appeal or, more likely, because he believes he’s simply untouchable by the law.This was driven home not just by Trump but his lawyers, particularly the similarly unpleasant Chris Kise, who among other things told the judge, when asked if he could control his client, that they should just allow the “former and future chief executive of the United States” answer how he pleased. The implication was clear: Trump is practically preordained to retake the executive reins of the country (note that Kise didn’t simply say “president” but used the term more commonly associated with the generally unconstrained leader of a corporation and he has the absolute right to answer or not answer questions as he likes, something a lowly judge shouldn’t be able to constrain.From the start, Trump and his team has treated this and every other inquiry into his wrongdoing as a politically-motivated overreach, which would already be concerning if they were not also drawing up plans to exact supposed revenge via taking political control of the federal law enforcement apparatus the second he gets back in the White House.In that light, turning Engoron’s courtroom into a circus is much more sinister than it is amusing. Trump is sure that he just has to wait out the clock until he can get elected again and then will finally free himself from any remnants of legal inhibitions. For that reason alone, he can never be allowed back.— New York Daily NewsRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

eugeneweekly_2023_43,"We ve got issues. Imagine you have just turned 18. You’re invited by an upperclassman to your first college party. You don’t have any friends at the university yet, so you welcome the invite, hoping to make a few new connections. You arrive at the party with your new upperclassman acquaintance, and he serves you drink after drink. Eventually, he’s tipping your cups back, forcing liquor down your throat. Throughout the night, he gets more aggressive, isolating you from conversations with other people and pulling you away from potential friendships. He says there’s another party at his friend’s house around the corner, so you leave with him, expecting to walk into another rager. You walk through the door to find two guys sitting on a couch smoking weed from a bong. You’re very drunk and uncomfortable now, trying to make small talk with the stoners on the couch to avoid the persistent intoxicated man who led you here. One more drink, he insists, mixing it himself, much too strong. You wake up the following morning over a toilet in a stranger’s apartment with fragmented memories of that same upperclassman straddling you on a bed and forcing you to perform oral sex while in and out of consciousness. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. My story is unfortunately not unique. The period between the start of the fall term and Thanksgiving break, known as “the red zone,” sees a significant increase in campus assaults. College-aged women from 18-24 are three to four times more likely to experience sexual violence, according to RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network . But what happens after the assault is equally traumatic. Perpetrators of sexual violence, especially in university settings, are rarely punished for their crimes. Even if victims do report the assault, abusers are often let off with nothing more than a warning. Meanwhile, victims may suffer for years, even decades, after their assault. In my case, my abuser finished his degree elsewhere, with a mild slap on the wrist. He went to jail for a few days before his parents bailed him out. He now has a successful career, and I can’t even find his name online related to sexual assault, despite supposedly registering as a sex offender. He even got to write an anonymous opinion piece for the campus newspaper, theDaily Emerald, as part of his “punishment” because he was a journalism major. But so was I. Why was I left with my own silence while the district attorney and the detective working my case, both male, offered my abuser an opportunity in his field of choice? I remember the judge telling me after reading my victim impact statement that it was the most forgiving statement he had ever seen in his career. At the time, I took that as a compliment, thinking it meant I was a good person because forgiving makes you good, right? Now, looking back, I realize I should have pushed for harsher punishment. Whatever emotional upset he had experienced in those few months when I was fighting to see justice served to a criminal couldn’t even begin to compare to the years of PTSD flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety and panic attacks that the future held for me. And the $221.95 I had won to cover my medical expenses felt more like a slap in the face than justice for the victim of a crime. A little more than $200 for medical expenses wouldn’t even cover more than a single therapy appointment, and almost 10 years later, I still have nightmares of him on top of me, crushing my body underneath his for his own sick pleasure. My story highlights the many problems with our justice system and how we deal with sexual violence. Until our criminal justice system actually pursues justice for the victims of sexual crimes, these men (and yes, I say men, because the vast majority of sexual predators are men will continue to assault and molest and rape women (and other men without fear of consequences. Victims of sexual assault need to be heard, believed and supported. We need to educate ourselves and others on consent, healthy relationships, and bystander intervention. We need to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions and stop giving them a free pass to continue assaulting others. We also need to challenge the cultural attitudes and stereotypes that perpetuate sexual violence. Victim-blaming, slut-shaming and toxic masculinity only contribute to a society that allows sexual violence to thrive. In sharing my story, I hope it empowers more women to come forward, speak up and fight to change a broken system. Sarah Blakely is a writer and former student at the University of Oregon. She is also a survivor of campus sexual assault."
suffolknewsherald_2023_161,"Published 5:24 pm Friday, January 6, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardLong a regional treasure, the Great Dismal Swamp is getting overdue national appreciation.Last month, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved the Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area Act, which now has been signed into law by President Joe Biden. The law directs the secretary of the interior to assess the suitability and feasibility of designating the Great Dismal Swamp and its associated sites as a National Heritage Area.National Heritage Areas are private-public partnerships that support historic preservation, conservation, recreation, tourism and educational projects. In order for a site to be designated a National Heritage Area, a feasibility study is often conducted. If the Great Dismal Swamp is designated as a National Heritage Area, it will get access to much-needed technical assistance and support from the National Park Service “while also maintaining full ownership, authority over decision-making and stewardship of the land.”Credit for the new federal law goes to the late U.S. Rep. A. Donald McEachin, who introduced it in the House of Representatives. The House passed it in 2021, sending it to the Senate, where Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner were strong advocates. We’re pleased to see it add to McEachin’s strong legacy of service to Suffolk.To the uninitiated, the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge might seem like just a great empty space on the map of southeastern Virginia, but the area is truly one of the great natural resources of the East Coast.Folks from across the country come for the annual spring birding festival and fall hunts, as well as activities such as tours, fishing, hiking, biking, canoeing and kayaking. The swamp’s rich cultural history, including its ties to the Underground Railroad, offers an important historical perspective.It is also an economic engine for Suffolk. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service studies over the years have estimated it contributes millions annually to the local economy in the form of retail sales, taxes and job income related to visitor spending for recreation activities.We commend Refuge Manager Chris Lowie and all who have advocated tirelessly for the Great Dismal Swamp over the years.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_75,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°The collapse of the House Republican majority into chaos is the clearest possible evidence that the party is off the rails.Of course, the Republican Party hasbeenoff the rails for a while before now. This was true in 2010, when Tea Party extremists swept through the party’s ranks, defeating more moderate Republicans — and pretty much any other Republican with an interest in the actual work of government — and establishing a beachhead for radical obstructionism. It was true in 2012, when many Republican voters went wild for the likes of Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich in the party’s presidential primary, before settling on the more conventionally presidential Mitt Romney. But even then, Romney reached out to Donald Trump — famous, politically speaking, for his “birther” crusade against President Barack Obama — for his blessing, yet another sign that the Republican Party was not on track.The truth of the Republican Party’s deep dysfunction was obvious in 2013, when congressional Republicans shut down the government in a quixotic drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and it was obvious in 2016, when Republican voters nominated Trump for president. Everything that has followed, from the rise of influencer-extremist politicians like Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado to the party’s complicity in insurrectionist violence, has been a steady escalation from one transgression to another.The Republican Party is so broken that at this point, its congressional wing cannot function. The result is that this period is now the longest the House of Representatives has been in session without a speaker. And as Republican voters gear up to nominate Trump a third time for president, the rest of the party is not far behind. The only question to ask, and answer, is why.One popular answer is Trump, who, in this view, is directly responsible for the downward spiral of dysfunction and deviancy that defines today’s Republican Party. It’s his success as a demagogue and showman that set the stage for the worst of the behavior we’ve seen from elected Republicans.The problem, as I’ve already noted, is that most of what we identify as Republican dysfunction was already evident in the years before Trump came on the scene as a major figure in conservative politics. Even Trump’s contempt for the legitimacy of his political opponents, to the point of rejecting the outcome of a free and fair election, has clear antecedents in conservative agitation over so-called voter fraud, including efforts to raise barriers to voting for rival constituencies.Another popular answer is that we’re seeing the fruits of polarization in American political life. And it is true that within both parties, there’s been a marked and meaningful move away from the center and toward each side’s respective flank. But while the Democratic Party is, in many respects, more liberal than it has ever been, it’s also not nearly as ideologically uniform as the Republican Party. Nor does a rigid, doctrinaire liberalism serve as a litmus test among Democratic voters in Democratic Party primaries outside of a small handful of congressional districts.Joe Biden, for example, is the paradigmatic moderate Democrat and, currently, the president of the United States and leader of the Democratic Party, with ample support across the party establishment. And in Congress, there’s no liberal equivalent to the House Freedom Caucus — no group of nihilistic, obstruction-minded left-wing lawmakers. When Democrats were in the majority, the Congressional Progressive Caucus was a reliable partner of Biden’s and a constructive force in the making of legislation. If the issue is polarization, then it seems to be driving only one of our two parties toward the abyss.Helpfully, the extent to which the Democratic Party still operates as a normal American political party can shed light on how and why the Republican Party doesn’t. Take the overall strength of Democratic moderates, who hold the levers of power within the national party. One important reason for this fact is the heterogeneity of the Democratic coalition. To piece together a majority in the Electoral College or to gain control of the House or Senate, Democrats have to win or make inroads with a cross-section of the American public: young people; affluent suburbanites; Black, Hispanic and Asian American voters; as well as a sizable percentage of the white working class. To lose ground with any one of these groups is to risk defeat, whether it’s in the race for president or an off-year election for governor.A broad coalition also means a broad set of interests and demands, some of which are in tension with one another. This has at least two major implications for the internal workings of the Democratic Party. First, it makes for a kind of brokerage politics in which the most powerful Democratic politicians are often those who can best appeal to and manage the various groups and interests that make up the Democratic coalition. And second, it gives the Democratic Party a certain amount of self-regulation. Move too far in the direction of one group or one interest, and you may lose support among the others.If you take the internal dynamics of the Democratic Party and invert them, you get something like those within the Republican Party.Consider the demographics of the Republican coalition. A majority of voters in both parties are white Americans. But whereas the Democratic Party electorate was 61% white in the 2020 presidential election, the Republican one was 86%, according to the Pew Research Center. Similarly, there is much less religious diversity among Republicans — more than one-third of Republicans voters in 2020 were white evangelical Protestants — than there is among Democrats. And while we tend to think of Democrats as entirely urban and suburban, the proportion of rural voters in the Democratic Party as a whole is actually greater than the proportion of urban voters in the Republican Party. There is, in other words, less geographic diversity among Republicans as well.Most important, whereas nearly half of Democrats identify themselves as either “moderate” or “conservative” — compared with the half that call themselves “liberal” — nearly three-quarters of Republicans identify themselves as “conservative,” with just a handful of self-proclaimed moderates and a smattering of liberals, according to Gallup.Moderate Democrats can still win national office or hold national leadership. Moderate Republicans cannot. Outside a handful of environments, found in largely Democratic states like Maryland and Massachusetts, moderate Republican politicians are virtually extinct.But more than the number of conservatives is the character of its conservatism that dominates the Republican Party. It is, thanks to a set of social and political transformations dating back to the 1960s, a highly ideological and at times reactionary conservatism, with little tolerance for disagreement or dissent. The Democratic Party is a broad coalition geared toward a set of policies — aimed at either regulating or tempering the capitalist economy or promoting the inclusion of various groups in national life. The Republican Party exists almost entirely for the promotion of a distinct and doctrinaire ideology of hierarchy and anti-government retrenchment.There have always been ideological movements within American political parties. The Republican Party was formed, in part, by adherents to one of the most important ideological movements of the 19th century: anti-slavery. But, as historian Geoffrey Kabaservice has observed, “The conversion of one of America’s two major parties into an ideological vehicle” is a “phenomenon without precedent in American history.”It is the absence of any other aim but the promotion of conservative ideology — by any means necessary, up to and including the destruction of democratic institutions and the imposition of minority rule — that makes this particular permutation of the Republican Party unique. It helps explain, in turn, the dysfunction of the past decade. If the goal is to promote conservative ideology, then what matters for Republican politicians is how well they adhere to and promote conservatism. The key issue for conservative voters and conservative media isn’t whether a Republican politician can pass legislation or manage a government or bridge political divides; the key question is whether a Republican politician is sufficiently committed to the ideology, whatever that means in the moment. And if conservatism means aggrieving your enemies, then the obvious choice for the nation’s highest office is the man who hates the most, regardless of what he believes.© 2023 The New York Times CompanyHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2023_12,"I have alwayshad a strong connection to my cousin Susan. Susan was one year older than me, and we formed a special bond over a love of music and reading together for hours. She was the first person who met my creative heart and understood my budding views of the world and spirituality.We were passionate souls with an intense attraction to the arts. She played drums and clarinet and I played trumpet. We continued music through high school, and she planned on taking her love of music into a career. Susan was the first to leave the state for college in our family, and it was quite the leap for her personally and emotionally.Susan did not complete her studies, instead marrying a military man — the man of her dreams — with a life deeply rooted in farming. She was in love and left collegiate life behind to start a family.Both our lives were full and on different trajectories. That put a gap in our relationship, and sometimes we found ourselves worlds apart from understanding each other. As the years passed, we found ourselves coming together only in celebrations and deaths.Susan’s mother, Joyce, was my aunt — my mom’s sister and best friend. She passed unexpectedly in 2004, and Susan began to harden. Life was coming at her from many directions — a growing daughter and a military man living the transient military life, war, and running a farm.We were adrift from each other for many years. By the time her father died in , we were at the most distant. I could barely feel her as a part of my life, but I have a distinct memory of hugging her in the reception line at the funeral. She was stiff, yet put together with perfection — as she always was. I squeezed her hard and felt her body give with the grief she had been holding back for eleven years since her mom had died.Her facade was cracked, and I began to see the girl she used to be.I reached out to her from time to time, and life wouldn’t slow down enough for the connection we needed. It wasn’t until this past year that we found time to connect again.We now meet weekly and share a few hours reflecting on who we are, where we’ve been, the many lessons we’ve learned, and how we plan to deal with the future.The space we have created together is healing — food for our weary souls — and a reminder of who we are in worlds that did not turn out as expected. We tell stories that define our lives and challenge ourselves with the openness I have needed.Yes, there are tears and then bouts of hysterical laughter that have been a staple in our relationship from day one. I see her allowing the pain to be released in a safe place before going back into a hectic life and responsibilities.Last week Susan came by and shared her breakthrough with her granddaughter.We sat on the deck and looked at the barren trees against the crispness that only comes in fall. A core memory was about to happen for both of us.Susan keeps an immaculate home and takes care of her things. On a chaotic night at her home, where all three grandchildren and her daughter were unexpectedly hanging out for the evening, she found herself frantically preparing sandwiches that suited all the requests from the little ones while her daughter completed an online class.They went outside to watch an amazing sunset.Her granddaughter was in the swing. Being a child, she began swinging right and left as well as back and forth. She hit the wall several times, and Susan had to scold her for it. At the same time, her grandson jumped on the swing and sent it against the wall yet again.Susan began to tear up. Her dam was breaking.Instead of leaving the moment in uncomfortable discipline, she decided to share why she was so protective of a swing, something that can be easily replaced.She looked into her granddaughter’s eyes, allowing herself to be vulnerable. She shared the reason why she was protective of the swing and why it was special to her: Her husband bought it for her right before her mother died.Her mother’s death was prolonged and excruciating to witness. Susan found herself working days and spending evenings by her mother’s side. Bill, her husband, would always be in that swing waiting for her to get home safely. It kept her going and was a beacon for her.Her granddaughter listened to her intently and put her arms around Susan’s neck to comfort her. That moment of vulnerability with her grandchild offered Susan another moment of healing, and understanding and was a healthy, emotional education for a child who has yet to experience grief herself.As she told me the story, we were both in tears and let them flow. It was as necessary as any wound that refused to heal until it was cleaned out and tended. For me and Susan, this was a moment we needed — a nexus — this fall, on my back porch.•*** ."
eugeneweekly_2023_14,"We ve got issues. Former Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan left office in disrepute, but on one important occasion she did her job well. Her successor, LaVonne Griffin-Valade, will need to do the same — under conditions far more stressful than those Fagan faced. In the fall of 2022,New York Timescolumnist Nicholas Kristof was generating buzz as an outsider candidate for governor. A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Kristof looked like an exciting new force on the political scene. But officials in the Elections Division concluded that he did not meet the Oregon Constitution’s requirement of three years’ residency before a gubernatorial election. Kristof was outraged, telling Twitter followers that “A failing political establishment in Oregon has chosen to protect itself, rather than give voters a choice.” The Oregon Supreme Court, however, ruled unanimously that Fagan had acted correctly. She emerged from the conflict looking better than her detractors. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Now Griffin-Valade must decide whether Donald Trump is “qualified” for Oregon’s Republican presidential primary ballot. Compared to this choice, Kristof’s case was a walk in the park. Is Trump disqualified from federal office because he has “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof” by his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol? The “insurrection” test is enshrined in Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment. Did Trump cross the line? Surely, he walked right up to it: While a violent mob was assaulting law enforcement and chanting “Hang Mike Pence,” Trump encouraged them, tweeting that “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done.” Pence escaped the assault by a stroke of luck; by another, the U.S. government was not overthrown by mob action and official connivance. I have taught constitutional law for 30 years. If I were secretary of state, I would still have to think hard about two questions: First, is Trump disqualified by Section Three? And, second, who has the authority to decide that? Last month, two outstanding scholars concluded that Trump is disqualified, and that the duty of barring him from office falls to, among others, America’s 51 secretaries of state. William Baude of the University of Chicago and Michael Stokes Paulsen of the University of St. Thomas, staunch conservatives and adornments of the Federalist Society, published a paper, “The Scope and Force of Section Three,” laying out the history behind that conclusion. They contend that Section Three applies to Trump’s actions on Jan. 6, and that his disqualification is “self-executing”— it doesn’t require a conviction, court action or legislative vote. As of Jan. 7, 2021, they argue, Trump simply has been ineligible to serve as president. Any official who has sworn to support the Constitution, they suggest, must treat his candidacy as void. Trump has made little secret of his plan to return to the White House and engineer what he called “the termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution.” If Baude and Paulsen are right, then Griffin-Valade is one of the republic’s lines of defense. It would be not her choice but her duty to bar Trump from the Republican primary ballot. Other constitutional scholars have joined the chorus in recent weeks — the most prominent being Harvard professor Laurence Tribe and former Federal Judge J. Michael Luttig. Two out-of-state advocacy groups have already written to Griffin-Valade urging her to take similar action. Under Oregon law, presidential primary candidates reach the ballot in one of two ways. First, the secretary may list any candidate “generally advocated or … recognized in national news media”; second, a candidate may submit the signatures of at least 6,000 voters. The announcement of “generally advocated” candidates comes at the end of January; the decision about candidates by petition takes place in March. Whatever Griffin-Valade decides, the question is all but certain to end up in court. She will face partisan blowback and even potential danger either way. We as citizens are entitled to send her our views, but we are not entitled to demand that she decide the issue one way or the other; fulfilling an oath is a matter for a detailed legal opinion in the first instance and, in the second, the individual conscience of the official. But what we should expect is that her office will make the decision with the same dispassion, care and scorn for partisanship that Fagan showed when she blocked the popular Kristof in 2022. ν"
suffolknewsherald_2023_4,"Published 1:42 pm Tuesday, July 4, 2023ByJen JaquaIn March of 1970, the sun went out, or so it seemed. On March 7, about 5,000 amateur astronomers and some professional skywatchers visited the area to view the Eastern United States’ last total solar eclipse of the century. The total eclipse lasted about three minutes.“The racing shadow of the moon penciled an 85-mile-wide path up the populous eastern U.S. seaboard from Florida to Maryland like a gathering black tropical storm to the oohs and aahs of once-in-a-lifetime watchers. Chickens roosted, frogs croaked as at eventide, squirrels went to sleep, horses hung their heads, and even buzzards circling a Georgia swamp swooped down to roost on bare cypress trees. In Washington, D.C., about 100 young men and women gathered in concentric circles, holding hands and humming Eastern chants. They snakedanced their way through a crowd of several thousand eclipse-gazers gathered at the base of the Washington Monument, and their long-haired leader led them through Indian prayers.”This was the first total eclipse of comparable magnitude and duration since 1878.In April, the Bennett’s Creek Rescue Squad began operation. It served the northeastern section of Nansemond County with two rescue vehicles and 45 trained men. During the day, an emergency vehicle was stationed at Bennett’s Creek Farm Market. Nights and weekends, the vehicle was stationed with the other at the squad’s headquarters building, near the entrance at the Frederick Campus at Tidewater Community College.On May 4, 1970, National Guardsmen opened fire, killing four Kent State University students during a campus antiwar demonstration. Ten additional students were wounded, three critically, in the three-second volley from the rifles of about 20 guardsmen who were retreating under a barrage of rocks thrown by demonstrators. Allison Krause, 19, Sandra Lee Scheuer, 20, Jeffery Miller, 19, and William K. Schroeder, 19, died in the gunfire. Gov. James A. Rhodes, who sent guardsmen onto the campus during a weekend of rioting triggered by President Nixon’s Thursday night broadcast announcing U.S. troops had entered Cambodia, called it “the saddest day I have known as governor.”Businesses opened up all over Suffolk. Russell & Holmes, one of the largest shoe stores in the nation, opened its doors July 30, 1970. The new store was at 139 N. Main St. Construction on a Safeway Inc. Supermarket, a national grocery chain, began in early 1971 on almost two acres of property at the southwest corner of North Main Street and Constance Road.Starting June 30, 1971, Virginians began living under a new constitution, one that committed the state to cleaning up the environment and assuring quality education for everyone. A.E. Dick Howard, assistant dean of the University of Virginia law school and executive director of the constitutional commission, said the charter marks “a return to self-government … the first time in 100 years the people have had a say in their state constitution.” He said Thomas Jefferson believed Virginians should rewrite their constitution every generation to meet contemporary needs.Among other things, the new constitution: provided for annual sessions of the General Assembly, continued the prohibition against a governor succeeding himself, committed the state to clean air, pure water and a quality environment, obligated the state to assure free public schools and acknowledged the goal of “high quality” education for all, forbade governmental discrimination on grounds of religion, race, color, national origin or sex, provided freer access to the voting franchise, including shorter residency requirements, while retaining the minimum voting age at 21.The new constitution removed the prohibition against lotteries. Among the provisions not carried over from the old constitution were those relative to the poll tax, which the U.S. Supreme Court declared illegal, and such anachronisms as the regulation of canal companies and dueling.Starting with the Sept. 14, 1971, Democratic primary, voters were required to cast their ballots in the ward or precinct where they actually reside. It had been a common practice that voters continued going to their old voting place even though they had moved to a different part of the city.In December 1971, scientists at the Stanford Research Institute announced they had started to build a computer that could converse with its programmers, answering questions verbally. Dr. Bertram Raphel, manager of the artificial intelligence program, said the computer would be able to speak its answers as long as its questioners limit themselves to a 1,000-word vocabulary, programmed into the device, and as long as they speak clearly in “pure American male English.” The computer might have trouble with slurred words, Raphael said, and women have a different way of talking. There is a big advantage of a computer that can be spoken to, he said, because “as it is now, computers can only be used by people who type or can punch cards.”Jen Jaquais the creative director for the Suffolk News-Herald.

suffolknewsherald_2023_136,"Published 6:25 pm Friday, February 3, 2023ByLetters to the EditorEditor:The recent debate surrounding the designation of interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural and club athletic teams and sports based on biological sex has sparked a lot of interest and discussions across the Commonwealth and is specifically being addressed in the Virginia General Assembly. This bill is a necessary step to ensure equity in play, nondiscrimination against biological females and safety during athletic competitions involving female sports.House Bill 1387 patron Del. Greenhalgh addresses equity and fairness in female sports in Virginia. While some believe that to preserve female sports for biological females is discriminatory, I would argue that these bills are a necessary step to ensure equity in play, nondiscrimination against biological females and safety during athletic competitions involving female sports.In the study, “The Impact of Hormonal Factors on Athletic Performance,” (Hormones and Behavior, 2015 found that testosterone does play a significant role in athletic performance, males being higher than females. This was further supported by the study published in Sports Medicine in 2017, “The Relationship between Testosterone and Athletic Performance in Men and Women,” which concluded that testosterone levels have a significant impact on athletic performance.House Bill HB1387 requires schools and institutions of higher education to designate their athletic teams and sports based on biological sex, which proponents believe will ensure fairness and safety in athletic competition. I would agree and argue that biological sex is a clear and objective criterion, while gender identity is a subjective and often changing characteristic, most often giving the innate physiology of the male an advantage, even creating a dangerous and unfair playing field for female athletes.Bill 1387 also creates a civil cause of action for any student that suffers harm as a result of a knowing violation of a provision of the bill by a school or institution, or as a result of the student’s reporting a violation of a provision of the bill by a school, institution, athletic association or organization. This protects students and provides them with a legal recourse if they feel that their rights have been violated.Greenhalgh’s bill, HB 1387, is absolutely necessary to ensure fairness and safety in athletic competition, one of the very objectives of Title IX, the Federal Code most commonly known for seeing that women’s sports are treated equitably. In K-12 athletics especially, the disparity between female and male testosterone levels play a significant role and should be a deciding factor to assure safety for female athletes, a fair playing field and to safely preserve all spots on female teams that biological females rightly deserve.Sherri StorySuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_209,"Published 5:11 pm Tuesday, August 29, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardTeachers and students from Suffolk Public Schools may very well be glancing at their calendars with a mixture of joy and dread over the figurative Big Red Circle on the calendar that marks Sept. 5, the end of a summer vacation that will seem all too short for some and far too long for others.Ready or not, though, all of Suffolk’s students will be back in their classes by this time next week. Having enjoyed one last long holiday weekend with family and friends, those who head to school Tuesday morning can be divided into two groups — those who will take advantage of the opportunity they have in America for a first-rate, free education and those who ignore the gift placed before them and choose to live only up to society’s low expectations.For those who grab onto the opportunity and pursue the goal of the true American Dream — a better life than that of those who have gone before them — the path will be full of twists and turns, ruts and potholes. It’s not easy, after all, to achieve a dream. And nothing easily achieved will be long remembered or valued, anyway.For those who choose the path of simply sliding by in school, things will be much easier for the time being. But the harvest they reap will likely be meager, in proportion to what they sowed during those seemingly carefree days.It’s especially hard for teenagers to see the reward of the work they do in high school. Good teachers and involved parents help them see the benefits every day and frequently encourage them and praise them for their hard work.Here are a few of our favorite quotes that students, parents and teachers might find inspirational as they embark on a new year of learning:We pray that all of Suffolk’s students will find good teachers and involved parents or other adults who help them learn to make the most of this school year.

Families shared both tears and smiles as they held their candles close to their hearts. When Mark Yamanaka’s voice and acoustic guitar filled up the space with a heart-moving singing of “Oh Holy Night,” every individual in the room was reminded that this season, no matter how difficult, can be filled with light.Holidays may be the merriest time of the year for many, but for some, it can be a season of longing and grief — especially if their loved ones are no longer with them. Hawaii Care Choices, formerly Hospice of Hilo, organized the “Season of Light” event for the community on Dec. 13 at Wailoa State Park from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., to ensure that both individuals and families going through bereavement were provided with a space of healing and hope during this time of the year.This Candlelight Tribute ceremony was a free public event, open to all East Hawaii community members. Attendees were encouraged to bring a photo of their loved ones, but everything else — candles, chairs, cookies, beverages and even a special memorial keepsake box filled with items to help create a personal altar — was provided.The evening’s program began with music by Yamanaka, a 14-time Na Hoku Hanohano award winner and Hilo’s beloved musician. Highlights of the program included: Reflections of Christmases past by Madeline Brooks as she shared about how her deceased, beloved husband who was the Santa at Prince Kuhio Plaza for over 17 years, brought joy and hope for countless children in Hilo.A story of Christmas present was shared by Hawaii Care Choices spiritual counselor, Catherine Czerepak. Bereavement counselor Rev. Jihey Roach shared about the hope and prayer of Christmas future. Lastly, after multifaith blessings, Kahu Brian Welsh lead the group into the candlelight tribute. As each candle began to glow row by row, sadness soon transformed into gratitude and comfort. Together, the small tea light candles brought a bigger wave of light, representing the strength and inspiration that we can also bring for one another.Christina Robledo from Community First Hawaii shared, “It was so touching to hear stories, words of encouragement, and poetry from the speakers involved. I went in memorial of my late grandma, and it was emotional and comforting for me to be with others who are and have been feeling the same as I have. I hope to see this event grow because what it offers is so comforting for a community where one loss is felt by so many. Our keepsake memorial box is now sitting on our shelf; it is a beautiful reminder.”The Season of Light event will be held annually during the winter holiday season.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_63,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°On Tuesday morning, Jenna Ellis became the third Donald Trump-allied lawyer to plead guilty in Fulton County, Georgia, to state criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. She joins Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro in similar pleas, with each of them receiving probation and paying a small fine, and each of them cooperating with the prosecution in its remaining cases against Trump and his numerous co-defendants.The Ellis, Powell and Chesebro guilty pleas represent an advance for both the state election prosecution in Georgia and the federal election prosecution in Washington. While their guilty pleas came in the Georgia case (they’re not charged in the federal prosecution, though Powell and Chesebro have been identified as unindicted co-conspirators in that case , the information they disclose could be highly relevant to Jack Smith, the special counsel investigating Trump.Perhaps as important, or even more important, the three attorneys’ admissions may prove culturally and politically helpful to those of us who are attempting to break the fever of conspiracy theories that surround the 2020 election and continue to empower Trump. At the same time, however, it’s far too soon to tell whether the prosecution has made real progress on Trump himself. The ultimate importance of the plea deals depends on the nature of the testimony from the lawyers, and we don’t yet know what they have said — or will say.To understand the potential significance of these plea agreements, it’s necessary to understand the importance of Trump’s legal team to his criminal defense. As I’ve explained in various pieces, and as the former federal prosecutor Ken White explained to me when I guest-hosted Ezra Klein’s podcast, proof of criminal intent is indispensable to the criminal cases against Trump, both in Georgia and in the federal election case. While the specific intent varies depending on the charge, each key claim requires proof of conscious wrongdoing, such as an intent to lie or the intent to have false votes cast.One potential element of Trump’s intent defense in the federal case is that he was merely following the advice of lawyers. In other words, how could he possess criminal intent when he simply did what his lawyers told him to do? He’s not the one who is expected to know election laws. They are.According to court precedent that governs the federal case, a defendant can use advice of counsel as a defense against claims of criminal intent if he can show that he “made full disclosure of all material facts to his attorney” before he received the advice, and that “he relied in good faith on the counsel’s advice that his course of conduct was legal.”There is a price, though, for presenting an advice-of-counsel defense. The defendant waives attorney-client privilege, opening up his oral and written communications with his lawyers to scrutiny by a judge and a jury. There is no question that a swarm of MAGA lawyers surrounded Trump at each step of the process, much like a cloud of dirt surrounds the character Pigpen in the “Peanuts” cartoons, but if the lawyers have admitted to engaging in criminal conduct, then that weakens his legal defense. This was no normal legal team, and their conduct was far outside the bounds of normal legal representation.Apart from the implications of the advice-of-counsel defense, their criminal pleas, combined with their agreements to cooperate, may grant us greater visibility into Trump’s state of mind during the effort to overturn the election. The crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege prevents a criminal defendant from shielding his communications with his lawyers when those communications were in furtherance of a criminal scheme. If Ellis, Powell or Chesebro can testify that the lawyers were operating at Trump’s direction — as opposed to Trump following their advice — then that testimony could help rebut his intent defense.At the same time, I use words like “potential,” “if,” “may” and “could” intentionally. We do not yet know the full story that any of these attorneys will tell. We only have hints. Ellis said in court on Tuesday, for example, that she “relied on others, including lawyers with many more years of experience than I, to provide me with true and reliable information.” Indeed, Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, has indicted two other attorneys with many more years of experience — Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman. If Ellis’ court statement is any indication, it’s an ominous indicator for both men.If you think it’s crystal clear that the guilty pleas are terrible news for Trump — or represent that elusive “we have him now” moment that many Trump opponents have looked for since his moral corruption became clear — then it’s important to know that there’s a contrary view. National Review’s Andrew McCarthy, a respected former federal prosecutor, argued that Powell’s guilty plea, for example, was evidence that Willis’ case was “faltering” and that her RICO indictment “is a dud.”“When prosecutors cut plea deals with cooperators early in the proceedings,” McCarthy writes, “they generally want the pleading defendants to admit guilt to the major charges in the indictment.” Powell pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges. Ellis and Chesebro each pleaded to a single felony charge, but they received punishment similar to Powell’s. McCarthy argues that Willis allowed Powell to plead guilty to a minor infraction “because minor infractions are all she’s got.” And in a piece published Tuesday afternoon, McCarthy argued that the Ellis guilty plea is more of a sign of the “absurdity” of Willis’ RICO charge than a sign that Willis is closing in on Trump, a notion he called “wishful thinking.”There’s another theory regarding the light sentences for the three lawyers. When Powell and Chesebro sought speedy trials, they put the prosecution under pressure. As Andrew Fleischman, a Georgia defense attorney, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, it was “extremely smart” to seek a quick trial. “They got the best deal,” Fleischman said, “because their lawyers picked the best strategy.”As a general rule, when you’re evaluating complex litigation, it is best not to think in terms of legal breakthroughs (though breakthroughs can certainly occur but in terms of legal trench warfare. Think of seizing ground from your opponent yard by yard rather than mile by mile, and the question at each stage isn’t so much who won and who lost but rather who advanced and who retreated. Willis has advanced, but it’s too soon to tell how far.The guilty pleas have a potential legal effect, certainly, but they can have a cultural and political effect as well. When MAGA lawyers admit to their misdeeds, it should send a message to the Republican rank and file that the entire effort to steal the election was built on a mountain of lies. In August, a CNN poll found that most Republicans still question Joe Biden’s election victory, and their doubts about 2020 are a cornerstone of Trump’s continued political viability.Again, we can’t expect any single thing to break through to Republican voters, but just as prosecutors advance one yard at a time, opposing candidates and concerned citizens advance their cultural and political cases the same way. It’s a slow, painful process of trying to wean Republicans from conspiracy theories, and these guilty pleas are an important element in service of that indispensable cause. They are a series of confessions from the inner circle and not a heated external critique.Amid this cloud of uncertainty, there is one thing we do know: With each guilty plea, we receive further legal confirmation of a reality that should have been plainly obvious to each of us, even in the days and weeks immediately following the election. Trump’s effort to overturn the election wasn’t empowered by conventional counsel providing sound legal advice. It was a corrupt scheme empowered by an admitted criminal cabal.© 2023 The New York Times CompanyRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

We have large warehouses that have recently become our neighbors and more warehouse projects in the pipeline. There are legal reasons to slow down development, as well as quality-of-life issues for those of us already living here. We do not need to get bigger; we need to get better — better schools, better roads, better balance.Let’s allow the city to catch up on building schools and constructing roads and for the developers to grow into what is already in the development pipeline. Let’s give our citizens a break from added travel woes caused by the intense road construction throughout the city meant to accommodate the uptick in growth. If landowners want to build residential dwellings, they can do so within the current zoning designation or hold off until Suffolk can catch up to itself.All this talk of the 2045 Comprehensive Plan, have we really and truly gained a vision of what we want to be in 2045 and worked backward to 2023? I attended a recent Suffolk 2045 Community Engagement, and it was clear that citizens are frustrated about where we are today, used the opportunity to voice their current frustrations instead of sharing future vision, and cannot focus on where we could be in 2045. One attendee asked the city if we were on track to the vision of the 2035 plan, without a response. Instead of the Planning Commission and City Council focusing on rezoning, why don’t they partner up with each other, get out into the communities to hold town halls, and work on the problems of today that have not been resolved by the 2035 plan?Rebuilding trust between the city and its citizens should be a top priority for all of us. We need to halt the over-development for sake of development and the opposition so we can unite to make Suffolk better, not bigger.Dr. Sherri L.

Maybe not, so here’s the answer: The Armistice ending World War I was signed at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918.Ah yes, I remember it well …That was a joke — I’m old but not that old! In fact, I flunked my own question because I had to look it up, which makes me wonder how we found out anything before Google. Then I remembered how. We opened a volume of the nearest encyclopedia (remember those? or headed to the library, thumbing through the card catalog before browsing the stacks.Wandering among tall shelves with books going up to the ceiling, we hoped to not run into that unwashed weirdo or a couple making out. Oh, the good old days.But Veterans Day is not a time for jokes.Let’s step back for a quick review of Hawaii’s participation in American wars, beginning with more than 100 island residents who died in World War I. And who doesn’t know about the U.S. Army 100th Infantry Battalion and heroic 442nd Regimental Combat Team in World War II? In the following decades, many locals have served in the U.S. military.We remember all soldiers on Veterans Day because this is when we honor those who have fought to defend life, liberty and the American way.But we should thank veterans not just on this one day but everyday and express gratitude whenever we pig out, shop ‘til we drop, watch silly TV shows or sit on our fat ‘okole surfing the Web for whatever pops into our pea brain.So I’ll thank the nearest vet, the one I live with, my housemate of a hundred years, the guy who survived a 12 month tour of Vietnam, helped build an air base in South Korea and entered East Berlin before the Wall came down.If you talk to any veteran, he or she will recount similar assignments, so ask them and they might tell you. But be mindful because many of those memories will not be happy ones and in fact, some soldiers may have seen things that no human being should ever see, which could be the source of post traumatic stress disorder. Be thoughtful and kind.Should you thank them for their service?This nicety started in the 1990s, perhaps out of guilt for the way some Americans treated those returning from the unpopular Vietnam Conflict in the 1970s. Let’s hope you weren’t among them and heaven help anyone today who spits on soldiers back from combat in Iraq, Afghanistan or anywhere else.So maybe to compensate, we often say “thank you for your service” to members of the Armed Forces.But even if it’s sincere, many think this phrase is meaningless, similar to “have a nice day.”In the Cohen Veterans Network, 49% of polled veterans don’t like it, first because they don’t know how to reply, but maybe because it lets civilians off the hook, those who have never put themselves in harm’s way. Easy to drop a cliche then return to a cushy lifestyle.And what if it’s uttered by gun aficionados? Hey, if you’re so insistent on your right to bear arms and enamored of your Glock pistol or AR-15, then join the Army!So. Thank you for your service. Maybe the correct response is: You’re welcome.

More of Kentucky Lantern’s work can be found atkentuckylantern.com.Follow them onand.FRANKFORT — I was sitting at my desk a stone’s throw from the Kentucky Capitol googling Galileo.Was the father of modern science really shown the instruments of torture to make him renounce his belief that the Earth circles the sun?The authorities had divined that it was the other way around, that God had put them at the center of the universe. Galileo unsettled their comfy world view.Why, you may wonder, was I reading up on someone who died in 1642?Kentucky’s General Assembly had me desperate for evidence that rule by fear has an expiration date, that it works for only so long, that eventually humanity and the power of knowledge win out.That may sound naive after what we just witnessed. More than a few times, I marveled: How can these basically decent, if incurious and conservative, lawmakers be so cruel?Our Republicans weren’t marching just in lockstep with each other. They were part of some grander plan, out of an old playbook:Will it work? It might.Republicans benefitted at the polls in 2004 by putting same-sex marriage on the ballot in multiple states, including Kentucky. At least one U.S. Supreme Court justice has hinted atreversing the right of adults to marrywhom they choose and eventheir right to obtain contraception.But Americans have moved on. Yes, there are exceptions, but no one is much bothered anymore by a loving family that does not conform to an old stereotype (that never matched reality in the first place .Questions of gender identity understandably rattle the empathy-challenged and those who see things as black-white, boy-girl, us-them. Who insist the universe revolves around their beliefs.As the late-night legislative debates raised emotions, obvious bigotry against LGBTQ+ people occasionally flared.But for the most part Republicans stuck to their script that concern, even love, for children fueled their determination to act against medical advice by banning some health care for some kids. They were protecting them, they insisted, from parents who might make bad decisions, leaving those parents with one decision, whether to leave Kentucky to find care for their children.The same Republican lawmakers also insisted they had to safeguard parents’ rights by enacting restrictions on what can be read, seen or talked about in public schools.The new complaint process seems tailored to turn school board meetings into trial courts for books. The new law even has an emergency clause, launching the Inquisition in plenty of time for this fall’s governor’s race.“Gender Queer,” a graphic memoir about a nonbinary adolescent, has roused the most outrage here and elsewhere. I should read it.But even having not seen it, I’d bet that nothing in any school library comes close to matching the obscenity that Sen. Jason Howell, R-Murray, says invaded his account without his knowledge and stayed there for almost two years.Howell sponsored the rid-our-schools-of-obscenity bill and has every right to view pornography. He says hacking put the porn in his “likes.” In response toour story,several people suggested to me that his could have been attacked by bots sent to drive up followers for the porn accounts.My point: If sexually explicit material can just appear in the cell phone of a lawyer and legislator, imagine what a curious adolescent can find on the internet.Access to facts about the human body does not corrupt kids. Neither do novels, poems or sculpture. Age-appropriate education about sex, its mechanics, the feelings and questions it sparks, does not harm kids. It arms kids for what our sex-saturated culture and their own hormones throw at them.Education protects.It protects children from sexual abuse by giving them the words and, we hope, the trust, to talk to a protective adult.It’s worth noting that this legislature entertained characterizations of educators as “groomers” and indoctrinators, but killed (in the Senate a bill that would have kept real groomers, teachers found responsible for sexual misconduct with students, from moving on and getting a job at another school.Hostility toward education is a thread in Kentucky’s history. But so is protesting injustice — granted, a thinner, more fragile thread.I’m old enough to remember when queer people closeted themselves, hid who they were to avoid unsettling or inciting the established order.Those days are gone, thank God.Though the threat of violence looms still, LGBTQ+ Kentuckians and their friends, especially young people, came out and cried out against injustice and bigotry.My generation is leaving behind a god-awful mess — an economy that works for too few, a planet suffering rapid climate change, a politics that feeds on division.But the hundreds of Kentuckians who rallied at their Capitol, unafraid to show who they are and who they love, represent real progress in my lifetime.Galileo was threatened with torture, convicted of heresy but sentenced to house arrest. During those last nine years of his life he wrote a book admired by Albert Einstein who dubbed the old star-gazer the father of modern science.The supermajority’s culture warriors may rule from the center of Kentucky’s political universe. But like the rest of us, they’re riding a spinning orb, circling a star, in a moral universe that another visionary once said has an admittedly long arc “that bends toward justice.”*** ."
eugeneweekly_2023_55,"We ve got issues. The Eugene City Council met as the Urban Renewal Agency (URA during its noon Jan. 25 work session to discuss expanding the financial capacity of the Downtown Urban Renewal Plan and identify priorities associated with that expansion. “As you heard people were central to the community vision for downtown,” said Development Programs Manager Amanda D’Souza,after a brief presentationabout the status of downtown by city staff before turning over discussion to the City Council.For the next hour the council primarily discussed a map developed by the community development team and informed by a Downtown Priorities and Projects survey data which identified “Locations of Concern and Opportunity,” areas of the city they believe need improved public safety to allow for more commercial activity and private investment.Blocks were highlighted from red to orange to yellow to indicate the level of attention needed. In red, the blocks in need of the most attention according to the development team, was the corridor of East Broadway stretching from Charnelton Street to Oak Street. Intersecting streets around the Downtown Public Library, LTD bus station, Kesey Square and the Park Blocks were colored orange. “…expanding that red portion one block south, or specifically to include the 10th and Olive block quad… changing it from orange to red, would be, what I think would be very appropriate,” said City Councilor Alan Zelenka Ward 3, on adjusting the map’s specifics. Councilor Emily Semple of Ward 1, which encompasses downtown, was more direct where she wanted the highest areas of concern, “And also that red line of urgency,” Semple said, “put it dark right at Olive and Broadway, that’s where the worst of the worst is.” This possible hard red line of urgency for the worst of the worst points directly to areas where low-income or unhoused humans rely on the nearby LTD bus station for transportation and go downtown to make community and utilize social services including: the Eugene Public Library, Lane Independent Living Alliance (LILA , Emergence Addiction Treatment and Senior and Disability Services. Respondents to the URA’s community survey skewed mostly white, wealthy, and were either comfortably employed or retired, yet actions and priorities focused on the well-being of all people in the downtown, not just those who could afford to live and shop there. The most popular actions for improving the downtown were selected by survey respondents by the following percentages: “expand non-law enforcement programs that enhance public safety” (68 percent , “provide more behavioral health and addiction services throughout Eugene” (67 percent , “increase commercial activity and active storefronts” (64 percent , “provide shelters and services for people without stable housing throughout Eugene” (64 percent , and “support the creation of housing affordable for people with low incomes” (51 percent . Yet the survey results narrative puts undue emphasis on law enforcement when respondents were asked to rank their top three actions. Thesurvey data summarysays, “When asked to prioritize actions, respondents focused on police enforcement.” This is outright not true. “Increase police presence and law enforcement in Downtown” ranked only fifth out of ten top actions. The narrative also attempts to invalidate the top two priority areas, which concerned behavioral health and homelessness, considering these issues to be citywide rather than downtown-specific issues. The City Council and city staff’s fixation on literally redlining our unhoused neighbors should not be news to anyone in the city. But the flagrant nature in which the City Council and city staff fear-monger and bend data should be seen as an extension of policy that is against the interests of not just the survey respondents but most Eugene residents. We must all call on the City Council to disband the city’s archaic obsession with urban renewal promised in the mid-twentieth century. We must also pull support from our elected officials who fail to acknowledge those human beings who are most at-risk and under-served as truly central to the community vision of downtown and by extension our city. The next work session to discuss the future of urban renewal is tentatively scheduled for March.

Over the years there have been numerous deaths caused by speeding and drivers running red lights. Speeding has always been a major issue on the highways, residential areas, and school zones.Among the several locations where these cameras have been installed, the best choice to put them were in the school zone areas especially with the outstanding number of children deaths. It is important for drivers to be aware of speed limits within the school zone and stopping when a bus is stopped. Thinking back to when the young lady was hit on her way to school in Norfolk should be another reason these cameras should have some impact on drivers to let them know they cannot get away with running a red light.As a mother with small children, not only do I have concerns about highway safety, but in our neighborhoods as well. Children are not safe when they play outside due to those who speed through these small neighborhoods. It was an excellent choice for the city to review highway safety and do something about it.Since warning citations are being mailed out, I hope drivers will open their eyes and realize that speeding will not only hurt drivers but their pockets as well with the violation fees.I am thankful the city has decided to do something to help reduce the number of deaths caused by those who speed.Natasha NorfleetSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

In January 1996, the City Council adopted a false alarm ordinance in response to the extra burden on emergency service units due to increasing incidents. Fees can be levied by the fire and police departments for false alarm calls. If the fire department responded to a false alarm, charges were assessed based on the fire equipment, vehicles and personnel involved according to the time the units were in service until they were available for other calls. A warning was issued for the first false alarm call, while service fees were tagged on for each thereafter.The city got an updated bridge in April. Replacement of the North Broad Street Bridge ended the 72-year existence of the original bridge. The structure was originally constructed in 1924 on the heels of an agreement between the city, Virginia Railroads and the Coastline Railroad Co. to close a gap between Broad Street and the old Pitchkettle Road grade crossing. Approximately 3,300 vehicles used the bridge daily, according to Public Works Director Thomas G. Hines. Features of the new bridge included concrete and steel ‘Very much like the appearance of the Kingsboro bridge,” said Hines. With a slightly higher elevation than the former present structure, the replacement bridge was wider with pedestrian lights.In June ’96, an interview with James McBride, author of “The Color of Water,” put Suffolk on the map of readers. McBride said that he often visited Suffolk while drafting this tribute to his mother, Ruth McBride Jordan, and the accompanying story of his and 11 siblings’ lives growing up in the Red Hook housing projects of New York.In Aug ’96, supporters of a local businessman’s quest to keep his property – despite the city’s intent to demolish it to make room for a $14 million court complex – protested the groundbreaking ceremony downtown. The groundbreaking included dignitaries such as City Council members, former Virginia Gov. Mills E. Godwin Jr. and the judicial community. William “Bill” Beamon owned “Hot Spot Record & Tapes” on East Washington Street, one of about 10 businesses that were targeted with the wrecking ball to make room for parking around the 95,000-square-foot, tri-level building. However, Beamon was the only property owner to challenge the city legally.In the fall of ’96, the United States fired a hailstorm of cruise missiles at Iraqi air defense sites. The strike came 12 hours after President Clinton warned that a defiant Saddam Hussein must “pay a price” for his boldest aggression since the Persian Gulf War.As school began, a report from Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee For Responsible Medicine indicated that most of the nation’s schools serve much higher fat content meals than they should. Norma Frye, Food Services Director for Suffolk’s public schools, said the 16 schools over which her jurisdiction lies went beyond federal government guidelines in providing a healthy menu for students for several years. Even though there seems to be a nationwide trend to reduce fat in meals and offer leaner, healthier foods to students, the students don’t always greet the efforts with great enthusiasm. Vegetables of any kind are often not favorites. In one school, dilled carrots were greeted with “No way!” “I don’t want any,” and an adamant “Not.”Technology found its way to the hospital at the end of ’96. “He” was a perfect member of any office staff: efficient, capable, agreeable and cost-effective.

suffolknewsherald_2023_49,"Published 4:38 pm Tuesday, May 9, 2023ByJen JaquaThe United States continued its development of nuclear power, but it wasn’t the only country to do so. All of the world’s superpowers were testing and developing nuclear technology.Some of the United States’ tests included the first test of an atomic device from a balloon and atomic bombs exploded underground.In July of ’57, scientists unleashed an atomic explosion high over the Nevada desert. The force of the blast — equal to 20,000 tons of TNT — ripped an unmanned Navy blimp from its moorings in the blast area. The explosion was detonated from a balloon tethered 1,500 feet above the test site. This detonation was open to newsmen. The shock wave shook the newsmen and some 500 military observers as it rumbled past with a thunderous roar.Nuclear technology was not limited to weapons. Several innovations were made such as a dime-sized atomic battery that could power equipment. In January 1958, the keel was laid for the USS Enterprise, the first nuclear naval surface ship. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier would go on to serve the Navy for more than 55 years. (I had the pleasure of spending four years aboard the carrier and deployed overseas on it twice while in the Navy. Scientific advances were not limited to the seas. In late 1957, the world turned its eyes skyward as Russia launched Sputnik 1, followed a few months later with the U.S. launching the Explorer 1 satellite on Feb. 1, 1958. NASA announced mid-1958 plans of putting a man in space within a year.Not everybody was a fan of space exploration based on one short story. “Barking dog complaints are routine around police headquarters, but a call taken by police secretary Doris Stallings last night was too much. A man phoned to say that a barking dog was disturbing him. ‘Where is this dog?’ asked the secretary. ‘It’s on that new Russian moon,’ the man said and hung up.”On Sept. 4, 1957, National Guardsmen, following orders of Gov. Orval Faubus, forcibly prevented racial desegregation of Little Rock Central High School. The soldiers turned back a total of nine black students who tried to enter the 2,000-pupil, all-white school. Faubus maintained that the National Guard was not called out Monday night to maintain segregation at the school but only to keep “peace and order.”However, President Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and ordered them to support the integration on Sept. 23, after which they protected the Black students.Many other school districts fought court battles throughout 1957 related to school desegregation.In Virginia, pupil placement forms were required for students to attend schools in 1957. Several cases went to court when parents refused to sign the forms. The State Pupil Placement Act, passed by the special session of the 1956 General Assembly, took the power of assigning pupils to a particular school away from local school authorities and placed it in the hands of a three-man board appointed by the governor. One story about the Pupil Placement Act quoted Judge Hoffman: “Adults fight for principles, and the children suffer.” The Supreme Court later ruled the Pupil Placement Act unconstitutional.After 17 Black students were placed in six Norfolk white schools for the 1957-1958 school year, the school board closed those schools.State Senator Mills E. Godwin of Suffolk, a staunch supporter of Virginia’s massive resistance program, called for Black leadership to come forward and urge the 17 Black children who had been assigned to white schools in Norfolk to return to their own schools — and thereby permit white schools to re-open for the year.“There is no statutory or constitutional requirement in Virginia for a public school system to be maintained beyond the elementary level,” he said. Godwin said the school boards may close secondary schools in their districts at will. “These boards have the power to close certain schools and thereby see to it that those who have been responsible for the interruption of public education for white children would receive the same treatment in their own pursuit of a public education,” he said.Jen Jaquais the creative director for the Suffolk News-Herald.

eugeneweekly_2023_22,"We ve got issues. People often ask why Eugene’s PRIDE in the Park Festival is held on the second Saturday in August every year. The easy answer is that we’re queer all year; so why not? It really comes down to logistics. Securing infrastructure needed to produce the event in June, in Eugene, is not feasible: too many other events. Plus, no rain in August! The most important reason, though, is that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, two-spirit and asexual people, as well as gender, sexuality, and romantic minorities — and others in the LGBTQ2SIA+ and GSRM communities — have always faced multiple and intersecting challenges to our health and wellbeing, and support is needed for these communities at events year-round. At almost all Pride festivals this year, and at many (including Eugene’s in prior years; attendees are greeted with signs declaring their identity invalid and worthy of condemnation. We are heckled and, as was the case at Roseburg Pride last month, arrested at our own events for attempts to mitigate the harm to our community. The constant barrage of legislation aimed at erasing us, of politicians using our identities to campaign on hate and our own internalizing of some of these messages, speaks to the necessity of holding Pride events year-round. Dedicated spaces of celebration, joy, connectedness and access to resources are essential for many queer folks. They can help ameliorate some of the disparate outcomes for the health of our community. We not only recognize these disparities; we seek to offer unique and culturally sustaining support during the festival to help address them. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. For instance, according to the 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, LGB people experience higher rates of substance use disorder. For people in recovery, attending a Pride festival can be challenging as folks are confronted with old habits that they can’t partake in any longer. For some, substance use and processing addictions such as gambling turns innocent fun into a lifelong journey of recovery. This year, we are creating a Sober Circle and facilitating a space to celebrate sobriety as well as offer educational and support resources for those struggling with addiction. We aim to shift the narrative: where folks in our community can celebrate our path to health, where your sober date is a cause for applause instead of a fear of relapse. Creating safe and entertaining spaces gives people a new voice of hope, recovery and an outlook for fun and adventure. Pride is not just an uplifting celebration for the activists and entertainers (we truly do adore our drag queens! who are in the throes of conflict in our society, but also for youth. Youth spoke up in the most recent Trevor Project study about experiencing discrimination in society, schools and even at home. Fewer than 40 percent of LGBTQ young people found their home to be LGBTQ-affirming. This often leads to increased concerns for mental health and symptoms of depression and suicidal concerns. Forty-one percent of LGBTQ young people seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year and 56 percent who wanted mental health care in the past year were not able to get it. To help alleviate these stressors, we aim to joyfully celebrate the varying identities of our kids in a dedicated Youth Zone. We hope that having a supportive space that includes fun and engaging activities helps to reduce stigma and encourages young people to live out loud in such a way that joy can be expressed instead of shame. The challenges for LGBTQ+ and GRSM people are numerous, and Eugene PRIDE is working to support as many people in our community as we are able. A Veteran’s Village will help support those who have served in the armed forces, many of whom face additional challenges above what the community faces broadly. To counter the often aggressive religious and white supremacist protesters and reclaim part of the spiritual space, an interfaith area will be hosted for conversation, processing and healing with faith allies Accessibility for disabled members of the community and people with disabilities is also top of mind, and we will have ASL interpretation on both stages, several ADA restrooms, a large, accessible parking area close to the event, water refill stations, misters and cooling neck wraps available to those who may struggle with heat. Also, we have oriented as many booths as possible toward sidewalks throughout Alton Baker Park and spaced booths out to provide air flow and ease of navigation. It is truly incredible and uplifting to attend a Pride event if you are queer and even if you’re not! You see others like you, your identity is not tolerated but celebrated, and you can build networks of support that can sustain you in a world where segments of our society would prefer we not exist. Pride is for everyone in our community, and the organizing committee will continue efforts to make our annual celebration as inclusive and supportive as we are able. Happy Pride! ν"

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_138,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the Steer N Stein bar at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 12, 2023, in Des Moines, Iowa. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images/TNS It’s a common accusation: “You just hate Trump.” But this dismissive assertion always implies a subtext: “Your hatred of Trump blinds you to his virtues and accomplishments.”Sometimes this “hatred” of Trump is called TDS—Trump Derangement Syndrome; again, your derangement has made it impossible for you to evaluate Donald Trump fairly.But whether one is deranged or genuinely hates Trump is irrelevant to this essential fact: Putting aside for a moment his less-than-impressive four years in office and his burgeoning tendencies toward authoritarianism, Donald J. Trump is just not a good man.Of course, this is only an assertion, and if you’re one of Trump’s millions of devoted supporters, you’ve already stopped reading.But if you’re among those Americans who are as yet uncommitted to either side, consider the role that a candidate’s basic character should have in how we choose who leads our nation.I’m not an expert on the 45 men (Grover Cleveland was president twice who we’ve elected to our highest office, but I’ve devoted part of the last few years to reading their biographies. I’ve made my way up through H.W. Brand’s “Reagan: The Life.” I haven’t skipped any, not even Franklin Pierce and Millard Fillmore.The presidency has been occupied by many flawed men. Some have been slaveholders, Indian killers, drinkers, incompetents, adulterers, liars and corrupt cowards. Others have been decent, honest, skillful, hardworking family men, upright, honorable and principled.Mostly, though, our presidents have been messy combinations of defects and virtues. In short, they’re like us.But in terms of basic character, have we ever had a president like Trump?Richard Nixon was a liar, but he lied with purpose, to cover up, for example, his connection to Watergate. He never boasted about the size of the crowd at his inauguration to make himself look good.John F. Kennedy was fond of women who were not his wife, but, as a rule, he didn’t treat women as disposable adjuncts to his ego. Other presidents were philanderers, as well, but none publicly ridiculed women for their looks.And Ronald Reagan, who probably did more than anyone to create and propagate the dismissive contempt for the federal government that so many Americans feel, embodied a profound respect and appreciation for our constitutional system. It is impossible to imagine Reagan attempting to subvert a legitimate election because he couldn’t bear being called a loser.In short, 44 men have served as president; then there’s Donald Trump.Here’s the odd thing: I’m acquainted with some of the people who, in their defense of Trump, have accused me of hating him. They, as a rule, are not liars. They never cheat on their wives or, if they did, they would feel guilty and not brag about it. They care more about their children than they do about themselves.They don’t contrive to defraud others. They pay their bills. They don’t brag. They’re generally able to accept defeat (except Trump’s, of course without whining and complaint. They’ve never been indicted for a slew of felonies.No, the people who charge me with hating Trump are generally good people who have more character than the man they’re defending.How much should character matter when we’re choosing a president? Trump’s defenders may argue that the quality of his administration compensates for his character flaws. But that’s a hard case to sustain in light of the wall he promised to build but never did, the $8 trillion that he added to the national debt, his shaky response to COVID and his promotion of a culture of disunity and anger.In short, you don’t have to be filled with hatred or deranged to want someone in the White House with better character than Trump. Or to imagine that we could fill the office with a man—or woman!—who is at least as good as most of us are.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."
leoweekly_2023_24,"Dear Oracle,I’m living in PA (from here & trying to move back to FL with my elderly cat. I’m having a hard time making it happen? I work from home, so I can work from anywhere; I’m in the travel industry. Will it happen? Please advise!-Looking for SunshineCards: The Chariot, Six of Pentacles, Temperance, The Magician (All reversed Dear Sunshine,A confession: I asked the cards a slightly different question for you. I know you wanted to knowifyou would move back to Florida, but since Tarot isn’t great at answering “yes or no” questions, I askedhowyou could get back to Florida—and BOY, did they have something to say! With three major arcana cards, some really strong feelings and forces are at play here, including some competing ones (more on that in a minute. First, I want to stress that you’ll need patience. With all the cards in reverse, I would say this will take longer than six months, so you’re probably looking at 2024 at the earliest. We also have Temperance, which stresses balance, moderation, and patience. You’ll have to be patient as these plans take shape, and you’ll have to keep a level head about things. It will be important to analyze risks/rewards and see the big picture…especially because your mind will be split between Chariot energy and The Magician.I’ve written before about how The Chariot is this bombastic energy. It can be potent if you are trying to get shit done because it’s a “go out and get it!” type of card. This energy is about doing whatever you need to do to get you and your cat down to the sunshine state.On the other hand, we have the equally powerful Magician. The Magician is powerful both in himself and because he’s a conduit of powers above him. He understands that there are things outside of his control.In order to get down here, you need to be aggressive about what you can do, but you also need to learn what is outside of your control. It’s a bit like The Serenity Prayer: accept what you can’t change, change what you can, have the wisdom to know the difference. You don’t want to keep hitting a wall that won’t crumble, but you don’t want to back down when you need to push through.Funny enough, I think the only minor arcana—the Six of Pentacles—might offer some advice. It is a card of generosity and sharing of gifts. It might be that someone else can help you move along, either as a benefactor or possibly as a co-conspirator. Is there anyone besides your cat that you would consider this relocation with? I would keep an open mind about where help may come from. Remember: some things may be out ofyourcontrol, but they might be controlled by someone else. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when necessary.I hope you make it down to the land of good living, my dear!Dear Oracle,As I grow more self-aware and develop boundaries, I find myself desiring to let go of certain friendships that no longer inspire me and challenge me in a healthy way. Because there is no clear guide to friendship breakups, I feel like despite my desire to end friendships, it still hurts, and I’m not completely doing it right. Is my desire to let go of these connections too impulsive? Am I doing it right?-Foe of a Friend?Cards: Three of Pentacles, The Devil (rev. , The World (rev. , Eight of Cups (rev. Dear Friend,I’ve written before about how friendship breakups can feel worse than romantic ones, partly because at least when you break up with a partner, you can ask, “Maybe we can be friends?” But when you end a friendship, it’s over. You want them out of your life completely.I don’t think you’re being impulsive. The Three of Pentacles is often a card about working well with others—but it can be a time to reflect when thingsdon’tfeel like they’re best. You know this feels off.You say you don’t feel inspired or challenged in a healthy way, which suggests you may feel challenged in anunhealthyway. The Devil can be a prison of our own making. While often about the material world, it can also be that we feel like wehaveto keep working at something, that we’re chained to this rock. But the truth is, we can slip these chains. You can set a boundary and keep from repeating the unhealthy pattern.Then there’s The World, the end of a journey and the start of a new one. I have no doubt that this friendship has meant a lot to you over the years and probably gave you a lot—but it may have run its course. Just because something ends doesn’t mean it wasn’t supposed to happen in the first place. It just means it’s time to let go. I think you know that this is the right thing to do, deep down.Unless someone is a nightmare, breakups never feel 100% good, even if you know it’s the right call. It has been hurting and will hurt—but the Eight of Cups suggests taking a different approach than what you’ve been doing. You may need to be direct and tell your friend that you want to end things. You don’t need to give a laundry list of reasons but be tactfully honest.Don’t say, “I just need some space for a little while,” if that’s not true; it’s cowardly and cruel. Be prepared that they might be furious or hurt—and for mutual friends to have opinions about it. But if this is what you need, this is what you need. Figure out how to do it with dignity so you know that you did it the “right” way.I know this is difficult, but I hope it brings you peace.Subscribe to LEO Daily newsletters.|NewsBreak (coming soon |||||*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_43,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°One reason I’m afraid that the worst is yet to come in the Middle East is that the mutual dehumanization is the most savage I’ve ever seen it in decades of on-the-ground reporting in the region.Israel’s invasion of the Gaza Strip is destroying tunnels, ammunition dumps and Hamas fighters, yes. But I’m afraid it’s also helping to pulverize the recognition of shared humanity that in the long run allows people to live beside one another in peace. The poisonous hatred in turn is already spilling over to the United States and other countries worldwide.I was thinking about this as I drove the other day to meet some Palestinians who were temporarily allowed to visit Israel and became stuck in East Jerusalem. My Israeli taxi driver refused to enter the Palestinian neighborhood (“If I go there, I won’t make it out” and finally abandoned me on the side of the road to get a Palestinian taxi. And then when I got to my destination, I interviewed a sweet 57-year-old Palestinian woman who was talking to me about the war and told me that she approved of Hamas’ attacks on Israeli civilians.I pressed her, and she insisted it was fine even to kill a 5-year-old Israeli child, because “they are all Jews and Zionists.”That conversation pretty much broke my heart. Such bigotry is nurtured by Hamas propaganda but also by Israeli bombing of Gaza: The woman said she had lost two cousins to Israeli fire, including a young woman married only a year ago, and she weeps daily at the bombardment of family and friends in Gaza.Meanwhile, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the escalation of the ground operation Saturday, he cited biblical references to the Amalekites, who were the target of a divine genocide. In the story, God’s order was: “put to death men and women, children and infants.” Netanyahu wasn’t advocating that literal policy, but Amalek is a code word that regularly crops up in Israeli politics for a ruthless enemy that must be crushed without mercy.Some have been more explicit in their biblical exegesis.“You may think you’re being merciful” by sparing a child, counsels a far-right rabbi in a chilling video posted online, but actually “you’re being vicious to the ultimate victim that this child will grow up and kill.”And this too breaks my heart.There are of course many other voices that are merciful and sensible, and I’ve highlighted them previously. But when children on both sides are slaughtered and people are fearful, it is extremists who invariably are ascendant.That is the longtime pattern in the Middle East: It was Palestinian suicide bombers who propelled Netanyahu into the prime minister’s office, and it has been Israeli hard-liners who fuel extremist Palestinian groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad.“Extremists need each other, support each other,” Eyad al-Sarraj, a Gaza psychiatrist who died in 2013, once lamented to me. He complained that Israel’s blockade of Gaza since 2007 had turned Hamas fanatics into popular heroes.Now I fear we face a prolonged war that will make the dehumanization on both sides much worse.I’m astonished by a survey finding that 51% of American 18- to 24-year-olds say that Hamas’ killings could be justified. Have they seen the butchery committed by Hamas?We’ve already also observed deadly threats to Jews and assaults on them, and posters of Israeli hostages have been torn down. A 6-year-old Muslim boy was murdered in a Chicago suburb in what police say was a hate crime: The boy was stabbed 26 times. I fear there’ll be more of this.This is a path that leads nowhere, and that’s one reason I hope Israel will rein in the bombing and pursue more surgical strikes, while avoiding large-scale urban combat. Whatever you call the Gaza war so far, it is not surgical. The Economist found, based on satellite imagery, that 13% of Palestinians have had their homes damaged in just three weeks. While the number of dead in Gaza is difficult to pin down, and many bodies are probably still uncounted in the rubble, Unicef now calls Gaza “a graveyard for thousands of children.”The Oct. 7 Hamas attacks understandably shattered Israel: President Joe Biden noted that if you adjust for population, the death toll was the equivalent of about 15 Sept. 11 attacks. It’s also true, as my colleague Ezra Klein noted in his podcast, that Gaza has suffered the equivalent of about 400 Sept. 11 attacks.More children have been reported killed in Gaza in the past three weeks than in all global conflicts together in the entirety of last year, Save the Children notes. By the count of the Gaza Health Ministry, which is under the Hamas government but whose figures are roughly accepted by humanitarian agencies and in the past have been used by the State Department, a child has died on average about once every 10 minutes in the war.And the Gaza war is just getting started.I don’t think this is politically sustainable for Israel, or morally sustainable for America as we provide weapons used to kill and maim civilians. Nor do I believe it will be effective at protecting Israel.“To kill terrorist leaders without addressing the despair of their supporters is a fool’s errand and produces more frustration, more despair, and more terrorism,” Ami Ayalon, a former leader of the Shin Bet security agency, wrote in his 2020 memoir.When we see a Doctors Without Borders video of a 9-year-old boy having his foot amputated on a Gaza hospital floor, without adequate anesthesia, as his sister looks and waits for her own surgery, how can we not feel the same revulsion we felt watching Hamas videos of attacks on Israelis?We can’t undo the mutilations and massacres inflicted by Hamas on Israel three weeks ago, but we can avoid maiming and killing Palestinian civilians over the coming months.If the dehumanization I encountered in Israel and the West Bank was profoundly depressing, I was inspired by those on both sides who press for reconciliation and peace. A Palestinian nurse from Jenin, Mohamed Abu Jafar, whose 16-year-old brother was shot dead by Israeli forces on the street in front of his school, is an example.“The conflict will not be resolved in military actions,” he told me. “Because they can’t kill us all, and we can’t kill them all.”The Biden administration says it welcomes a humanitarian pause, and it should push for this more resolutely as an occasion to provide medicine, water and food to civilians while also seeking at least a partial prisoner exchange. It should also ask Israel to refocus its warfare more narrowly on Hamas itself, because every extra bomb that hits civilians digs us deeper into this crater of hatred and will make it more difficult to ever clamber out, look into one another’s eyes and find a path to peace.© 2023 The New York Times CompanyDuring the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

If the Supreme Court ruled for desegregation, “The Moses bill would permit the state, through the localities, to contract with non-profit organizations for operation of the schools. The bill was introduced in an effort to preserve the segregated school system should Virginia’s present system be ruled unconstitutional.”On Feb. 6, King George VI died, Queen Elizabeth, 25 years old, became the first queen of England in 51 years. She was queen until her death in September 2022.Communism was seen everywhere. Hundreds were suspected and accused of being communist. In Germany, the battle between east and west increased throughout the years. In March of 1952, East and West Germany had an electric battle. East Germany cut electricity it was providing to the West, so the West, in response, cut electricity to the East. West Germany claimed the cut caused no shortage and did not set any restrictions.As of July 1, 1952, Hampton became the newest independent city in the area.Advances in technology weren’t all serious. In October, a new style of movie was released. Third-dimension movies were said to be a new projection technique that provided depth to the image. The story claimed, “It will do for the industry what sound did for silent pictures.”A long dry spell hit the east in November, resulting in massive forest fires. The fires burned uncontrolled for three weeks. In total, about 45,000 acres burned, including areas of the Dismal Swamp. This was reported as the worst fire since 1930. It was put out in the end by two solid days of rain.Downtown traffic got a break in March 1953, when Constance Road opened as a bypass to driving through downtown. Within a week, police were reporting issues with drivers not attending to traffic signals, the result of which was several accidents.In the heat of June, science again was the hero as polio inoculations began.On the first day, volunteers handed out lollipops and gamma globulin to 9,216 youngsters.

suffolknewsherald_2023_86,"Published 5:02 pm Tuesday, March 28, 2023ByJen JaquaAlthough the war was over, shortages of numerous items continued, although the shortages were now caused by massive labor strikes nationwide. Some of the companies that experienced massive labor strikes during 1946 and ’47 were Packing House, a meat packing facility, tugboats in New York, telephone workers, electric railway workers, motor coach operators, transport workers, dairy workers, miners, airplane mechanics, railway workers, soup canning factory workers, truckers, Ford Motor plant workers, and pineapple industry workers in Hawaii.Here locally, the Virginia Ferries operators were on strike for a short period. Several attempts were made to allow the state to take over operation of Chesapeake Ferry Company, which ran the ferries between Newport News and Pine Beach and Old Point Comfort and Willoughby Spit. One story about the proposed state running of the ferries claimed them to “constitute a vital part in the integration of our highway system.”One of the main items declared as reason for the strikes was pay. In spring of 1946, an increase in minimum wage was proposed, from 40 cents an hour to 65 cents. It would then be raised to 70 cents by the end of year, and 75 cents in two years. These proposed increases failed to happen. The minimum wage would not go up until 1950.In the aftermath of the war, many Nazis were put on trial for war crimes. The reports from these trials exposed the horrific extent of their inhuman treatment of Jews and prisoners.One such example was published on March 20, 1946, titled “German confesses Nazis killed 2 million Jews.” The story details one of the most prominent war trials held. “The gassing of 2,000,000 Jews and other persons at the Oswiecim horror camp was admitted in a signed statement given to British authorities by Rudolf Hoss, 46-year-old commandant of the camp, who was arrested on March 8. Hoss, who was found hiding out on a farm near Flensburg, signed the confession on March 16, British officials declared. They quoted Hoss’ statement as saying: “I personally arranged, on orders received from Himmler in May 1941, the gassing of 2,000,000 persons between June and July 1941, and the end of 1943 during which I was commandant at Oswiecim.”Rudolf Hoss was executed by hanging on April 16, 1947. He was convicted of sending 4,000,000 persons to death while Nazi commandant of Oswiecim, now better known as Auschwitz-Birkenau, Nazi Germany’s largest concentration and extermination camp.Suffolk Peanut KingAmedeo Obici died May 22, 1947.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_180,"Black Friday was once a hallmark celebration of American consumerism. Lately, it has lost some of its thunder.It’s true that shoppers looking for big discounts can still line up early at Macy’s or Best Buy on the day after Thanksgiving, in hopes of snagging a bargain. But for many, the bargain has already been had.Check your inbox: Those emails offering the “Best Prices of the Year” have been coming in for days or weeks as retailers try to beat one another to your wallet.“When you think about Black Friday, the competitive landscape has really shifted to Black Friday deals prior to Black Friday,” Jeffrey Gennette, CEO of Macy’s, told investors on a recent call as he explained why the company was spreading out its promotions. “We’re in the midst of that along with our competitors.”That’s not to say that Black Friday has lost all meaning. The days when scores of customers camped out at big-box retailers or trampled one another in the rush to get cheap televisions may be gone, but Black Friday is still shorthand for the shopping frenzy that grips Americans this time each year.“It’s still a cultural event, but it’s not what it was some years ago,” said Craig Johnson, founder of retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners. “It’s nothing like it used to be.”The ease of online shopping has also tamped down Black Friday crowds, but some consumers still prefer the in-person experience.At a Best Buy in Durham, North Carolina, a few dozen customers lined up outside the store before dawn Friday. Nitish Michael said he and his wife, Smriti, didn’t want to commit to any big-ticket purchases. Instead, they bought a few discounted Nintendo Switch video games for their 14-year-old son, Aarit.Nandan Namvuri, 31, and Ydalis Guzman, 27, were in the market for a QLED TV that was discounted at least 40%. Namvuri said that he’d found such deals online but that for such an expensive purchase, he wanted to check the pixel resolution himself.Sydney Hladilek, 21, has been going out for Black Friday deals with her mother for more than a decade. This year, they were looking for a flat-screen television.“I personally don’t like shopping online,” Hladilek said. “I’d rather come in person. Plus, it’s a bonding experience.”Here is what you need to know about Black Friday shopping.•••HOW DID BLACK FRIDAY COME TO BE?The term “Black Friday” was coined around the 1960s by Philadelphia police officers. On the day after Thanksgiving and before the annual Army-Navy football game Saturday, tourists would storm retailers in the city, and the crowds would overwhelm law enforcement.Retailers embraced the interest, but the original meaning was lost on many people — who came to understand being in the “black” as a reference to profits at retailers (compared with red, which signifies losses .Over the decades, thanks to retail promotions, it became a fixture on the national calendar — eventually defined by long lines, unruly crowds and occasional casualties. As stores sought to compete for shoppers, they extended their hours — first to the crack of dawn Friday, then to midnight, then to the night of Thanksgiving.That trend, facing a backlash from retail workers, began to reverse a few years ago. Many retailers now make a point of staying closed on Thanksgiving. (Employees at some Macy’s stores in Washington state used Black Friday to make a statement about their working conditions. More than 400 sales associates went on strike over issues they say they’re facing, including theft in stores and low wages. In the past 20 or so years, Black Friday sales have also spread internationally, said Dale Rogers, a business professor at Arizona State University. “It started off as a little American thing,” he said. “Now it’s really global.”•••SALES NOW START LONG BEFORE FRIDAYRetailers slowly introduced sales earlier, and now deals can be found as early as October, Johnson said.“If you’re a retailer, you don’t want to capture demand by dropping your prices so low that you don’t make money,” he said. “The way most people capture demand is by targeting early demand.”Consumers have spent 5% more online in the first 20 days of November than they did in the same period last year, according to Adobe Analytics.Many retailers say that spending on the other end of the holiday shopping calendar, in the days approaching Christmas, is more important as people rush to nab last-minute gifts.Barnes &Noble, for example, sells more than 20 million books in December alone, with the seven days before Christmas accounting for 20 times the sales of an average week. In 2022, Christmas Eve and the Saturday before Christmas were the busiest days for dollar stores, according to Placer.ai, a market research company.Johnson said his firm predicted Black Friday would be the third-busiest day for retailers this year, behind Dec. 23 and Dec. 16, the last two Saturdays before Christmas.•••WHAT ARE RETAILERS SAYING ABOUT HOLIDAY SHOPPING?Companies have spent much of the past year celebrating a surprisingly resilient consumer who has continued to spend despite inflation and rising interest rates.But there are signs that is starting to change. Last quarter, many executives told analysts that shoppers had started pulling back.The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates rapidly starting in March 2022 in an effort to slow down the economy and curb inflation. Though the rate at which prices are rising has eased significantly, the overall increase in prices is starting to weigh on consumers, limiting the amount of discretionary income at their disposal.“Consumers are feeling the weight of multiple economic pressures, and discretionary retail has borne the brunt of this weight for many quarters now,” Christina Hennington, chief growth officer of Target, told analysts on a recent earnings call.That doesn’t necessarily mean consumers won’t turn out, but they are more likely to take advantage of promotions and less likely to make big purchases like furniture or certain electronics, analysts expect.Corie Barry, CEO of Best Buy, told analysts on an earnings call Tuesday that the company was “preparing for a customer who is very deal-focused” and was expecting sales to concentrate on days such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the days just before Christmas.The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecasts that holiday sales will increase 3% to 4% from last year, which is in line with pre-pandemic levels but not as high as the past two years. Holiday sales rose 5.3% in 2022 and 12.7% in 2021.Some stores offered creative deals to draw customers in — or outside — the door.At a Durham location of Swish, a shoe seller based in North Carolina, customers who lined up by 7 a.m. Friday were entered into a raffle to get certain deals.Gary Johnson, 44, was among the 14 customers whose names were drawn. He decided to buy a pair of Yeezy Slides, which sold for $70. The original price was advertised as $200 at the store, though they were available online for around $90. Johnson was aware of the online discounts but said he relished the “experience” of waiting outside.”“Just standing in line is a childhood memory,” he said, recalling the times he waited for discounted video games.At a J.C. Penney down the road, customers snatched up “mystery coupons” that were valued at anywhere from $25 to $500 at checkout, starting at 5 a.m. At a Palmetto Moon, a Charleston, South Carolina-based clothing company, eager shoppers camped outside to be among the first 50 people in the door and receive a $25 gift card.© 2023 The New York Times Company"

No idle coincidence, the wolverine is the symbol of the University of Michigan’s football team.Recently, in the world of college football, a scandal of unprecedented magnitude has erupted. It was discovered that one of the staff of Coach Jim Harbaugh’s team had been spying on other football teams by stealing signals of opponent teams.This devious activity had encompassed several seasons. The advantage to the Michigan team was significant. Coach Harbaugh remained guarded and mute regarding the initial inquiry.The red-faced irony of this scenario in the context of “rah, rah” teamwork, makes turfing and scapegoating the violation of game rules to a single staff member wildly indefensible and inadmissible!Coach Harbaugh luxuriates in a $10 million salary and national notoriety. Michigan is currently relishing the pinnacle among NCAA football teams.History recites dictator Julias Caesar as aggressive and popular.

suffolknewsherald_2023_141,"Published 4:58 pm Tuesday, January 31, 2023ByStaff ReportsIt had been a rough evening. Timothy was upset when I had him turn off a video game to complete his homework, he didn’t like anything made for dinner, and our discussion about his chores for the week had not gone smoothly.There were some additional discussions that I wanted to take place, but the day was ending. We didn’t have much time before the lights would go out for the night. I wanted to speak about everything we needed to talk about, but I resisted bringing up the events of the day. We talked about whatever crossed his mind as he wrapped up the day, and I laughed at one of his jokes. Timothy crawled into bed, I said our evening prayers, wished him a good night’s sleep and turned out the lights.The final portion of the day and the last few conversations before bed will stay in children’s minds as they drift off to sleep. The atmosphere and interactions during the last part of the day can make a big difference in their perception of the entire day. Therefore, it’s important to do all we can to end the day on a positive note. We should aim for children to feel safe, loved and filled with positivity as they quiet their minds for a night’s sleep.We can help create this atmosphere by choosing our words carefully and purposefully discussing positive or fun things as the day draws to a close. Allowing children to discuss what is on their minds can help them to end the day on the best note possible. Likewise, we should not wait until the end of the day to bring up things that need to be discussed. Do what you can to correct or discipline poor behavior before the last half hour of the day, and do not plan to have difficult conversations at bedtime.Trying not to end the day on a bad note doesn’t mean that bad behavior should be ignored because it’s nearing bedtime. There may be times when discipline or correction is needed later in the evening, but adults should be doing what they can to help the last portion of the day be positive.Planning when things are done in the evening can help prevent things from ending on a sour note. For example: If you know that a particular item, such as homework, may create a problem, ensure that homework is completed with enough time to do something else before bed.Ensuring that children have done what is needed for the day and allowing them some time to unwind and relax before the end of the day can help everyone. Ask about chores, homework, and other tasks and verify they are done before it’s time for bed. Waiting until the last minute increases the chance that the last part of the day will be unpleasant.The final minutes of a day can help a bad day to not seem so bad, but it can also make a good day not seem so good.

eugeneweekly_2023_3,"We ve got issues. An ongoing Russia/Ukraine War, a recently begun Israel/Gaza War, another mass shooting in Maine, American democracy being eroded, it has not been “the best of times.” I often wonder, how do we raise ourselves out of the pit of despair? What can one person possibly do to help alleviate all the suffering that surrounds us? What gives me hope is looking at some of those unknown, everyday individuals right here in our community of Eugene, Oregon, who are touching others and living a loving, compassionate life. Vickie is a neighbor and a friend. She lives in a parking lot in one of ShelterCare’s conestoga huts. Due to health and dire circumstances, Vickie is familiar with homelessness and considers herself fortunate to have her “small home.” I am inspired every time I visit her. She lives a simple life with her main motto being “happy, healthy!” About a year ago Vickie and some friends started a very small nonprofit called “Helping Homeless.” Over this past year they collected money to create small kits of sanitary and personal items for those living on the street. Just a few months ago, they gathered volunteers and created several hundred of these kits which they distributed to Lane County homeless residents. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Jerry, an old friend from decades ago, rides his bicycle rain or shine daily past my house loaded down with bags of recyclable cans and bottles. Since his retirement as a city bus driver, he has been gathering these items and giving the money to charity. When I last spoke with Jerry, he had added taking appropriate jars to several businesses and grocery stores. He told me he spends a good amount of time thoroughly washing each glass container. He has definitely become a recycle and reuse machine! Dear friends and decades-long social and political activists, Sue Barnhart and Michael Carrigan, took their despair over our many world wide wars and created their organization Planet vs Pentagon. Currently, they have an ongoing 5 pm Wednesday Peace Vigil at the Old Federal Building (711 E. 7th Avenue. for an “immediate Middle East ceasefire.” They and others wishing to join them plan to stand with their signs and waving hands until the ceasefire is reached. Michael is a former decades-long Community Alliance of Lane County community organizer, and Sue is currently the primary organizer, with the help of other volunteers, of Oregon Community Asylum Network (OCAN . OCAN was started by one person, Abby Gershenzon, who, having been a volunteer at the California/Mexican border, witnessed the anguish and poor treatment of asylum seekers legally trying to seek refuge in our country. As a sponsor myself of two Salvadoran asylum seekers, I have watched this organization grow from bringing only a handful of refugees to Eugene to now more than 35 refugees establishing their safer lives here. It can be extremely difficult to have hope in a world of despair. But these individual people I have described are only a few of the compassionate souls in our small city, and there are so many more in every other city on our planet. I do not believe it is being pollyannaish to believe that each living human being can make a difference. A kind and grateful word to postal workers, grocery clerks, restaurant servers, etc. can make that person’s day! “If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain; If I can ease one life the aching, Or cool one pain, Or help one fainting robin Unto his nest again, I shall not live in vain.” —Emily Dickinson What hopeful actions will you do?

eugeneweekly_2023_63,"We ve got issues. There is a quiet recovery-oriented revolution happening in Lane County and across the state after the announcement of the Measure 110 grants for substance use disorders reduction services last September. In just a few short months, people on the ground have gotten to work optimizing the $29 million awarded to Lane County providers. This is an incredible amount of new funding — statewide, five times more than has ever been allotted to help individuals and families struggling with substance use disorder. Meanwhile, Gov. Tina Kotek has put in new leadership at the Oregon Health Authority and will be pushing to ensure that there are no more delays in future funding. Now with funding awarded, Measure 110 is doing exactly what the voters called on it to do: Take a public health approach to addiction and fund the services that will help keep individuals and communities safe. Oregon, like many states in the country, is facing an overdose crisis. Unlike other states, thanks to Measure 110, we have the money and the smartest approach to do something about it. Here’s what that looks like in Lane County: We now have a connected group of 18 providers who will work to give wraparound services to people no matter who they are, what their housing situation is or where they are on their journey to health. Together we will provide screening, intervention, treatment, overdose prevention, housing and employment services in a new county-wide Behavioral Health Resource Network. The right services at the right time in the right way. Our organization, Centro Latino Americano, serves Latinx and immigrant families in Lane County. We support the community by creating a safe space that fosters leadership, education, wellness and community connection. We are already using Measure 110 dollars to increase staff, services and outreach to people struggling with substance use. Now, we are able to serve more people than ever before, creating a safe space where clients feel welcome and understood because they are receiving compassionate support from someone who understands their heritage and language. This is what people need to build a strong foundation for their recovery. That’s what Measure 110 is helping make possible for even more people in our community. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. These are exactly the kinds of services voters wanted when they passed Measure 110. They were — and still are — fed up with the expensive and ineffective approach of locking people up for private possession of small amounts of drugs, because they knew the approach didn’t work. It cost too much, destroyed too many lives and did not make our communities safer. Voter support for Measure 110 remains steadfast. Not only did the voters largely reject candidates last November who called for repealing the measure, independent polling of over 1,000 representative voters showed that their support continues. Seventy-two percent of voters statewide say drug use and addiction services should be addressed through a public health, not a criminal, approach. Additionally, a majority of Oregonians say that Measure 110 should not be repealed. Voters know that rolling back Measure 110 will put us right back where we were in 2019, when people of means got the treatment they needed without criminal records, while poor people, Black people and homeless people caught with small amounts for private, personal use faced arrest and prosecution, lost their jobs, their kids and their right to be fully productive members of our community. Change will not happen overnight. Providers are getting programs up and running, and word will get out that services are finally available. Step by step, conversation by conversation, service by service, we will make a real difference in our communities. This is a time of great hope and optimism. We are celebrating that 2023 is going to look dramatically different than years past for everyone in Oregon who will finally get the help they need and they deserve. If you or anyone you love needs help, please call 541-575-3769 to get connected to local assistance. Basilio Sandoval is the substance use disorders program manager at Centro Latino Americano, a Lane County community organization working to empower Latino families, provide opportunities and generate connections to strengthen the Latino community."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_179,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°New Yorkers were shocked and appalled when some social media personalities rediscovered a 2002 “Letter to America” in which Osama Bin Laden, dripping with antisemitism, criticized U.S. foreign policy, suggesting it painted a more compelling picture of the terrorist. While the rehabilitation of the dead jihadist behind 9/11 may have been overstated, the Guardian, which had hosted a version of the letter, pulled it from its site.We’ve defended the principles of free speech many times here, including several in the past several weeks as some institutions have turned towards speech restrictionism in response to widespread public discourse and high tensions in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel and its subsequent military response.It is crucial to note, though, that this isn’t a principle for its own sake. There is a practical purpose to having robust public discussion, in particular around contentious social and political topics and including unpopular or controversial ideas. Exposure to ideas, even bad ones, is the only way for people, especially young people, to develop antibodies against extremism. We should know by now that little is as enticing as the forbidden; to hide ideas is to all but beg those casting about for political identity to ask “what are they trying to hide?”Stalin, Hitler and Mao are all worthy of study, as is another blood-soaked fiend, Bin Laden. To the ignorant and ahistorical who do their scholarly research on TikTok, some of these monsters’ rhetoric may sound intriguing. But what is needed is education to what they really stood for and what they really did. Shutting down access is a great way to generate sympathy and additional cachet for seemingly forbidden ideas.We can practically guarantee that scrubbing the Bin Laden letter from the Guardian’s site has just driven more people to go looking for it, perhaps in places where there won’t be quite as much contextualization or where it’ll be an entrypoint to more dangerous calls to action.This is in no way an entreaty to reevaluate Bin Laden nor a call to disseminate his letter. Any ideas the man might have are but a footnote to his campaign of murder and terrorism — a campaign led, by the way, by a former billionaire business school student who chose to reinvent himself as a revolutionary.It’s not a call for all speech to be tolerated everywhere; it makes sense to have some social media moderation of harmful medical misinformation around vaccines and eating disorders, for example, and no institution, university or otherwise, should tolerate members calling for violence against or harassment of others.We are pointing out that efforts to hide what is ultimately a historically significant document, or to tamp down on expressions of political opinion, are not only anti-democratic but most often backfire. Students who have valid criticisms of Israel’s policies and the country’s military campaign against Hamas are not going to soften their stance by having their campus groups banned and job prospects threatened; they’ll turn towards extreme versions of those positions.Young people must be able to read and discuss disputed or outright bad ideas without risking their futures.

leoweekly_2023_65,"In just a few hours,Kentucky Gubernatorial GOPcandidates will take the stage at The Henry Clay for a debate to be televised on Spectrum News 1 this evening from 7-8 p.m.The GOP debate is welcoming media and ticketed invitees, and offering five-minute interviews with media, and a meet-and-greet with the 200+ attendees following the debate.However, from the tone of the media invite, no one will be in the same room with candidates during the debate. The media and attendees will watch from a different room, the second-floor ballroom, via large screens. The only photographer will be from the Associated Press, and no livestreaming will be allowed. There are more rules, but here’s the thing: this debate is the epitome of an ironic horse pile of a mess, and to be honest, it’s blatantly offensive to those in the LGBTQ community and anyone who cares about their friends and family members who are part of that community.The GOP, the party who has been actively working on bills across the country like Kentucky’s HB 470, which would essentially ban gender-affirming care to transgender youth, or SB 115, which puts the performance of drag in certain places at risk, is hosting their debate atThe Henry Clay.Why is this noteworthy?The Henry Clay has a long history for Louisville’s LGBTQ scene. It once housed theBeaux Arts Cocktail Lounge, which was a meeting place for local gay men and those who stayed at the hotel. The Beaux Arts was in operation from 1947 until 1955. It was, from many accounts, an openly “gay” bar billing itself as “the gay Beaux Arts” in advertisements and offering patrons “music and gayety.”Beyond the time of the Beaux Arts Lounge, The Henry Clay has been at the heart of the theater district in Louisville. This theater district has hosted and still hosts plays, ballets, and other performance arts that are geared toward and celebrate the queer community. The Henry Clay, in particular, has served as home to several LGBTQ-oriented theater groups. One of those is currentlyPandora Productions, whose Godspell show opens this week.The idea that the GOP is hosting their debate in a theater, in a building that has been home to the Louisville LGBTQ community is, in so many ways, mind-blowing. The inability of Republicans to read a room and not look like ridiculous fools is wild. This may not be the time or the place to bring the hate of the “Grand Ol’ Party” to a community fighting for its very survival.The Henry Clay still maintains a ballroom on its fourth floor called the Beaux Arts Ballroom, a nod to its queer history.So, the Kentucky GOP, who actively harms and espouses hate upon the LGBTQ community, is hosting their “shindig” in the house that gays built — to put it mildly.Will the moderators ask them about these bills? Will they be pressed to explain why they chose The Henry Clay over the many more GOP-friendly spaces in the city? I mean, doesn’t Southeast Christian have a big auditorium?Here’s what’s good. The sidewalk outside the Henry Clay is wide, and should a protest pop up, there is plenty of space and parking nearby.*** ."
suffolknewsherald_2023_116,"Published 5:18 pm Tuesday, February 21, 2023ByStaff ReportsTis a time in history, when communities across this great nation of America can harvest the true potential of sovereignty; for which is the organic essence of Liberty that was sealed upon this nation during the American revolution of 1776, when we separated from the royal crown of England and broke away from the Vatican. This notion was flexed, yet again, with the eradication of the slave trade. The gateway of revolution is close to all the hearts of Americans and is the true demonstration of the power structure of our country, known asWe The People. We the people live in diverse environments but with that being said, we also depend upon each other for a lot. That is what makes us a community. Revolutions are diverse in nature and are not destined to be adequate. They lead to freedom in ways never seen but they are not proper by any means. But when the blind leadeth the blind, we must know when to act and how.For far too long, we Americans have lived in the glory of our wrong doings as a nation and that is something that we must forgive each other for and remember we are all in this exodus together. The ragged old flag has its stains but it still fly’s high in the land of milk and honey; and we are still in the land of the free; and we are still blessed among measures. We are not a part of any monarch; we are not a part of any world order; and we are not a slave to principalities. However, we are being divided and destroyed from within. There are people among us who do not care for the survival of this country. There are officials within all Departments of the Federal government who do not care about the security of our state, but would rather see a global civilization, known to many as a new world order, triumph the natural order of tribal constituency.For far too long, we have allowed usurpation by the elites and the Federal government to inflict psyops upon our human dignity. We all know that the Federal government is supposed to work for us and not against us, but it seems that no matter who we elect, they always seem to never follow the path that got them elected in the first place; but yet, they take more freedom away from the people; that is no conspiracy. So, what do we do? We must gather our commitments and focus our energy at bettering our community by respecting the unalienable rights of all; for which is theLaws of Nature,spoken about in the Declaration of Independence. Lastly, we must never forget the path to the true essence of revolution, which is our upper hand asWe The People. The path to justice is divinely represented, in a contextual fashion, throughout theDeclaration of Independence; specifically addressed when Thomas Jefferson, inspired by Patrick Henry’sVirginia’s Declaration of Rights, said this; “But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new guards for their future security”.We have an obligation to protect our family and communities by instilling integrity into the lives of our children. This will solidify the proper change that can take on the tyrannical order imposing upon the sovereignty of America. There is a greater order above man that is divine and justful; it would be prudent to heed to it. We must be wise as serpents but gentle as doves.

suffolknewsherald_2023_28,"Published 3:10 pm Friday, June 9, 2023ByStaff ReportsJ R.R. Tolkien, author of “The Lord of the Rings,” “The Hobbit” and other books first caught my attention when I happened to see a picture of him in the room where he was still writing, shortly before his death.There was so much clutter only his picture and his typewriter were clearly seen. This, from the pen of a writer whose imagination was incredible-incomparable, and almost incomprehensible as he wrote his fascinating fiction stories, I looked around my own computer room of wasted papers.Reading and writing, once supremely important, are today being shortened by texting. All who text know how the message can be confusing. Writers need clear thinking so the reader gets the clear message. Tolkien’s was clear and delightful.He was working on his next book, Silmarillion, when he passed away. One quote from that time interests me: “Healing comes only by suffering and patience, and makes no demand, not even for justice.”What did he mean by that? I thought It seemed to have a biblical message for many of my ideas.In that same old group of papers, I found one of my own which still has relevance, “Who or What is a Woman?” I began it with: “Call me anything you want to, just remember I am a woman, a unique creation of God, with a place only a woman can fulfill.” The Bible has much to tell us about this human creation which is sometimes misunderstood today.God had first created a man, Adam. Creating him sounded simple, easy; it took only a handful of dust (Genesis 2:7 . He gave to Adam some of His own qualities, and major responsibilities. Adam knew about the animals, but the woman God planned for him had to be different.For this companion, the Creator took time to design the woman. Her body shape and almost everything about her is different from a man’s.Imagination helps us when we read the story in Genesis. She had to be beautiful to appeal to the man. The upper part of her body was made to expand when she needed to nurse the child God planned for her. Her hip shape was different. A very tiny part below and inside her waist can expand and become a “baby holder.” Her ears will be alert to hear the baby’s cry, even in the night, her arms made strong to hold her baby while stirring the dinner, her smaller feet able to run quickly when there is a “baby’s emergency.”When the birthing time of suffering is over, the wonders and joys of holding the newborn and the privilege of motherhood will follow. There will be healing before she goes through the experience again. Waiting for the birth adds a degree of patience. Holding the newborn brings acceptance and great joy.The life of the man will be different. It may not seem like justice when men do not have to experience those pains and suffering, but males will have the major responsibility to see that family needs are met.So what else in the Bible alerts us to “Who or What is a woman?” The Bible concordance has about 567 references to women, of which at least 167 are named. They occupied positions as wife, mother, daughter, daughter in law, grandmother, sister, other relative, song leader, prophetess, harlot, judge, temple worker, witch, queen, homemaker, deaconess and future world leader (in Revelation. I may not be able to interpret Tolkien’s meaning, but reading the quote helped expand my thinking about God’s creative powers. A woman is indeed a unique creation of God, not a man like Adam.We delight in showing off what has changed almost everything in our lives and homes, the birth of a baby. We mothers have been given the responsibility of raising daughters and sons who will be strong and loving and work hard to care for their families.Tolkien’s words may remain an unfinished part of his writing but somehow they have remained embedded in my thoughts. That’s what reading and writing does to us. His words make us think, something we all need to do as we face this “new world” of today’s changes.Myrtle V. Thompson, age 95, is a Suffolk writer and author with books on Amazon.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

eugeneweekly_2023_34,"We ve got issues. PeaceHealth claims to see us. Yet all it sees is a profit-driven approach that often neglects patients and the very caregivers delivering care. Our patients deserve better. We deserve better. As a dedicated respiratory therapist at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart, I have tirelessly served this institution and our community for 17 years. During my commitment, I’ve witnessed the growing disconnect between PeaceHealth’s mission and its behavior. Corporate greed now overshadows the well-being of both patients and health care professionals — the very professionals who make quality care possible. As a respiratory therapist I provide critical care support for our youngest pediatric patients all the way through adulthood. We are an essential element of the critical care team, ensuring that patients receive the respiratory care they need to survive and recover. The tech unit, of which I am a part, includes a variety of critical care services that support newborns in the NICU, patients in the ICU, cardiac cath lab, stroke center, trauma care and beyond. These services are indispensable to our community. Without us, the hospital simply cannot run. While we are seeing PeaceHealth’s profit-oriented behavior in its unwillingness to produce an agreeable and timely union contract, its actions are indicative of a deeper problem within the institution. This problem is a prioritization of corporate interests over patient care and staff well-being, a practice that is sadly becoming all too common in the healthcare industry. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Patients should be at the forefront of our mission, and it’s disheartening to see the future of their care compromised for the sake of profits. The most alarming example of PeaceHealth’s actions are seemingly reckless cuts to patient services, including the closure of the University District hospital, while CEOs continue to receive extravagant raises. It’s a stark contrast that highlights the institution’s skewed priorities. Techs deserve better, and so does our community. We are fighting for you, our patients, advocating for your right to receive the quality care you deserve. It’s time for PeaceHealth to prioritize and value the community that depends on it over its greed. This starts by placing an immediate priority on respecting techs, like myself, who are critical to the hospital’s mission. Management must immediately refocus its attention on offering living wages and taking measures to recruit, retain and respect its staff. As respiratory therapists, alongside the rest of the tech unit, we provide life-saving care and play a vital role in service to our community. It’s time for PeaceHealth to re-evaluate its priorities and recommit to their own core principles. This entails placing patients first and valuing the dedicated professionals who make quality care possible. A call for PeaceHealth to return to its once closely held mission is being voiced from the caregivers who are committed to upholding this truth, as it is the very cornerstone of caregiving. It is time to rediscover the very ethos of the “healing and compassionate ministry and service of Jesus Christ, relieving suffering and treating each person with loving care,” which PeaceHealth claims as its guiding principle. Our community depends on this, and our patients deserve nothing less."

leoweekly_2023_32,"Areader of LEO online recently suggested that the cover artists of our Pride issue should keep their sexuality to themselves and return to the closet. I wasn’t surprised by the comment, there are a few homophobes who troll LEO’s pages but I wanted to make sure this was crystal clear to this reader and all others who come to LEO’s pages: We fully and unequivocally support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community, and won’t tolerate any suggestion that someone should return to a closet.The idea that in 2023, we have to say it so explicitly, and that anyone would feel cozy on LEO’s pages to suggest something of the sort, is frustrating. We shouldn’t need to tell people that LEO is queer-friendly. It would seem obvious.Either way, it needed to be said.We’re moving through a period in this nation where a lot of the ugly parts of discrimination are raging against the dying of the light and creating dangerous situations for people in the LGBTQ+ community. These people are actively harming their friends, neighbors, and family members under the cloak of Christian conservatism. There is nothing less Christian than seeking to harm people simply because of a lack of understanding or a blatant lack of basic human compassion. Conservatism as a cover for prudishness and fear is equally as ridiculous.As a human species, we’re all moving dangerously close to ultimate harm by not caring for our planet, but as we care less for each other, we expedite our downfalls.When I encounter homophobia, in particular, I’m baffled about how this continues to be a thing. I’m equally confused about how racists continue to justify yelling the ‘N-word’ from the window of a car while riding by a group of Black people. Prejudice, in terms of exclusion and most -isms, is baffling because it has no practical use but harm.I don’t really have anywhere that I’m going with this note other than to clarify that LEO is a space that is open to all. If that openness makes you uncomfortable as a reader of our publication, that’s unfortunate. Each member of our city adds flavor and color to the landscape and while I wish that we could all care for each other and see that protecting everyone is important, I am not naive. I know that, for some, to see those who are different as equal to them or precious as God’s creations (should they claim to be Christian , is just asking too much.I’m also not going to ask people to be better. What I will say to the people who are being harmed by prejudice whether that is homophobia, racism, sexism, ageism, etc., is that you have value and there is no need to defend your humanity against those who can’t see it. Take up space and be you in all places. Your existence is defense enough. You don’t need to justify yourself to them and LEO will always welcome you with open arms as long as we can.•*** ."

Don’t waste time; get out and vote now. If you have yet to study your candidates, there is still time to do so, although the voting cycle will conclude just as quickly as it began.In Suffolk, on a state level, House District 84 and 89 and Senate District 17 are on the ballot this time around. Locally, the Soil and Conservation Director for the Peanut District is also up for election.Typically, elections that do not include the President tend to have a lower turnout, which is unfortunate as these seats dramatically impact our daily lives more than our national elections. Don’t mistake what we are saying here; national seats impact us, but the decisions that shape our daily routines, finances, and way of life are decided at the local and state levels.Registering to vote is the first step to having your voice heard, and in Virginia, the last day to register is Monday, Oct. 16, so if you still need to register, please do so now.With the massive amount of transient families in and around Suffolk, absentee ballots are also available, and the last day to apply for an absentee ballot by mail is Friday, Oct. 27.Something relatively new to hit the election calendar is Saturday voting, which takes place on Saturday, Oct. 28, in Suffolk, and, of course, the last day to vote is Tuesday, Nov. 7.By then, we hope most will have already cast a vote, and in-person lines will be short.With as much time allotted to cast ballots, there is no excuse for the nearly 65,000 active voters in Suffolk not to hit the polls.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_53,"Published 5:21 pm Friday, May 5, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardIn recent months, the Virginia Reliability Project has drawn criticism and concerns from groups opposed to Columbia Gas Transmission’s proposed natural gas line that will run through the region.A 48-mile expansion project proposed by Columbia Gas Transmission LLC, a subsidiary of Canada-based TC Energy unaffiliated with Columbia Gas of Virginia, VRP is proposed to bring a new gas pipeline routed through the Hampton Roads and Southeast areas of Virginia, including the cities of Suffolk and Chesapeake, as well as Isle of Wight and Southampton counties.The VRP website says it is “an expansion and reliability project that would replace two existing segments of the TCO pipeline system to continue reliable and abundant natural gas supply.”Opponents raise concerns about the project’s environmental effects, its proximity to homes and schools in Suffolk and other communities and the hazards it could pose.One of the key points that catches our attention is Chesapeake Climate Action Network Hampton Roads organizer Charles Brown II’s findings that many in Suffolk know little or nothing aboutVRP.“We’ve been doing a lot of outreach in the Hillpoint community of Suffolk,” he said. “As we’re knocking on doors to inform residents of the project, what we’re seeing time and time again is that a lot of them, don’t even know still, that it’s even being proposed.”We agree with his assertion that everyone in areas where the transmission line is proposed to go should both be aware of the project and have a chance to review all the facts and do their own research.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Wednesday, April 26 public hearing on the project’s Draft Environmental Impact Statement did allow people a chance to comment. But how can local residents do this if they don’t even know about the VRP plan.With FERC’s public comment period continuing through June 5, we believe there is a need for the Columbia Gas of Virginia to provide more information to Suffolk residents. A company-hosted forum on VRP would be a great start.The VRP website, tcenergy.com/operations/natural-gas/virginia-reliability-project, has the details and the benefits the company says the new line will bring to the region. But it would be great to provide residents the opportunity to ask questions and have their concerns addressed.The website includes data sheets on each community. Suffolk’s page says VRP would provide about 854 new jobs, $49.8 million in associated labor income, $133.2 million in economic output, $1.8 million in one-time local tax revenue from construction and $1.1 million in ongoing annual net new local tax revenuefrom property tax.Opponents believe an informed public will reach conclusions similar to theirs.“We feel like just getting the information, they’ll understand that this is a dangerous project that can affect communities, students, schools, the Great Dismal Swamp, the veteran’s cemetery in Suffolk, Nansemond tribe,” Brown said. “And we don’t want it to happen.”While a public forum or a mailing is a good idea, it’s likely the public will have to do its own research. We urge residents to at least go online and learn more. Then you can have the chance to share your views with the FERC (www.ferc.gov before the comment period ends.In the end, when a decision is made on the VRP proposal, it is best that all residents have a chance to voice their opinion with complete knowledge about the project in hand.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2023_11,"With global violence, polarizing opinions, and a divisive presidential election on the horizon, here s a game plan if you know there will be conflict served up with the mashed potatoes and gravy. Recently, I was in a hospital waiting room as our family prepared for the birth of our first grandchild. On the screen was a constant stream of images from the Israel-Hamas war, theongoing conflict in Ukraine, along withprotests domestically and abroad. It made me pause to consider: What kind of world we were bringing a child into when all we can see is death and destruction? Now that we’re coming up on that time of year when thousands of Philadelphians will find ourselves around holiday dinner tables celebrating the season, I’m asking myself another version of that same question: How can we gather for the feast amidst so much suffering? While the food is clearly the centerpiece of these settings, we’ll do more than just eat. We’ll talk, often with people we haven’t seen for a long time, with whom we may or may not see eye to eye. Many memories are formed around arguments and feuds that have darkened otherwise joyous times with friends and family. With violence raging throughout the world, polarizing opinions, and a divisive presidential election on the horizon, it might be prudent to form a game plan if you know there will be conflict served up with the mashed potatoes and gravy this year. As a professor of communication (and a pastor to boot , I am blessed to routinely have conversations with internationally renowned experts in things like intercultural communication and conflict resolution. I also have had the privilege of sharing dialogues with students from every ideological stripe — politically, ethnically, culturally, and philosophically. In all of these exchanges, they’re more than just casual conversations. We talk about what we believe, what gets us fired up, and how something makes us feel. These conversations often represent the essence of who we are. Many of us have very strong feelings about what’s happening in the world around us. Consider the human tragedieswe’re witnessing in Israel and Gazawhile seeing antisemitic and anti-Arab attacks here at home. Add the ever-present volatility of politics, racial tensions, andus-vs.-them mentality, and you have the ingredients for volcanic interactions that can blow up any carefully curated gathering. But we need not enter the season spoiling for a fight. Instead, this can be a time of understanding and bridge-building, if we proceed with the intention of making it so. With that in mind, here’s a simple recipe that can help turn arguments into more productive interactions: To stir the pot, or not.If you know you’ll be with folks who like turning up your heat, decide if you want to engage, how to engage, and even whether you want to turn the banquet table into a battlefield. These holiday dinners are already fraught with pressures that need not be aggravated by discord. If you’re hosting, set a few ground rules for the table (maybe, no talk of politics . If you’re a guest, set rules for yourself (as in: When my uncle tries to press my buttons, say I need to make a call and walk away . Time we spend with people we care about is too precious to waste in conflict with one another. Be curious, not confrontational.If you honestly want to learn someone else’s point of view, approach it by asking questions that tease out more. The adage “seeking to understand to be understood” is a good guiding principle to follow. You don’t have to agree with them, but understanding where someone else stands can help refine where you sit with your own position. Try to relate, not recruit.There’s always common ground, if we’re patient and skilled enough to seek and find it. Treat all with respect.Let’s be clear on why we’re at the table in the first place. It’s not just to sow seeds of conflict and confrontation, so how productive could it be when we allow dialogue to deteriorate into insults, fistfights, and violence? Never forget the humanity in those with whom we share common space, whether it’s across the table or across imaginary borders that span the globe. Even if you disagree with someone, you should always treat them with respect. It’s hard to be joyful — such as at Thanksgiving, or the birth of a beloved grandchild — when surrounded by images of death and destruction. Thankfully, the picture we see need not be the future we create. With a healthy dose of hope, we can set a place that feels like a genuine invitation framed by a single word:welcome. David W.

leoweekly_2023_49,"We like it when you talk to us, even if you’re upset. This space is for you. Sometimes, we talk back.Married priestsI listened to a “news” story on WDRB that Pope Francis is entertaining the idea of MARRIED priests. I always find it interesting that the Church denies the married priests already in their midst.Though their relationships are not recognized by the Church, alongside many a successful minister is a successful and healthy partnership/relationship with another person. I was one of those partners.My husband and I met each other through ministry. We grew together as mentors, teachers, and partners over eight years until a time when we no longer wished to keep unspoken our love for one another.We were not as covert as we wanted to believe. Friends, family and the people of God recognized the energy we brought to our respective ministries—especially when we worked together teaching music in Catholic worship to parish ministers, composed music and ministered at liturgy.In my opinion, we were as married as two partners could be before and after we legally tied the knot. Following his leaving priesthood, we chose not to go through the process of leicization. This formality would put my husband in the position of saying that his years as a priest were a lie. Therefore, the Church denied us to be married in the Church. In its eyes, our legal union was not valid and therefore we lived in sin.As far as we were concerned, the 500 people of God who attended our celebration were witnesses to our vows to one another. From that day forward, we continued to minister as parish musicians (only a few parishes welcomed us , and as advocates for the vulnerable and those with no voice including “orphaned elderly,” blind and visually impaired adults and children, lgbtq+ community, immigrant families, individuals and families impacted by suicide, and more.So, the Pontiff can talk about “allowing” married priests in the future and priests can talk about the sacredness of celibacy, but I can tell you there are very good priests today who live within that vow and some damn good ones presiding outside that vow in partnership with another person.Not every minister should be married. If celibacy makes you a better minister—go for it. But it’s time the Church stop teaching the People of God that partnered ministry is a sin. It’s time the Church acknowledged these valued ministers as well so they can continue to do the amazing work they do without condemnation.— AnonymousAgreed.Remember to send Letters to the Editor or Soapbox submissions toleo@leoweekly.com ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_155,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°‘Obligation’ to curb greenhouse gases‘Obligation’ to curb greenhouse gasesThe atmosphere of Earth is a layer of gases retained by gravity that surrounds our planet. The majority of the total mass of our atmosphere is located in the lower six miles. By volume, the Earth’s atmosphere is about 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, and 0.93% argon.A brew of trace gases accounts for the remaining 0.04%, including the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane. Carbon dioxide and methane are called greenhouse gases because they act like glass on a greenhouse, letting energy in from the sun but also blocking heat from escaping back into space.Throughout Earth’s history, the amounts of these gases have varied. As greenhouse gases increased, the Earth’s average temperature increased. As greenhouse gases decreased, the Earth’s temperature decreased.Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas. For the last 800,000 years, the amount of carbon dioxide has ranged from about 180 parts per million (ppm to 280 ppm. These changes took place over thousands of years. For the last 10,000 years, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has averaged around 270 ppm. The temperatures of the Earth during this period of time facilitated the development of the human race and our world as we know it.Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, when mankind started burning carbon dioxide polluting coal, oil and gas, the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has risen very rapidly. By 1911, carbon dioxide had increased to 300 ppm. Today it has reached 420 ppm, an increase of 40% in a little more than 110 years, and a 50% increase over preindustrial levels. We are currently at the same level of carbon dioxide as 4 million years ago, when the average temperatures were 5 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer.Methane is the second-most prevalent greenhouse gas and is responsible for a quarter of the warming that we are experiencing today. It is emitted during the production and transport of coal, oil and ‘natural’ gas, which is 80% methane. Methane emissions also result from livestock, particularly cattle, agricultural practices, land use and by the decay of organic waste in municipal landfills. The concentration of methane in our atmosphere has increased 250% over preindustrial levels.Overall, fossil fuels are responsible for more than 75% of the world’s greenhouse emissions, according to the International Panel on Climate Change. Research has shown that reducing methane pollution from the oil and gas industry is the single fastest, most cost-effective way to slow the rate of warming.So far, Earth’s average temperature has only risen 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880. This is primarily due to our oceans, which cover two thirds of the planet, acting like a giant heat sink and absorbing much of the excess heat. From this 2-degree increase we have seen melting ice caps, droughts, increase in severe storms and wildfires, and record-breaking high temperatures around the globe. Imagine what our world will be like with a 5-degree increase.As the country that led the industrial revolution on the back of burning carbon dioxide-polluting fossil fuels, we have a moral obligation to lead the world in a rapid transition to clean energy sources and significantly reducing methane emissions. We have the technology and the ability to do this.The question is: Do we have the will?To learn more about how our world is warming and actions that need to be taken to stop it, visit NASA’s website on climate at climate.nasa.govRon SadlerHiloPaper should stop usage of ‘elderly’Stop using ageist language.You would never use racist or sexist language to describe a person, so why do you use ageist language?

suffolknewsherald_2023_244,"Published 5:14 pm Friday, July 14, 2023ByStaff Reports“So teach us to number our days so that we may gain a heart of wisdom.” Psalm 90:12At one time in history, writing took the form of characters like these:*This is for today’s world (In the mid-1930s, grade one, day one, I began to learn the Locker System of handwriting. We did exercises to help us form the letters correctly, ergo, I never learned to print. Years later as a teacher I found few students who were able to do handwriting.Now the computer age and social media and texting have almost eliminated writing by hand. Tomorrow’s communication system may yet make another change. Our evolving world could someday have another form for communication, such as AI or ASI, or something else might become a trend. We do not know what tomorrow holds for us.Shortly after I began using the computer, I journaled my thoughts this way:“From wintering skies rises late the sun and earth’s darkness quickly disappears. The first rays break through and overcome the night. Another day is dawning. It will have the same hours, the same minutes, and for many of us, the same activities. For others, there will be change. For both, the moments will pass quickly or slowly as we gain new information, listen for new sounds, for new ideas that demand planning, ideas that consume our time.”Our lives swing like the pendulum of a clock as we move from task to task, plotting, strategizing, trying to foresee the future, remembering activities, schedules to keep and jobs to do, all measured by our 24-hour day. People are moving in that automated circle of time day in and day out, even with the future unsecured. We all await the moment when our plans will become reality, not understanding that may never happen. Will ancient time again squander the longings of the heart?Without hope, man feels the need to fight for his existence, an unintended consequence of God’s plan as He laid it out in the beginning. The creator and sustainer of the universe devised for each of us a plan, a coloration. He gave gifts to man, no two completely identical. When God outlines our day, is the organizer of our way, we remember to wait. Can He not, will He not fulfill His plans in us when we trust Him to do so?We need a daily devotional life, a time when we stop hurrying, running, and moving. A time when life is put on hold while we sit at Jesus’ feet, and allow His word, the Bible, to refresh our souls, to cleanse, rebuild and revitalize our spiritual lives. The Psalms remind us to “wait on the Lord.” We need God’s Light to show us our way. We need to “take time to be holy” to “speak oft with our Lord” while the world rushes on. We need a place and a time where our souls can catch up with our bodies.

They don’t understand they cannot make right choices while leaving God out of their lives.

suffolknewsherald_2023_8,"Published 7:08 pm Friday, June 30, 2023ByStaff ReportsKing David’s Psalm 37 in the Bible is full of wisdom. He has set before us a plate of good spiritual food. Let’s enjoy this and share it with our children and young people. It will help them avoid making mistakes like we may have made. Here is a snack from the Bible, the King James Version.King David tells us not to fret, and not to be envious. He says trust in the Lord and do good, delight yourself in the Lord, commit your way unto the Lord, rest in the Lord, cease from anger, forsake wrath, don’t do evil.A little that a righteous man has is better than the riches of many wicked. The Lord knows the days of the upright, the righteous shows mercy and is blessed, such as are blessed of Him shall inherit the earth. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delights in his way; though he falls, he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholds him…” And then, that wonderful insight for me, “I have been young and now I am old, yet never have I seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread.” At age 95, I can add my hearty, “Amen.”The phrase, “Families are falling apart” should make us aware of what is happening around us. It’s a sad commentary when we hear how many children do not have a father in their homes and lives today. Children need a father’s direction. Right words and actions have value. We will have more peace and be more at ease when we can agree to disagree and still love each other.The psalmist now has our attention and reminds us what the wicked are like. He says they watch the righteous and seek to kill people. He says he has seen the wicked in great power and “spreading himself like a green bay tree” (but “the wicked shall be cut off.” Those words should make us a prayerful people.The psalmist says the merciful man lends and his seed (children are blessed. Then, “depart from evil and do good and dwell forevermore…His saints are preserved forever… The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom… the law of his God is in his heart, none of his steps shall slide. The wicked watches the righteous and seeks to slay him.”What are we supposed to do? “Wait on the Lord and keep his (God’s way…” The Psalmist says “I have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree, yet he passed away and lo, he was not.”“Mark the perfect man for the end of that man is peace, but the transgressors (those who violate God’s law shall be destroyed together, the end of the wicked shall be cut off…but the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord.” He is their strength in times of trouble.We don’t know what another person may be experiencing or doing that will affect our lives. We do know we can come to God with our needs, our sins and our heartaches and find strength and help when we confess our desire to follow His plan for our lives. Living by what the psalmist says and teaching our children to do so would make a world of difference.Myrtle V.

suffolknewsherald_2023_213,"Published 5:52 pm Friday, August 25, 2023ByStaff ReportsAfrica is well known to Americans for its beautiful culture and magnificent wildlife. However, what hasn’t been adequately covered by Western media is what Ikenna Nwobu, a Nigerian-born international student and president of the Africa Connect Association at Liberty University, highlighted in our interview regarding the current state of affairs in Africa.Ikenna, a recent international graduate student from Liberty University in Lynchburg is well-informed about the happenings in western Africa. He emphasizes that Africa has evolved significantly over the last 40 years, transforming into a dominant sovereign state that is eager to engage in global business.Ikenna wants to convey that “Africa seeks an equitable trading system that benefits both parties and upholds the sovereignty of independent African nations.” He points out that western Africa has found such a deal with the BRICS organization, specifically China and Russia, asserting that “they engage in mutually beneficial business without imposing agendas that undermine African cultures, traditions, and sovereignty, as Western institutions have done in the past.” BRICS is an grouping of emerging market nations that is named after its six members, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Ikenna’s homeland, Nigeria, wields substantial influence in West Africa due to its rich natural resources, which the American government is well aware of and has benefited from for years.The climate in West Africa is undergoing positive changes for the benefit of its people, and America should acknowledge and respect this. The American government should exercise caution and refrain from interfering in Africa’s affairs.It’s not the West’s role to dictate decisions for African nations; doing so only portrays America as provocateurs on the global stage, seemingly “defending Europe’s industrial climate agendas that undermine Africa’s economic growth,” Ikenna said.America’s foreign policy stance should show respect for African nations as independent entities capable of making their own business arrangements, even if they don’t benefit America.To further understand the importance of the U.S. relationship with Nigeria, Ikenna Nwobus’ scholarly paper titled “United States Foreign Policy In Africa” details the historical realities and the future implications going forward.Drew Varner, a resident of Suffolk, is a researcher and writer.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_102,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°More than 75,000 nurses, nursing assistants, technicians, pharmacists and other health care workers at Kaiser Permanente went on strike in California and beyond this week. Their unions say it’s the largest healthcare strike in recent U.S. history.It is indeed unusual for American medical workers to go on strike. Lives are, after all, in their hands, raising the stakes of any walkout. But health care strikes are more common in other countries, and there is reason to believe Kaiser is on the leading edge of more labor unrest among care providers in this country.The Kaiser workers argue that the low pay and benefits, lack of adequate training and poor working conditions that led them to strike are also putting patients at risk. Health workers’ unions have said that strikes like this week’s can help improve patient care by addressing persistent staffing shortages. They say the better benefits and pay they are arguing for will encourage other workers to fill open positions and stay in their jobs longer. As of April, according to data obtained by the unions, 11% of union positions at Kaiser remained unfilled.My colleagues at Rand Corp. and I looked closely at entry-level health care workers a few years ago as part of a study for the Department of Health and Human Services. We found that this class of workers faces many challenges, including high turnover, poor working conditions, low pay and benefits, and few opportunities for advancement or training.Because of the nature of these workers’ roles in health care organizations, they often have little power to make changes. Striking might be the only leverage they have — and nonunion workers don’t even have that.Medical strikes are far more common in other countries. Doctors and other health care workers in Britain joined in the latest of a series of strikes this week, for example, and Israeli doctors went on strike in July over their government’s antidemocratic turn. Two American doctors recently argued in a commentary for the health care news site Stat that physicians here should be more willing to “adopt the tools of organized labor to become better advocates for their patients, and public health at large.” They went on to note that state interference in medical matters such as vaccination, masking and reproductive and gender-affirming care requires American doctors who know what good care should look like to stand up for it.Indeed, doctors who treat high-risk pregnancies are leaving states that have taken restrictive stances on abortion care in search of places that will allow them to serve their patients effectively. And if we learned anything during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was that expertise, particularly in science and medicine, has lost trust and status, compounding the pressures on health care. Scientists and doctors are being increasingly marginalized, their opinions less respected than those of social media influencers.Yes, people clapped for front-line health care workers during the pandemic. But the same workers often didn’t get the protective equipment they needed and were significantly more likely to be infected in the early days of the virus’ spread, causing as many as 180,000 deaths among health care workers worldwide in the first year and a half of the pandemic, more than 3,600 in the United States.It is nevertheless a relatively new phenomenon for the U.S. medical workforce to demand better working conditions for themselves along with better care for their patients. Kaiser’s nurses, techs and pharmacists are, for now, outliers. But they may be showing the way for the people who make up the rest of the vast American healthcare sector to take a stand for their needs and values.Shira Fischer is a physician policy researcher at the Rand Corp.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

Harvard Professor Claudia Goldin has spent her career illuminating not only the obstacles that women face but also how to overcome them.For these efforts, she is the richly deserving winner of the 2023 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.Goldin is a trailblazer on multiple levels. Of the 93 economic laureates since the prize’s inception in 1969, she’s only the third woman (and the first to be recognized solo, without co-recipients .She was the first tenured female professor in the Harvard economics department. And at a time when leading academics focused on building elegant but often deeply flawed mathematical models of the economy, she stuck to the painstaking work of collecting and analyzing empirical data to establish the truth.After studying the mechanisms of slavery and the cost of the American Civil War, she turned to the topic that would define her career: women and work.By parsing data going as far back as the late 18th Century, she discovered (among other things that female labor-force participation doesn’t necessarily increase with economic growth, and that education alone won’t eliminate the gender pay gap. Thus, other policies are needed to help women and the economy reach their full potential. Depending on a country’s situation, these might involve women’s expectations, access to contraception, parenting roles or the flexibility of work arrangements.Goldin’s insights have helped guide policymakers’ efforts to promote gender equality — which, if achieved, could add more than 50% to the economic output of some countries by expanding the labor force and better allocating human capital, according to one estimate. It could also boost incomes for both women and men.Yet adoption of even plainly beneficial measures, such as child-care subsidies, remains uneven — notably in the U.S., which last month allowed emergency pandemic-era child-care funding to expire, potentially leaving millions in the lurch.Aside from her research, Goldin has sought to address a stark disparity in her own field: Women comprise the majority of undergraduate students, but only one in four economics majors. True to form, Goldin’s initiative — which entails, for example, targeted information sessions and mentoring — is structured as a controlled experiment, to establish what actually works.Although the results have so far been mixed, it has boosted women’s enrollment in economics in some colleges and provided others with valuable information on how best to proceed.While Goldin often emphasizes how far women have come, her research also quantifies the struggles that remain. Women still earn less than men for the same work — particularly in high-paying professions such as law and finance, which require long hours and a lot of face time. By responsibly measuring the problem, she helps make further progress possible.It will take more time for women to achieve true equity in the workplace. But when that happens, they and all who benefit from their contributions will to a crucial extent have Claudia Goldin to thank.—Bloomberg OpinionNEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

eugeneweekly_2023_18,"We ve got issues. When it comes to community development, few endeavors possess the transformative power to invigorate local economies and create lasting memories for working families like a vibrant and successful minor league baseball team. The Eugene Emeralds have a storied history in our community dating back to 1955. The Ems are woven into the cultural fabric of our city. It’s hard to imagine life in Eugene without the Ems, but unless the Lane County Commission and the city of Eugene support a new stadium, that is the future we face. PK Park, our home since 2010, no longer works following Major League Baseball’s decision to upgrade the Emeralds from Short-Season to High-A Professional Baseball. This new and much more competitive level of baseball comes with an expanded playing season from 38 to 66 home games, creating a major scheduling conflict with the university. The Emeralds cannot be accommodated at PK Park. Now the Ems face an existential crisis: Without a new facility, the Emeralds will no longer exist, leaving thousands of fans with nothing but fond memories and depriving Eugene’s future kids the chance to make their own. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Much has been made about the potential price tag of a new stadium, but losing the Emeralds comes with its own set of costs, from lost jobs to loss of the team’s significant charitable contributions. When assessing the worth of investing in a stadium, we also can’t ignore the return-on-investment taxpayers can expect to receive from their continued investment in the Emeralds. ECONorthwest, an economic consulting firm, conducted an in-depth study to evaluate the economic impact of the proposed new stadium, finding that a new stadium will generate significant economic benefits for Lane County. The construction of the facility alone is expected to infuse $75.9 million in economic output and create over 500 full-year equivalent jobs. Once operational, the stadium will attract baseball fans and concertgoers, injecting an estimated $31.68 million in economic output and supporting nearly 300 full-year equivalent jobs, annually. Moreover, the study predicts significant “spillover” benefits for local hotels and businesses. The new stadium’s ability to host a variety of events, including both Ems and non-Ems competitive baseball games and concerts, will draw visitors to our city. This influx of visitors translates to 20,771 more hotel room nights and more than $4.1 million in hotel room revenues within our region annually, contributing to the overall vibrancy of our local economy. In the grand scheme of things, the stadium will be more than a mere sports facility. It’s a catalyst for economic growth, a generator of local jobs, a stimulus for community engagement and a critical community development asset. This stadium isn’t just about the Emeralds; it’s about our local community and what we want our city’s future to look like. In his recent op-ed, Richard Boyles,a hotel owner and industry representative, shared his reservations about the proposed Ems Stadium, but if you read his words closely, you’ll find that he agrees with the value of having a stadium. He just prefers it be built for track and field. We mustn’t fall victim to the trap of believing we are only deserving of one great opportunity and ultimately fighting amongst ourselves with the end result being obtaining neither one. If you agree that losing the Emeralds is bad for our community, make your voice heard. Contact your city councilor and your Lane County commissioner and tell them to Save Our Ems!"

Inflation has had a negative effect on everyone. While many of us adjust to changes like these by cutting back on expenses like dining out and movie tickets, older adults, who were once financially stable, are now struggling.An increasing number of our senior citizens are living month-to-month and facing difficult choices such as choosing between paying their rent or buying their medications. Some further compromise their health by limiting their food purchases. Extreme weather, such as high heat or freezing temperatures, can also become life-threatening if older adults are unable to keep up with their air conditioning or heating bills. Did you know that older adults are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population? How could this be happening right here in Hampton Roads?These are real situations that occur daily in our own backyards. Unfortunately, as a nation, we have been slow to recognize that the world has changed. Economists have long warned about the coming “silver tsunami,” but we fail to recognize that we are currently experiencing it. In fact, for the first time the 60-and-older population has surpassed the number of youths aged 18 and under. Our practices and policies need to be updated to be inclusive of older adults who deserve an equal share of respect, support, consideration and financial resources as the rest of our community.

leoweekly_2023_0,"Life is full of unexpected turns, and sometimes, the unimaginable becomes our reality. Losing a spouse is one of the most devastating experiences a person can go through. I never thought I would be a widower at 48 years old. It seemed like something that only happened to older individuals. But here I am, grappling with grief and navigating the lonely road of widowhood. I want to share my personal journey, offer insight into the profound impact of losing a partner, and highlight the lessons I ve learned along the way.When my husband, Jamie, and I exchanged vows 7 years ago, we believed we would grow old together, facing life s challenges hand in hand. But fate had other plans. We experienced our fair share of struggles, from job loss to financial hardship. The stress took a toll on us both. Despite the difficulties, we held onto the hope of a brighter future.My husband was a selfless person, always taking care of others. He worried about his aging parents, especially his father, who had numerous health issues. But nothing could have prepared us for the tragedy that awaited us. My husband took care of everyone, everyone but himself. He had complained of chest pain, but blew it off as stress. No matter how much I tried to get him to a doctor, he just refused! His exact words were, “I don’t have time to worry about myself when everyone needs me.” Jamie passed from a cardiac event in his sleep at the age of 49.The loss of a spouse is an incomprehensible and life-altering experience. Grief enveloped me, leaving me adrift in a sea of pain and sadness. The waves crashed relentlessly against the shore of my soul, shattering my heart into a million pieces. The loneliness and silence echoed throughout every aspect of my being. My husband s absence loomed over me, making even the simplest of tasks feel overwhelming. It was a solitary journey, with no roadmap to guide me. But amid the darkness, I discovered solace in the memories we shared.The memories of our life together became a lifeline during the darkest moments. Laughter, adventures, and the unconditional love we shared became a source of comfort. These cherished moments became a testament to the power of love that transcends death. They reminded me that although my husband is physically gone, his presence lives on in my heart. In the midst of my grief, I learned to cherish every precious moment, for life is fleeting and its brevity is painfully evident.Healing from the loss of a spouse is not a linear process. It is marked by unpredictable emotions, unexpected triggers, and periods of profound sadness. There are days when the pain feels insurmountable, and others when acceptance and peace seep in. Healing requires time, self-compassion, and a willingness to face the depths of grief head-on. Scars will always remain, but they become a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.This tragic chapter in my life has taught me invaluable lessons about love, loss, and the fragility of our existence. It has reshaped my perspective and deepened my empathy for others who have experienced similar pain. I ve come to realize the urgency of living with intention, savoring every moment, and prioritizing the relationships that enrich our lives. Life is too short to be taken for granted, and I am determined to honor my husband s memory by living a life filled with love, compassion, and gratitude.In the midst of grief and loss, it can be difficult to see beyond the darkness. But even in the darkest moments, there is a sliver of light waiting to be discovered. It is a reminder that no matter how painful life may be, there is hope for a brighter future. Seizing each day with unwavering strength and unwavering hope becomes an act of defiance against the overwhelming despair. It is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of love to transcend even death.Becoming a widower at 48 years old is a devastating blow that shattered my world. But it also taught me profound lessons about love, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit. Through grief and pain, I have discovered the importance of cherishing every moment and prioritizing what truly matters.Healing is a non-linear journey marked by ups and downs, but with time, self-compassion, and the support of loved ones, it is possible to find solace and create a meaningful and fulfilling life after loss.The holiday season is often filled with joy, laughter, and togetherness. However, for those of us who have experienced the loss of a spouse, it can be an incredibly lonely and overwhelming time. The absence of a loved one creates an emptiness that is amplified during this season of warmth and celebration.Navigating through the holidays as a widower can be arduous, but it is essential to acknowledge and honor your feelings. Surround yourself with a supportive network of family and friends who can provide comfort and understanding. Reach out to others who have gone through similar experiences, as they can offer solace and guidance.Embrace the memories and traditions that your spouse held dear, incorporating them into your holiday celebrations. This will not only keep their spirit alive but also bring you comfort and a sense of connection.We must allow ourselves permission to feel joy amidst the sadness, knowing that it doesn t diminish the love we have for our spouse. Practice self-care and self-compassion by indulging in activities that soothe your soul and nourish your well-being.Remember that grief doesn t have a timetable, and healing takes time. It s okay to have setbacks — I often do — or moments of intense sadness. We have to allow ourselves time to process these emotions without judgment.While becoming a widower is/was an incredibly painful chapter in my life, it has also brought forth tremendous growth and resilience. Today, I honor the love I had, cherish the memories I hold dear, and continue to move forward to live my life with meaning and purpose. It will take time, but I know that you and I can find healing and embrace a fulfilling life after loss. ( ."

Mazie Hirono for supporting efforts to crack down on illegal cockfighting and dogfighting.She recently cosponsored the Fighting Inhumane Gambling and High-Risk Trafficking (FIGHT Act, House Resolution 2742, in Congress to enhance U.S. capacity to deter and interdict these crimes.Cockfighters strap knives or gaffs to the birds’ legs to enhance the bloodletting in the fighting pits, while the dogs use their biting ability to tear flesh and deliver severe wounds to other dogs.Earlier this year, a horrendous mass shooting occurred at the close of a cockfighting event in Waianae, Oahu, that left two people dead and three others injured. Illegal animal fighting is almost always bound up with illegal gambling, money laundering, narcotics trafficking and other crimes.Hawaii is at the center of the cockfighting trade in the Pacific Rim, with fighting birds shipped from the state to the Philippines, Vietnam, Guam and Northern Marianas islands.Cockfighting derbies occur regularly and typically with impunity in Hawaii. It’s only because Hawaii has lax state laws against cockfighting, and that the federal anti-animal-fighting law is not actively enforced on the islands that these organized animal-cruelty crimes persist.It’s our hope that state lawmakers make cockfighting a felony, as dogfighting already is. Hawaii’s other lawmakers serving in Congress would help Hawaii by following Sen. Hirono’s lead and cosponsoring the FIGHT Act.Wayne PacellePresident, Animal Wellness ActionWashington, D.C.Taking away animportant decisionAlmost 350,000 U.S. teenagers under the age of 18 become pregnant each year. Approximately 82% of said pregnancies are unintended, and over 60% of them end up being aborted.Many people believe that if you get pregnant, you should keep the baby regardless of the situation. I would like to help you understand how abortion is simply a moral decision that women should be allowed to make on their own.From world statistics, it is known that as of last year, nearly half of all occurring pregnancies were unintentional, roughly 121 million. What about the girls who kept the babies? What happened to their lives? Were they able to continue living their lives normally and happily?When one gets pregnant by accident, why would they want to keep the baby? What if they can’t afford to raise a child of their own?Women can also be pressured by their parents, friends and relatives to keep the baby. Women could be shamed for their unwanted pregnancies, which only makes things worse for them in the end. These women forced to keep the babies are more likely to develop depression and anxiety. The big question really comes down to whether one wants to keep their baby, and if they are ready to do so.Twelve states have already made abortions illegal, with some of them being Oklahoma, Missouri, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. This means that if a woman didn’t want to keep her baby, she would either be forced to keep it or leave the state in order to get an abortion.Why take away a decision that has proven to stop so many problems?Malaquias Oliveros RiosHonokaa"

Building more roads is great for engineers and contractors, but it does nothing to address underlying Big Island transportation problems.We don’t need more roads and more traffic — more than 90% of those 22,000 cars traveling from Puna to Hilo carry only one passenger! We need new ideas to move people, rather than tons of metal around our island.One hundred years ago, we had efficient rail service between Puna, Hilo and Hamakua, but those services ended after World War II because of competition from automobiles, trucks and the devastating 1946 tsunami.Those railroad rights-of-way still exist in large part and could be used to restore efficient, low-cost transportation options for commuters and shoppers. Rail lines are less expensive to build and maintain than are roads, and could greatly reduce the unsustainable environmental costs of single-passenger car use.Perhaps county fuel taxes need to be raised to encourage commuters to use public transit rather than private automobiles?If more asphalt is to be laid, use it to build bus-only, high-speed lanes along existing roads.The Hawaii County Transportation Commission is a toothless entity that mainly serves to regulate the taxi industry and to serve the wishes of road-building interests. Give this commission some powers to “think outside the box” and to support long-term planning for our transportation needs!John LockwoodVolcanoRidiculous comparison of Biden and TrumpI cannot let the letter from Allen Russell in Your Views (Oct. 13, “President Biden messed up U.S.” pass without challenge lest I become complicit in this false equivalency.Mr. Russell seems to forget the many legal visitors denied entry into our country by former President Trump.The one classified file found in Biden’s former vice president’s office does not compare to the many boxes of files found in the bathroom of Trump‘s Florida home.Biden immediately relinquished that file, while Trump refused to return the files requested, as well as further concealing them.Trump became cozy with dictators like those in North Korea and Hungary, as well as Putin.These are only a few of Trump’s egregious offenses against our democracy.Lois Margaret DrakeVolcanoRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2023_194,"Published 6:43 pm Tuesday, December 12, 2023ByStaff ReportsDr. William A. Radasky and Dr. Peter Vincent Pry have articulated a grave warning to the American public through the “EMP Task Force on National and Homeland Security Investigations” report, titled “Blackout Warfare: High-altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (Hemp Attack On The U.S. Electric Power Grid,” on Aug. 6, 2021.The report details an analysis for national security on the damage of an EMP attack on our infrastructure, insinuating that we have not prepared for this at all, and it is critical that we do. These types of attacks would wipe out everything that is powered by electrical components, which is 95% of everything in society. This report got little coverage from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, and the media pretended like it didn’t exist.As Iran led an “attack on at least one device at the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania” over Thanksgiving holiday, the real threat of a blackout from an EMP, or cyberattacks, is a prevalent danger to our society today and needs to be talked about more so that the general public can prepare themselves; either be through self-sustainability measures, or the municipalities offer government subsidies for either educational preparedness programs on the local level that allow leaders in the community to have a plan for this scenario.Something needs to be addressed and procured before something happens to our infrastructure that is detrimental to our sovereignty and our children’s lives. Neither Biden nor Trump is going to fix this. This requires American citizens on the local level to get active and understand what is going on in our community. By communicating with your state delegates, you can stress the importance of this issue to further delegation for a preparation program that community leaders can be involved in, draw on, and look to because if the grid ever goes down, having the necessary precautions in place and the public aware will lessen the likely hood of destruction and chaos; especially here in Suffolk where we cherish the small town community vibe.Once a program like this takes off, the communication will spread, more people will be aware of the agenda, and a blackout plan can be in effect. As tensions rise globally, the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa nations are deemed to dethrone the dollar and cast America’s economy into the dark. Alliances are being drawn.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_143,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°As I watched the presidents of Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania struggle last week to respond to harsh congressional questioning about the prevalence of antisemitism on their campuses, I had a singular thought: Censorship helped put these presidents in their predicament, and censorship will not help them escape.To understand what I mean, we have to understand what, exactly, was wrong — and right — with their responses in the now-viral exchange with Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. The key moment occurred when Stefanik asked whether “calling for the genocide of Jews” would violate school policies. The answers the presidents gave were lawyerly versions of “it depends” or “context matters.”There was an immediate explosion of outrage, and the president of Penn, Elizabeth Magill, resigned Saturday. But this is genocide we’re talking about! How can “context” matter in that context? If that’s not harassment and bullying, then what is?But I had a different response. I’m a former litigator who spent much of my legal career battling censorship on college campuses, and the thing that struck me about the presidents’ answers wasn’t their legal insufficiency but rather their stunning hypocrisy. And it’s that hypocrisy, not the presidents’ understanding of the law, that has created a campus crisis.First, let’s deal with the law. Harvard, Penn and MIT are private universities. Unlike public schools, they’re not bound by the First Amendment, and they therefore possess enormous freedom to fashion their own custom speech policies. But while they are not bound by law to protect free speech, they are required, as educational institutions that receive federal funds, to protect students against discriminatory harassment, including — in some instances — student-on-student peer harassment.Academic-freedom advocates have long called for the nation’s most prestigious private universities to protect free speech by using First Amendment principles to inform campus policies. After all, should students and faculty members at Harvard enjoy fewer free speech rights than, say, those at Bunker Hill Community College, a public school not far from Harvard’s campus?If Harvard, MIT and Penn had chosen to model their policies after the First Amendment, many of the presidents’ controversial answers would be largely correct. When it comes to prohibiting speech, even the most vile forms of speech, context matters. A lot.For example, surprising though it may be, the First Amendment does largely protect calls for violence. In case after case, the Supreme Court has held that in the absence of an actual, immediate threat — such as an incitement to violence — the government cannot punish a person who advocates violence. And no, there is not even a genocide exception to this rule.But that changes for publicly funded universities when speech veers into targeted harassment that is “so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim’s access to an educational opportunity or benefit.” First Amendment scholar Eugene Volokh has helpfully articulated the difference between prohibited harassment and protected speech as often the difference between “one-to-one speech” and “one-to-many speech.” Legal commentator David Lat explained further, writing, “If I repeatedly send antisemitic emails and texts to a single Jewish student, that is far more likely to constitute harassment than if I set up an antisemitic website available to the entire world.”As a result, what we’ve seen on campus is a mixture of protected antisemitic (as well as anti-Islamic speech and prohibited harassment. Chanting “Globalize the intifada” or “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” at a public protest is protected speech. Tearing down another person’s posters is not. (My rights to free speech do not include a right to block another person’s speech. Trapping Jewish students in a library while protesters pound on library doors is not protected speech, either.So if the university presidents were largely (though clumsily correct about the legal balance, why the outrage? To quote the presidents back to themselves, context matters. For decades now, we’ve watched as campus administrators from coast to coast have constructed a comprehensive web of policies and practices intended to suppress so-called hate speech and to support students who find themselves distressed by speech they find offensive.The result has been a network of speech codes, bias response teams, safe spaces and glossaries of microaggressions that are all designed to protect students from alleged emotional harm. But not all students. When, as a student at Harvard Law School, I was booed and hissed and told to “go die” for articulating pro-life or other conservative views, exactly zero administrators cared about my feelings. Nor did it cross my mind to ask them for help. I was an adult. I could handle my classmates’ anger.Yet, how sensitive are administrators to student feelings under other circumstances? I had to chuckle when I read my colleague Pamela Paul’s excellent column on the Columbia School of Social Work and she quoted a school glossary that uses the term “folx.” Why spell the word with an “x”? Because some apparently believe the letter “s” in “folks” renders the term insufficiently inclusive. I kid you not.Moreover, each of the schools represented at the hearing has its own checkered past on free speech. Harvard is the worst-rated school for free expression in America, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. (I served as the group’s president in 2004 and 2005. So, even if the presidents’ lawyerly answers were correct, it’s more than fair to ask: Where was this commitment to free expression in the past?That said, some of the responses to campus outrages have been just as distressing as the hypocrisy shown by the school presidents. With all due apology to Homer Simpson and his legendary theory of alcohol, it’s as if many campus critics view censorship as the “cause of, and solution to, all of life’s problems.”Universities must absorb the fundamental truth that the best answer to bad speech is better speech, not censorship. Recently, I watched and listened to a video of a Jewish student’s emotional confrontation with pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University. Her voice shakes and there’s no doubt that it was hard for her to speak. She seeks a “genuine and real conversation” but also tells her audience exactly what it means to her when she hears terms such as “Zionist dogs.”Confronting hatred with courageous speech is far better than confronting hatred with censorship. It is obviously important to protect students from harassment. I’m glad to see that the Department of Education is opening numerous Title VI investigations (including an investigation of Harvard in response to reports of harassment on campus. But do not protect students from speech. Let them grow up and engage with even the most vile of ideas. The answer to campus hypocrisy isn’t more censorship. It’s true liberty. Without that liberty, the hypocrisy will reign for decades more.© 2023 The New York Times CompanyA new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."

Oodles of regulations and taxes and high housing, labor and shipping costs all conspire to hamstring aspiring entrepreneurs.Hawaii is one of the most challenging states in which to start a business. Oodles of regulations and taxes and high housing, labor and shipping costs all conspire to hamstring aspiring entrepreneurs.Even folks who simply want to sell homemade food products must jump through numerous hoops. Considering that one of the state’s official goals is to boost local food production, that just doesn’t seem right.For example, imagine you have an auntie in Ka‘u who wants to start selling her famous lilikoi jam. She’s an excellent cook, and the neighbors often compliment her jams and jellies when she gives them as gifts.One of her neighbors tells a cousin on Maui how amazing the jams are, and this cousin gets in touch with your auntie to buy a few jars through the mail.But stop right there. State law prohibits homemade foods from being sold through the mail unless they were made in a commercial kitchen.Commercial kitchens can cost between $20 and $50 an hour to rent, and often serve large catering and events businesses, which limits their availability for mom-and-pop bakers and cooks. Likewise, few commercial kitchens exist in rural areas, which limits opportunities for rural entrepreneurs.Your auntie could sell her jams to buyers in person, like at a swap meet or farmers market. But again, she may not label and consign them at a coffee shop, restaurant or other local business unless she makes them in a commercial kitchen and has a “food establishment” permit.State rules for meats, seafood, pickled foods and some sauces are even tougher. No one can sell homemade poke or barbeque, even to a relative or neighbor, unless it has been made in a commercial kitchen and meets other state standards.Yes, customers should not have to worry about eating toxic foods, but do these rules really keep people safe?The national Institute for Justice, which tracks data on homemade “cottage” food laws, says there have been no confirmed cases of foodborne illness from cottage foods in California, Iowa, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah or Wyoming — all states with relaxed homemade food laws.Of course, food safety remains a legitimate concern, but that by itself is not a sufficient reason to subject local homemade food sellers to such harsh regulations.Tackling this issue in the 2023 Hawaii Legislature was state Sen. Dru Kanuha of the Kona, Ka‘u and Volcano areas. Kanuha joined with other lawmakers to introduce Senate Bill 756, which they called the Access to Local Food Act.The bill would have simplified and streamlined regulations on Hawaii’s cottage foods community along the lines suggested here, and helped fulfill the state’s goal of boosting local food production.As the bill stated in its preamble, “The Legislature finds that local food production is integral to the state’s economic development and food security.”The good news is the bill passed the Senate unanimously. The bad news is it failed to gain traction in the House.So the idea remains for state lawmakers to pursue and implement.Talk alone won’t make it happen. Hawaii lawmakers should revisit the Access to Local Food Act bill in 2024 to expand opportunities for local food entrepreneurs — like your imaginary auntie in Ka‘u.Jonathan Helton is a policy researcher at the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

eugeneweekly_2023_59,"We ve got issues. To the hateful: Did you hate when you were four? Hatred is learned behavior. Maybe that’s why you pretend your hate is “natural” — not a choice, not something you’re responsible for. What’ll it be like for you when you give up hate? Surrender will begin when you have no choice but to face and embrace my full humanity. Surrender will begin when you can’t avoid seeing yourself in me any more; when you have no choice but to see fellowship and beauty in me when you want to see foreignness, idiocy, derangement and abomination. When you have no choice but to face and embrace my humanity, you’re left to see your fortress of rationalizations and justifications for what it is. You won’t be able to hide that you’ve been the one defending it to avoid seeing how naughty you’re being. When it rises, the question “Why am I doing this anyway?” will doom your bigotry. That question will herald a flood. Waves of shame, sorrow, regret, horror and grief over the possibilities you’ve squandered will tear your fortress apart, and you’ll want it gone. This is transformation, and for anyone, even you, dear hateful, it will give you four-year-old eyes again. Life will become new again. Colors will brighten. Your body will move differently. You’ll wonder why you held on so long. If you stay open, you might notice gratitude, even joy and serenity among the waves. You’ll see that where you feared losing your very self, you’ve gained unimaginably. Are you laughing at what I’ve written? That’s the sound of your walls trembling. Now let’s get down to the practical stuff. How do I transform your hate when you’ve arrived in our town with buddies and a thirst for glee? How do I transform your hate in the middle of your performance? I admit I don’t know, but let’s test a theory. I have two hypotheses. One: If you’re a committed bigot, you’re an addict. That’s not an insult, it’s psychology. To get your fix, you need me to follow your script: I’m supposed to hate you back and go into fight, flight, freeze or fawn so you can 1 be right about me and 2 feel justified in doing whatever you’ve got planned for me. If I fight, you can call me “sadist,” “hypocrite” and “monster.” If I flee you can call me “weakling.” If I freeze, you can call me “weirdo.” If I fawn you can call me “trophy” and parade me around as a symbol of your “triumph” and “divine sanction.” If I buy that your name-calling means anything about me, I’ll freeze in the “impossible bind” you’ve set up for me, then you can call me any name you like. Two: One of my friends says: “When I’m authentic, you can’t help falling in love.” When everyone understands one and two, everyone will get why you hate when I stay present, vulnerable and authentic in the face of your performance. By focusing on my breath, I can slow my nervous system and observe, not react — even when fight/flight/freeze/fawn tugs at my insides, I can abandon guile, laugh at our shared humanity. and trust the strength of defenselessness. I can be fluid. You won’t be able to predict me or count on your fix. Instead you’ll be forced, over and over, to face our shared humanity. You won’t let yourself harm me, because you’ll have to look at the blood on your hands. At this point you’ll do anything to make me question my worth, intelligence and sanity, won’t you?Anything to capture my big river in your little box. Chances are, you’ll get bigger, noisier and more belittly, baity, eye-rolly, impatient, name-cally and sarcastic. But if I stay with you and your process, you’ll know I see you naked. When I don’t shame your nakedness, you might just set yourself free. Then maybe we can talk about what we’re really needing. I have to admit that sometimes, dear hateful, I’d rather just put you in my box, throw things at you, and respond to your emotional and sometimes physical violence in kind. I’m only human, and if deep listening fails, I’m glad for those on my “side” willing to do that. But I’ve studied enough history to know where that road leads. I don’t want to go there. Again. Sigh. Let’s take transformation to the streets, y’all. Interested? Find me. I’m apparently easy to spot in a crowd.

In the top left corner ran a censorship notice reading: “The News-Herald cautions and reminds its readers that all War News is subject to censorship and makes no effort to distinguish between propaganda and actual truth.”The beginning of 1941 saw Franklin Delano Roosevelt building up the U.S. military. Billions of dollars were sent to countries in Europe.Across the country, more than 20,000 were on strike against defense contracts at factories as of mid-February 1941. Most would be resolved by fall.War progressed throughout Europe. On March 5, headlines read “Hitler turns war of nerves on Turkey and Jugoslavia,” “British officer tells of U-boats” and “Britain breaks relations with Bulgaria.”As early as April 2, 1941, reports of local servicemen injured in war time training appeared. The first I came across was D.F. Barnett Jr., a cadet at Army flight school in Florida, who was injured when his plane stalled on a turn and fell from the air.War requires material, and Suffolk saw that in many defense contracts in the local area. Due to these contracts for material, Suffolk’s waterfront again hummed with shipping activities as ships were loaded. Lumber was shipped out at an increased pace with almost a traffic-jam pace. One of the boats loading lumber was a three-masted schooner using sails. In May, with increased traffic from defense contracts and with the approach of warm weather, a plan was created to re-route traffic around the business district of Suffolk. The routes avoided left-hand turns and attempted to break up traffic headed to different destinations. A bypass in the process of being built was mentioned in the article as a long-term solution.In June, headlines highlighted discussions of life in a war-torn world. “Mrs. Sheffer suggests Suffolk collect aluminum,” “Food cost here going up as everywhere else,” “Powers to draft private property up” and “Studying use of oil pipelines” all told of the news of the time. The country was sending supplies and preparing for what it seems everyone knew to be inevitable. Stories detailed the air battles between the Royal Air Force and the Nazis, providing reported downed planes for each side. Notably, the reports never matched, each side saying more of the opponent was lost.The July 2 paper listed all who were mailed Selective Service questionnaires. War preparation was well under way. A July 30 headline, “Japanese bombs strike American Navy gunboat during Chungking raid” hinted even more at the looming war. The ship was in a “safe zone” yet still hit by bombs dropped from Japanese aircraft.In late summer, Boy Scouts held aluminum scrap collections; more than 4,500 pounds of aluminum was collected from the area. In Suffolk alone, 1,130 pounds was collected by the Scouts.Some still hoped for peace. On Dec. 3, 1941, a headline of what appears to be an opinion article reads “European war’s end seen by some in another year.” It mentions comments from the New York mayor and several others proclaiming that by the following Thanksgiving, the war will have ended.On Dec. 7, 1941, a special Sunday afternoon edition was published, with what looks to be a 150-point headline announcing the bombing of bases in Manila and Pearl Harbor. America had been attacked.As of Dec. 17, 91 officers and 2,638 enlisted Navy, as well as 168 Army men, were buried on the hills of Honolulu. The story detailed the simple burial ritual as well as the detailed labeling of each body to ensure they could be sent to their hometowns after the war was over and won.Censorship laws took effect in mid-December as the country now entered the war full force.Locally, air raid and blackout alarms were tested. The Red Cross began offering first aid classes, open to the public as reports of war poured in.The year ended in war. Headlines from the final day of 1941 included, “Half of national income going for war next year,” “1,122 volunteers services in civilian defense corps,” and “More blackouts, raids, tests sure.” A local story featured a Suffolk man who survived a U-boat attack. Ship’s fireman Frank Bowles of Grace Street was tending gauges on a U.S. freighter, Sagadahoc, when a German torpedo struck. “The damned thing struck the starboard side only 30 feet from where I was standing,” Bowles said. The story goes on to detail his escape from the engine room as it filled with water and the steam lines exploded. He was rescued with others after seven days in a rescue raft. According to the story, his ship was torpedoed Dec. 3 by a U-boat that made no attempt to ascertain the ship’s identity.Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_40,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°I recently wrote about the various unveilings and intimations of new alignments that have accompanied the Israel-Gaza crisis — with one reveal being the extent to which immigration is transforming European politics, forging a mass movement of Arab-Muslim protest that in turn may be driving European voters and even European elites toward the anti-immigration right.However you react to that description, whether it inspires anxiety about assimilation or anxiety about xenophobia, it should be accompanied by a large reminding asterisk:This is only the beginning. That is to say, whatever you see happening in Europe now is just the initial stage of the defining world revolution of the 21st century — the rapid graying of rich countries (and soon, not-so-rich ones joined to the great migrations from the more youthful regions of the world.I want to recommend two windows into this incipient revolution.One is the first installment of a series from my New York Times colleague Declan Walsh about Africa’s “youthquake,” the surge in population growth that’s going to give the continent the world’s largest workforce within the next decade — two out of every five babies born worldwide by the 2040s, at least a third of the globe’s 15- to 24-year-olds by 2050.Along with Walsh’s reportage on the promise and peril of this boom for Africa itself, and some amazing photos from Hannah Reyes Morales, the piece is worth reading if you still need to be disabused of the notion that the 21st century will exactly resemble the prophecies of overpopulated doom from the 1970s, with teeming masses overwhelming resource-strapped countries everywhere. In fact, Africa with its youthquake is increasingly a global outlier; much of East Asia, Latin America and the Middle East have a median age that’s rising and converging with Europe’s and North America’s. And what’s most striking about Africa’s situation is not some general Malthusian crisis, but the geographic-demographic imbalance, the deep and inherently unstable divide between the African continent’s youth and poverty and the rich and aging European continent to the north.That means the dilemma of the 21st century isn’t how Earth will feed an ever-growing population, but how the world will deal with a potential mass rebalancing of population via migration, an altered wealth-and-people equilibrium, in a world where technology is making the movement of peoples easier than ever. The hopeful way to view this transformation is as a win-win: “African countries have a vital resource that aging societies are losing: a youthful population,” is how Walsh puts it, and you can imagine the future as an acceleration in the exchange of resources, with younger African workers going north and sending remittances south to help boost the developing economies they leave behind.But it won’t be that simple. For one thing, as you see already in European migrant preferences, migrants don’t necessarily want to go to every aging country; they want to get to the richest or most dynamic or most generous ones — better Italy and Spain than Bulgaria or Romania, better Germany and Sweden than Italy or Spain.So some aging countries, the not-as-rich ones, are likely to see continued emigration by their own young people (this is Ukraine’s dilemma, accelerated by war , rather than a simple replenishment by immigrants from Nigeria or Morocco or anywhere else. This may also be true in the Americas: As demographic decline sets in across Latin America (birthrates are well below replacement in several Latin American countries you won’t necessarily see an end to northward migration; rather, the driven and ambitious will continue to try to reach the United States, and stagnation may set in or deepen in the countries that they leave behind.Clearly, the richest countries will be able to replenish their populations with immigration across the 21st century — if they choose. But the anxiety of Europeans right now over their existing minority populations taking to the streets to protest for Palestine (or, it’s feared, for Hamas , and the punitive measures, like literal neighborhood demolitions, already being taken in countries like Denmark to try to break up immigrant enclaves, are just a foretaste of the political turbulence inherent in that kind of transformation.Because, again, the scale of what we’re talking about, the interaction between migration pressures and low birthrates, is not mass immigration as we knew it 50 years ago. Here it’s worth reading a new paper by Paul Morland and Philip Pilkington, respectively a demographer and an economist, modeling Britain’s economic and demographic future. Britain had below-replacement fertility for about half a century, and it’s been relying on unprecedented immigration rates to supply younger workers — “by a very long way the fastest ethnic change the country has seen, not since the Norman conquests of the 11th century, but rather since the Anglo-Saxons arrived in the 5th century, or maybe earlier still.”That’s what happened already, and it hasn’t prevented Britain from already slipping a bit into economic stagnation. (Here it’s also important to stress that when you rely on immigration for younger workers, it’s not a one-off solution: If your birthrates stay low, you have to keep finding new immigrants, because immigrants don’t all come as 18-year-olds; they themselves age and become retirees, their own birthrates converge with natives’, and they often bring their older relatives after them. What will happen, though, is something much more dramatic. According to Morland and Pilkington’s projections, if current birthrates hold in Britain, within 50 years, more than a third of the country’s population would need to be first-generation immigrants to keep the old-age dependency ratio around 40%. (A 25% ratio means there are four workers for every retiree; a 50% ratio, just two. If birthrates slump much further — toward the dire level seen in South Korea — to maintain a sustainable dependency ratio in the late 21st century, more than half of Britain’s population would need to be first-generation immigrants.I don’t think you need to be especially pessimistic to regard that kind of transformation as incompatible with stable democratic governance. It’s among the reasons you already have the rightward shift in European politics and why immigration restriction will be a winning issue for the foreseeable future in many European countries.But a rightward and anti-immigration shift without some novel source of people, Morland and Pilkington point out, yields the European equivalent of what we see already in Japan — a cultural preservationism linked to steady economic decline.This is an alternative that some on the de-growth left and nativist right might explicitly favor. But I am very skeptical that simply choosing a stagnant preservationism will be sustainable for rich countries that aren’t islands off the northeast coast of Asia (and even Japan may yet be transformed . Europe is geographically adjacent to the African youthquake; it already has many channels for migrants to enter, along with substantial existing immigrant communities to help welcome them and immediate economic opportunities for new arrivals.Whatever migration’s potentially destabilizing effects in the longer term, there’s a reason even right-wing governments in places like Italy and Poland have struggled to make restriction stick.It’s not that I think borders inherently can’t be enforced or that immigration can’t be restricted and redirected; clearly policy matters, as you can see just in the differences between the Biden administration and the Trump administration.But the circumstances of the 21st century are going to be highly unusual by historical standards, Europe’s situation is different from America’s, and I think conservatives and immigration restrictionists who imagine that it’s simply a matter of will are going find that even a much more right-wing continent will end up looking more like Morland and Pilkington’s scenario of rapid and destabilizing demographic transformation than like contemporary Japan.There is, of course, another possibility, which is that dynamism could be restored by higher birthrates, a “more children” option, which would render immigration less economically necessary while perhaps also making substantial immigrant populations less threatening to natives and more easily assimilated.© 2023 The New York Times CompanyRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

leoweekly_2023_27,"Dear Republicans,We have all watched the parade of people interviewed at Trump rallies and in all candor, there is quite literally nothing to be proud of in any of them. To be generous, the entire lot are paranoid, functionally illiterate, insane or embarrassingly stupid.You are welcome to watch all of the YouTube videos of attendees and there are only two characteristics that can be said of the current state of Republicans; you are either evil or wickedly stupid.Do you have no self-respect at long last that you continue to hoist these petards of imbecility into office?If you are unsure of this incontrovertible fact, just look at what Tommy Tuberville tweeted out saying that high-speed internet will help Alabamians. The problem of course is that Tommy voted against it. Not only has he claimed something he voted against as his own, he is currently refusing to confirm promotions in the military until every armed service agrees not to transport any servicewoman needing an abortion in our military.If you think this is an aberration, you’d be wrong.Congresswoman Nancy Mace touted the $26 million grant for the Shipwatch Square Transit and Workforce Center project as something she heartily supported as one of her accomplishments. The problem of course was that she also voted against that funding.What is it that you are for anymore? I know I know, cutting taxes and restricting women from having control over their own bodies.What that has done is more harm than you are willing to admit. It has long been a lie iterated by the likes of Dick Cheney who is a known and dedicated liar that ‘tax cuts pay for themselves.’While you have coddled that particular sophistry since Ronald Reagan introduced it, you have made the richest nation the biggest debtor nation which pays so much interest on our national debt that China has used that money to build 28,000 miles of high speed rails.Do you appreciate how much your gullibility and stupidity cost us as a nation?Of course, you don’t because that would require intelligence none of you seem to have anymore.We have to listen to the morons in the Republican nomination race talk about building a bigger and better wall to something something ‘stop illegals from crossing.’Why is it so impossible for you all to learn history’s valuable lessons from say, The Great Wall of China or the Maginot Line? Walls have never and will never work especially because we have these things called airplanes.It’s also extremely frustrating that you all alone refuse to do anything about immigration which is having terrible effects in Florida and Georgia right now because a bunch of Republican simpletons passed legislation that says the states will arrest any ‘illegal’ and put them in jail for two years and then deport them.The problem of course is that immigrants are the ones who pick the crops in Florida and most of the construction workers are not Americans. So all the farmers who voted for DeSantis are all shocked and horrified that immigrants have fled Florida to the point that farms cannot find anyone to work.Not only has this reached a critical point, new construction is at a standstill because builders cannot find anyone to build anything because the immigrants have fled in fear of the stupid legislation your nitwit fellow Republicans passed because your base is so dumb they do not understand that we need immigrants in this country.The same is happening in Georgia at the moment and legislators are saying, ‘We really didn’t mean to do all this so just ignore it’ trying to lure immigrants into staying and it isn’t working at all.If your policies were not bad enough, we have to put up with the ridiculous and endless lies told by Trump about how he is protected under the Presidential Records Act. Despite Republicans specifically passing that law because of Richard Nixon to stop him from stealing national records, you all seem to be as oblivious as Trump as to what the PRA was passed for.It was passed to keep someone like Trump from stealing any records at all, especially Top Secret documents. It is beyond exhausting having to put up with the sheer idiocy of every single goddamn Republican shithead on Fox trying to equivocate what Trump did with what Hillary did because none of them seem to be aware of the difference between ‘classified’ documents and ‘Top Secret’ documents!They are not the same!Hillary did not have nuclear secrets for fuck’s sake!Trump has admitted on multiple occasions that he had Top Secret information and there is a tape of him discussing Top Secret war plans against Iran with people who had no security clearances at all!How in the hell do you all summon the unmitigated gall to excuse this?Aren’t you the ones who claim to be so strong on national security?What the hell happened?Now we have to listen to the endless nattering of that ridiculously stupid wench Barney Rubble Greene not only try and support Vladimir Putin but now we have to endure the gobsmacking imbecility of that vapid b!tch trying to erase the two Trump impeachments!That is quite literally impossible!How much more hell do you intend to put the country through because the base has jumped the shark and flown off the crazy cliff?I mean I know how stupid the base is because it’s full of evangelical morons who still think this is a Christian nation founded on Christian principles. Even that ignominious taint barnacle Tommy ‘The Dunce’ Tuberville isn’t that dumb! Actually, he is but that’s beside the point.The point is that Joe has done a good job and there is absolutely nothing Republicans have done in the House to accomplish anything.The Weaponization of Government Committee’s chairman Gym Jordan promised dozens of ‘whistleblowers’ who were going to ‘blow the lid off government corruption’ and you know how many of these ‘whistleblowers’ he or James Comey produced?None. Zero. Not even one.Everything Republicans say or do is a performance of stupidity and the problem is that Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Traitor Greene do not have even a basic amount of intelligence to know how stupid they truly are and you all keep re-electing them so what does that say about you?It says you’re all fucking morons and I am no longer going to coddle the wanton stupidity that afflicts you collectively.I am sick of your incessant lying and outright treason while you pony up to Vladimir Putin who is a merciless war criminal perpetrating a mass murder while you all sit around with your thumbs up your asses blaming Ukrainians for this war because Zelensky is Jewish.Jack Smith is about to file the charges against the seditionists on January the 6th and when Trump is finally convicted for his many felonies against this nation then just know that you are equally to blame for electing that carnival-barking traitor.Subscribe to LEO Daily newsletters.|NewsBreak (coming soon ||||| ( ."
eugeneweekly_2023_21,"We ve got issues. If you’re in downtown Eugene on a Saturday morning, you’re likely to see crowds of people flocking, tote bags in hand, eager to grab the freshest foods at the local farmers market. There’s no doubt, the southern Willamette Valley boasts some of the widest diversity of locally grown and produced goods in the country. From artichokes to tomatoes, table grapes to watermelons, the summer is a time to celebrate the bounty of our fertile soils. But while the positive impact on your weekend morning may be the first to come to mind, local markets are also responsible for supporting the social fabric of our community. Every year, farmers markets across the country come together to celebrate all that they do during the USDA proclaimed National Farmers Market Week. This year, celebrations are August 6 to 12, coordinated by the Farmers Market Coalition. So what better time to acknowledge all that farmers markets do to create loving communities? If you’ve shopped at a farmers market, you’re likely aware of the benefits. Things like access to the freshest food; supporting small scale businesses; boosting local economies; and helping to combat climate change. But the big, intangible thing that farmers markets do is create relationships between the people that grow our food and those that eat it. And these relationships are vital to creating a resilient community. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Farmers markets are community gathering spaces. This role became evident as the world shut down during the height of COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, farmers markets in Oregon adapted with drive through models, online pre-ordering, and special shopping hours for vulnerable populations. These efforts maintained a vital support system as the world was socially isolated. A robust local food system proved to be essential during COVID. As we saw global supply chains fail, farmers markets stepped in to provide a vital source of nourishment to their communities. Programs likeDouble Up Food Bucksmatch the value of SNAP benefits (formerly food stamps , dollar for dollar, up to $20 for the purchase of locally grown produce. Food access programs like these support communities experiencing poverty without sacrificing farmers’ bottom line. Today, as food prices rise due to inflation, and increases in SNAP benefits end, these programs help to maintain connections between shoppers and growers. The relationships that farmers markets are founded on help tobuild resilience in communities impacted by climate change and wildfire disasters. During the catastrophic 2020 wildfires we saw farmers step up to donate fresh food to evacuees and open pasture land for evacuated livestock. Communities in turn showed up for farmers, forming volunteer “Crop Mobs” to help with harvesting or cleaning up damage. The generous spirit of connected communities has really shown us the power of networks. But farmers markets haven’t always been the most welcoming to everyone. A long history of racism and discrimination has created a perception of farmers markets aspredominantly white spaces. In 2021 the Farmers Market Coalition supported the creation of anAnti-Racist Farmers Market Toolkit, aimed at creating more equitable farmers markets. This toolkit, created by 10 Black food systems experts from across the country, focuses on how farmers markets can integrate an anti-racist framework within their “Mission, Management, Messaging, and Measurement.” Local groups like the Oregon Farmers Markets Association (OFMA have used the guidance of this toolkit to create training and peer learning opportunities for markets that are interested in creating more equitable spaces of belonging. As a result, the culture and perception of farmers markets is beginning to shift, and it’s a change that benefits everyone. Markets grounded in their community’s needs are more relevant and effective Farmers markets are vital to creating community; to building localized systems that are resilient in the face of climate change, pandemics, inflation and volatile economic systems. So when you’re shopping at your local market this week (Eugene has several! , think about the ways that you can show up for your fellow shoppers, farmers and farmers market organizers beyond just buying your weekly groceries. Try volunteering, adding an extra tip at checkout, donating to the market, or writing a sincere thank you card to market organizers. Let’s celebrate farmers markets every week!"
suffolknewsherald_2023_85,"Published 5:03 pm Tuesday, March 28, 2023ByStaff ReportsBy Tom MastaglioAmerican Legion Post 49National Vietnam War Veterans Day is observed March 29. It was designated as such by the Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act of 2017 signed by President Trump to recognize the more than 6 million U.S. military veterans who served during the Vietnam War. President Obama called “upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that commemorate the 50-year anniversary of the Vietnam War.”March 29 was chosen because on that date in 1973 the last U.S. combat troops departed the Republic of Vietnam. All 6 million men and women who served in the U.S. military from Aug. 5, 1964 through May 7, 1975 are considered Vietnam-era Veterans.Last year President Biden reaffirmed the nation’s commitment to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, which began on Memorial Day, May 28, 2012, and which will continue through Veterans Day, Nov. 11, 2025. He called upon all Americans to seek out and extend the nation’s profound gratitude to our Vietnam veterans and their families and caretakers, expressing compassion for the families of the fallen, those who remain missing and unaccounted for, and all others who served yet no longer walk among us.Locally, we recognize these veterans at the Smithfield American Legion’s annual dinner, in some local churches during their weekly services and special programs at the Isle of Wight County Museum. But, there are few local and regional public events to acknowledge this national day of recognition.Given the paucity of public recognition of this holiday in our area, I am calling on each of you to take the time to remember the service of our men and women who served as well as the families of veterans during the week of March 29 by privately acknowledging them.Consider doing this personally by contacting those you know or encounter this week at stores, restaurants and in other public places who are Vietnam-era veterans. That generation is generally proud of their service in spite of the lack of appreciation at the time shown to those who served in the war zone then returned home or any who publicly wore the uniform. They were not just disrespected, but often denigrated as a focus for the frustration of those politically opposed to the war.Despite these anti-war protestors representing a minority demographic in our country, there was a failure by the silent majority to nevertheless publicly acknowledge the sacrifices of our soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and coast guardsmen. Vietnam-era veterans can be recognized by the proud display of inscriptions on their hats, shirts and jackets that announce they are Vietnam War Veterans.Regardless of your politics, then or now, I implore you to recognize those who served by “welcoming them home” and thank them for their service. Perhaps more civic organizations can next year organize public ceremonies to acknowledge the sacrifice of these veterans and the families who lost loved ones in the Vietnam conflict. Our veterans deserve and would appreciate nothing more than a show of appreciation for their sacrifices.Tom Mastaglio is the media and publicity coordinator at the American Legion Post 49 in Smithfield.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

suffolknewsherald_2023_154,"Published 8:00 pm Friday, January 13, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardIn times of division and uncertainty we often yearn for the kind of transformative leadership that was taken nearly 55 years ago when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered in Memphis.We need someone like him at the moment. Sadly, we seem more estranged as a people than we ever have.There are some glimpses of the world King envisioned and the message he carried with him in his tireless fight for racial equality. The S. Delois Mayes Scholarship Foundation’s annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day event Monday morning at River Stone Chophouse in North Suffolk will surely radiate the love for humanity the former minister preached and practiced. He’d be proud of the Mayes Foundation’s commitment to college scholarships to help young people achieve their dreams.Yet still, King’s legacy of — to name a small sampling — bravery, principle, sacrifice, grace and peaceful activism is sorely lacking in so many of our influential public figures today. On this, his birthday weekend, it becomes particularly striking that we have been bereft of King’s massive presence for such a long time. Generations of Americans know him only from the choppy, black-and-white reels of his awe-inspiring oratory.King’s birthday is a unique national holiday in that it is devoted primarily to a person and the ideals he represented. It is a day off that at the very least forces us to recognize the significance of the man.We would be better off as a country if we also took the opportunity to not only recognize King’s accomplishments but honor his legacy by considering how we can improve our country and world by making it a more unified place.As we do every year, many of us gather to pay tribute, but hopefully to also take stock of what we can to forge solidarity and advance the causes of equality. In the days and years ahead, we should consider King’s lessons and strive toward the kind of country he died pursuing.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2023_70,"Myfather, Ricardo, was born in 1930s Texas to a Mexican American father and a mother from Coahuila, Mexico who spoke no English. He was the seventh child of nine, and they all lived and worked on a farm in Texas until his father answered an advertisement for factory jobs in California. The family moved into a small three-bedroom bungalow in booming East Los Angeles. The family included his nine children, wife, mother-in-law, and various other relatives struggling together to make ends meet.My mother, Sarah, was born in a house in Madisonville, KY, to an illiterate miner and his second wife who was 14 years younger than he. Her mother, my grandmother Mary, had been picked to wed because my grandfather, Rubin, saw her in the front window of her house on his walk home from the coal mines.Mary found her journey into motherhood with advice from her aunties and cousins to buy a bottle of an unknown substance at the local store for her to drink. The elders laughed as they shared “There’s a baby in every bottle,” which began many years of pregnancy and homemaking, producing seven children from at least 12 pregnancies. Sara was the second, and all were born in homes that are still standing today.Sara met Ricardo through the military.My father had two options at 17 years old: leave home to a factory job or join the military. He and his brother chose the latter and went overseas, beginning carousel tours of military bases, which landed him in Ft. Campbell, KY. Since he was alone and had nowhere to go for Thanksgiving, he was invited to a home-cooked dinner by his friend who happened to be dating a friend of my mother. My mother’s friend begged her to come along and meet their guest for a blind date. My mother agreed.“Lucy” had officially met Ricky.She was blue-eyed with curly golden hair, round hips and a 19-inch waist — a beauty. Ricardo didn’t stand a chance.He was brown with a strong jaw, and jet-black hair that matched his shiny black Pontiac Catalina convertible. He had an accent and was immaculately dressed, with a pressed shirt tucked in belted pants. He wore shiny shoes and the finest “high and tight” haircut the military could provide. My mother found him arrogant and shared with me that he barely spoke 10 words to her, which included a request for her phone number to meet up again. To this day, she has no idea why she gave her number and then responded to his call two weeks later after he completed field training. Her instinct said to jump, blindly. She said that at that moment, everything in her life changed.The second date landed him in the home of white, coal-minin’, country folk. Her family had not interacted much with minorities and racist language was regularly spoken, yet he was welcomed into their lives without derogatory references. They kept their tongues, but their feelings were there. My grandfather did not speak a word to him and was afraid of his dark skin, pristinely put-together outfits, and strong accent. My grandma enjoyed him from day one, as he loved to be in her home observing her natural cooking style and ability.He stayed with the women during visits. It felt comforting to him as he found little difference between his L.A. family and the Kentucky home of my mother. He felt relaxed in the rural setting with fishing, good food, and the chatter of multiple generations of adults and children crammed into a tiny house, dirt-poor.As my parents got to know each other, my father began to open up about who he was. He stated very early on that he was an alcoholic and owned by the military before anything else.Their dates started in her home, drinking coffee brewed by her mother to sober him up before they left for a drive in the country or a rare outing to the local picture show. Their courtship lasted for two years with no chance of consummation until after marriage. His acceptance of her boundary is a core factor of why they worked as a couple for 32 years until he passed in 1993.My mother was schooled in tolerating and staying safe among alcoholics and men without boundaries. She was determined to not be taken over by lust or indulgence in alcohol, as these two social ills were the things she hated the most from her childhood. The violence to which she was accustomed was the direct result of adults drinking in her home. My father’s drinking didn’t come with violence.Why did my mother Sarah, a white Kentucky girl, jump into a life with my father, a Mexican man born in Texas, raised in East Los Angeles? It was the ‘60s, and for her, he was consistent and never pushed her into anything without her consent. My father, in the life they built together, was kind and gentle even when intoxicated, and he offered her a strange feeling she had never felt around men…safety.•*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_17,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°It’s bad enough that Congress and the White House are making no serious effort to cut spending these days – something we all wind up paying for, whether we realize it or not. But to keep adding to the deficit? That’s worse.In recent weeks, the Biden administration has submitted two supplemental spending requests to Congress. The first is $106 billion for “security” items, and the second is $56 billion for “domestic” programs.That’s a $162 billion wish list of spending increases. The budgetary approach taken by the administration and many members of Congress is, to put it mildly, profoundly irresponsible.Yes, some aspects of the requests, such as helping Israel in its fight against terrorism, addressing the crisis at the southern border, and the ongoing debate about aid for Ukraine, are important matters for Congress to discuss.However, by seeking to place all $162 billion of requests in the “emergency” category, the administration hopes to dodge the bipartisan spending limits agreed to this spring. That means the entire amount would be financed through deficit spending.This would be problematic under normal circumstances. Today it’s downright dangerous.That’s because America is still suffering the economic consequences of the $7.5 trillion spending spree that Congress went on from 2020 to 2022, using the pandemic as an excuse to throw money at a variety of special interests.The incredible volume of deficit spending helped drive inflation to multi-decade highs, reducing purchasing power by thousands of dollars per household.In response, the Federal Reserve has dramatically increased interest rates, disrupting financial markets and making home mortgages unaffordable for millions of families.That means it’s vital to reserve the “emergency” label for situations of national importance that were unforeseen at the start of the annual spending process. Responding to the barbaric attacks by Hamas on innocent Israelis is an example of a genuine emergency.In contrast, the administration’s spending requests are loaded with provisions that were well-established at the start of the year, such as the war in Ukraine. But claiming that items such as broadband internet subsidies, communications infrastructure and child care benefits – however important they may be – warrant “crisis” funding strains credulity to the breaking point.The reason for such requests is that the administration and its allies are addicted to deficit spending.Thus, they’ll take every opportunity possible to exploit budget loopholes and deliver your hard-earned tax dollars to special interests.It’s increasingly clear that Washington is allergic to responsible budgeting. Rather than responding to genuine emergencies by reducing or eliminating spending on corporate welfare schemes and boondoggle projects, too many legislators behave as if all existing programs and bureaucracies are sacred.A step in the right direction would be for Congress to limit “emergency” spending to real emergencies. Our leaders should have the common sense to separate what’s truly urgent, such as supporting Israel, from items that can go through normal appropriations, like broadband subsidies.Otherwise, we’re all going to wind up paying the price – literally."

Unfortunately, both the Keaau and Hilo recycling centers were unable to take it due to limited space.I went through the scale, and the attendant charged my credit card for the tipping fee due. No problem. The fee was $4.47. I would have been glad to pay more.(Last week , I received a letter from county Department of Environmental Management saying that I owed 75 cents more, and to pay that promptly.How much did it cost in time, postage, wages, etc., to have a county employee send that notice to me? Probably at least $10, to be generous, and maybe a lot more.In my 20s, I spent three years and three months working for another county government. I quit because I was just wasting my life fullfilling stupid government requirements of the job. Good job, good pay, great benefits, but that particular job required one to have a total lack of motivation.Part of the requirements for a county job should be that the employee be allowed to act with some common sense, but the county has rules that must be blindly followed!I have paid the overdue amount, including a generous 25-cent overpayment to help the county fix the roads, improve the subdivisions, revitalize the recycling centers, move forward on the homeless issue, and numerous other important issues facing the county.Bob GleasonKurtistownIt’s time to start measuring resultsAbout the Dec. 6 article, “Council approves homeless funding”: I have been able to get to know many of the homeless people in West Hawaii by chatting with them, learning their names and stories, and offering insights to them as a medical professional, when asked.It is time well-spent on both sides of the relationship. However, seeing most of the same people on the streets now that I did months and years ago fuels my concern, as well as my agreement with Hawaii County Councilwoman Rebecca Villegas, that the intent to help by distributing money is real, but there are no measurable results on homelessness in Hawaii County from money already distributed to many of the same organizations that are about to get their next distribution.Per Susan Kunz, the upcoming $10 million distribution will be working to bolster the programs and services that play a vital role in protecting and uplifting some of the most vulnerable members of our community on Hawaii Island. Again, what did the county get in return for the $7.5 million investment made earlier in 2023 to many of the same organizations?Is there a nonbiased, nonincestuous, noncronyistic plan to review the effect of each organization’s piece of last spring’s distribution of funds? Will this review method also be applied to the nearly $10 million distribution that was just approved? Is there a measurable effect of these distributions on reducing the number of homeless persons in Hawaii County by next year this time?I hope so, because as I understand it, the recently approved $10 million distribution for 2023-2024 has another $35 million to be distributed over the next four years.Edwin HerdKailua-KonaNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
suffolknewsherald_2023_93,"Published 4:28 pm Tuesday, March 21, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardSuffolk voters would have bid farewell to them regardless come January, but we’d be remiss not to acknowledge recent retirement announcements by veteran state Sens. John Cosgrove, R-Chesapeake, and Tommy Norment, R-James City County, and thank them for their service.Each currently represents a portion of Suffolk, which was sliced and diced into four state Senate districts during an especially creative round of gerrymandering a decade ago. To their credit, Virginia voters subsequently, via a constitutional amendment, took responsibility for once-a-decade redistricting away from partisan legislators and put it in the hands of a bipartisan commission, with the state Supreme Court as the backup option should the commission fail to agree on new state House and Senate and federal congressional maps. Indeed, the court had to step in and handle the remapping after the 2020 Census.Despite some whining from both parties and incumbents who were inconvenienced in the process, we think the court’s map drawers did a terrific job, especially in creating the new Senate District 17, which consolidates Suffolk and all of rural Western Tidewater in a single district.Regardless of whether Clinton Jenkins, Emily Brewer or Hermie Sadler eventually wins the seat later this year, the region will be well served by having its own senator in Richmond, rather than being an afterthought in Peninsula and metropolitan Hampton Roads districts such as has been the case.That’s not a criticism of Norment or Cosgrove, nor of their Democratic colleagues who represent portions of Suffolk, Sens. Louise Lucas and Monty Mason. It’s just reality in elected service that you pay closest attention to the population base in your district. After all, those are the people who will determine your fate in the next election.In the case of Cosgrove and Norment, the 2019 election turned out to be their last. They recently joined a wave of retiring lawmakers ahead of the 2023 election cycle. Cosgrove has served Senate District 14 since 2013 after previously serving in the House of Delegates. Norment’s service in the Senate goes all the way back to 1992. He is currently the chamber’s top-ranking Republican.Both represent an era of civility and statesmanship in politics that, sadly, has been dying in recent years on both sides of the aisle, replaced by bombast and disrespect for people who don’t think exactly like you. They never saw politics as a war between good and evil but as a space where occasionally compromising with well-intentioned opponents is good for Virginia and its people.We wish them both good health and happiness in life after politics.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

eugeneweekly_2023_0,"We ve got issues. The article about the Hentze Family Farm (“From Agro-tourism to Micro-brewery,” Nov. 20 ,sketches a woeful tale of a heritage farm beleaguered by petty land use regulations. Regrettably, the report is rife with misinformation and a critical omission. The Hentzes claim they are prevented from making a viable farm income because they’ve been denied a brewery, and their Type 1 county permit would allow only four events a year spaced 90 days apart. In fact, the farm is already approved as a brewery and has no limit on the number of events it can hold. According to Keir Miller, Lane County’s Land Management Division Manager, the permit “allows a farm to conduct operations that are directly related to the sale or marketing of malt beverages produced on site through a variety of means, including: malt beverage tastings in a tasting room or other location on the premises occupied by the farm brewery; malt beverage club activities; brewer luncheons and dinners; farm brewery and hop farm tours. In addition, it allows farm breweries to host up to 18 agri-tourism events per year.” Moreover, the barn that didn’t meet the county’s 100-foot setback requirement has received a variance, and it’s possible that a variance on the amount of acres required for hops, or the allowance of an alternative crop, will be granted, as well. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. What the story fails to mention is that the Hentzes are behind a bill that state Sen. Cedric Hayden re-introduced in the 2023 legislative session as SB 1087, which would allow “farm cafeé” on farm-zoned land in Lane County. For all the ostensible concern about a brewery, that is the Hentzes’ real purpose. There are compelling reasons why this bill was overwhelmingly opposed by a wide range of Oregonians. Farm stands are a common, pleasing and permitted seasonal attraction for produce grown on site and restricted to ensure that sales from them do not exceed the overall sales from farm crops. The Hentze bill, however, would allow a restaurant as large as 5,000 square feet — larger than the typical small town café — that could readily become independent of the produce and sale of crops onsite. What the restaurant would produce is year-round traffic and pollution, lighting and noise that could disturb wildlife and neighboring property owners and more global warming. Now in its 50th year, Oregon’s land use program became a model for the nation, but the system has been under siege since its inception by development interests intent on weakening or destroying land use regulation. LandWatch Lane County, the nonprofit I head, has been working with neighbors for more than 25 years to keep such farmland as the Hentzes’ own growing crops, not restaurants, and other urbanizing structures and infrastructure. We’re an experienced, successful and readily accessible land use watchdog willing and able to help county residents — including media reporters — navigate the shoals of land use law and applications for development on Lane County’s rural lands. Interested and concerned parties should consult our website at LandWatch.net."
suffolknewsherald_2023_142,"Published 7:13 pm Friday, January 27, 2023ByStaff ReportsSuffolk is home to pockets of diverse communities that work together as one organic system. Communities are not always easy to maintain; complications will always rise to occasion; therefore, the way the community tackles these situations will determine the health of the system itself.When a community is growing in population it is very important to be open and communicate with all of the public on all of the changes that are coming to the city. This open line of communication will allow the people’s voice to be heard and respected. All must be welcomed and have a seat at the table; and we must not seclude the voices of those that cultivate the survival of the community in times of stress, need and survival.What makes Suffolk special is the peaceful fellowship one can see among the diverse communities in this beautiful city. This can be seen at the Peanut Festival, Fourth of July Festival, Taste of Suffolk, Pow Wow and many more celebrations and festivals across Suffolk.It can be seen in the local coffee shops and breweries. It can even be seen in the halls of the Ruritan meeting houses; which was formed locally in Suffolk back in 1928, to kindle the fire of fellowship among the community service activities and spread goodwill across the land. These places are where the people’s cultures are secured; and where the people go to fellowship with one another. It has replaced city hall in the department of community outreach in some ways.The key element that allows the system to flourish as one Suffolk community is the fellowship amongst all the individual communities and their representatives in the city. Therefore, by keeping the fellowship, it will secure the self-sustainability of the community in times of uncertainty; allowing a constant line of communication and the ability to help one another in times of need.In today’s world, America is seeing times of multiple nationwide complications and uncertainty; either be manufacturing, agriculture or industrial issues. On top of that, the mainstream media, on both sides of the political psyop, is feeding the country social divisiveness. All of this is happening at a time in world history where a Fourth Industrial Revolution is being discussed among the elites of the world; for which will bring many life changing decisions that may trickle down from the federal level; and will be imperative to the path of survival and structure of our society going forward.We must not allow that divisiveness to blind our eyes to the importance of keeping the community we are growing and holding to the constitutional freedom that we harbor among the fellowship of individual communities. This is the community where our kids grow and live in, and keeping that matters wholeheartedly.Suffolk should be confidently reminded of the diverse self-sustainable community we already have; ranging from the agriculture community that can feed the city in times of a true hunger crisis; or the church community that provides help for the needy in Suffolk, and that will work off the clock to help lend a hand in times of distress; or the mechanics that build and run the infrastructure we dwell in, including the water sources that we all drink from. All of these communities have two things in common: they will serve in times of need and they are the ones that will provide for the city when all else fails. So we must include their input in all aspects of city planning and agendas, and we must not abandon the primitive communities that are here in Suffolk.Getting active in the community and fellowshipping with each other is the way we will grow together as one collective community made up of unique individuals. The Declaration of Independence laid the groundwork for the civic community to respect everyone’s individual rights under the constitutional order of Natural Law. The survival of each other depends upon people getting active in the community. We must be open and accepting to all honest individual communities that plant seeds in the collective community garden of Suffolk.Drew Varner resides in Suffolk and is president of Suffolk Ruritan Club.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2023_66,"When I graduated high school, I was unsure of what I wanted in a career. I always loved art and music but came from the school of thought that I needed a “real” job that came with health insurance and a solid retirement plan. This idea was planted in me from having parents who were not allowed to self-actualize in their passions. They poured their energy into giving my sister and me better chances than they d had.The military brought my impoverished parents into the middle class. Raised with opportunities and education that expanded our minds and opened worlds, my sister and I had chances that my parents were never fortunate enough to dream of.We were indulged and exposed to ideas of hope — “Feed The World” — in a society that should have learned to take care of itself and our planet. I chose my worldview and set out to become who I wanted to be in the world. From a difficult history, my family seemed to finally produce women who could choose their careers, and how they wanted to live their lives.I started college thinking I could change the world with U2 blaring in my ears about the dichotomies of politics, money, and war. I felt on fire and that I was called to be a part of a new world that sought equality and choice.I got four years of college paid for via a War Orphans grant, but I had to go to school in Kentucky. This made my partial scholarship to Stephens College in Missouri, a prestigious all-female school, illogical and not cost-effective. I was interested in journalism but found writing from an objective or unbiased point of view was not in my nature.I got my basics done at a community college, then headed to WKU to study advertising. Commercials with jingles and humorous quips hooked me from a childhood when television became our babysitters, and I thought it to be a good fit for me.I took a required class called “Persuasion,” and it pushed me into a huge dilemma about having an ethical career. I was challenged to see how advertising could damage society. The example before me was the creation of Joe Camel for Camel cigarettes. This cute cartoon character was focused on hooking them young. The cigarette industry knew they had an addictive product, and could benefit from a twelve-year-old getting hooked for life. To be involved in this industry was out of the question at this point.I changed my major to social work and moved to Louisville. My father had passed away, and I was on my own financially. I worked in mental health while in school and learned from the streets alongside the books.The real-world work experience from inpatient psychiatric and street social work was the best education I could receive. I was full of passion by the time I talked my way into a position at the Home of the Innocents in their Pregnant and Parenting Teens program. I received my first salary of $19,000 per year — a joke, but one I was happy to accept. I was in my early twenties, helping to grow a program with young homeless families not much younger than myself.I completed my bachelor’s and master’s degrees with this job, and I hit my goal of making at least $30,000 a year by the time I was 30. My pride in my accomplishment of being a part of something that truly helped stop homelessness in young families fed my grieving and lost soul.The time came to pay back my loans and hopefully thrive in my career, but the world of social work was shifting from a street-based model with qualitative data to one that was backed by big medical dollars that needed quantifiable outcomes to flourish. I found myself begging for funds to keep programs going and to maintain salaries for the staff.The work got harder, and the children and families we served got more and more difficult to handle. The salaries did not improve over time, and I found myself having to jump through more and more hoops to maintain my own healthcare and living expenses alongside my clients.My company hosted a dinner that cost $100 a person. I couldn’t afford to attend.Seeing others’ trauma and personal struggles for 30 years will affect you no matter how strong and educated you think you are. Now, I find myself disabled, having had to retire early from my chosen career. The sicker I got, the less I could afford the copays for prescriptions I needed, and the residual student loan payments took any monetary benefit I had from having an education and career.As I look at my student loans today, they are stagnant — the same $42,000 that I originally borrowed. It doesn’t add up that the $60,000 I’ve already paid is not enough.That being said, I own my ignorance about how these predatory loans worked.I’m also dismayed by the fact that I had to be found disabled to afford the meds I needed for feeling healthy, finally.As a nation, we are richer than we have ever been, and farther from true humanity. Yet, I stay here with my little fire still burning with hope.*** ."
eugeneweekly_2023_60,"We ve got issues. With all the recent discussions about the crisis of homelessness, I have not seen any acknowledgement of the elephant in the room. By elephant, I specifically mean the Republican Elephant. While acknowledging that mental illness and drug use are to blame for much of the homeless situation, recent “state of” Eugene, Lane County and Oregon addresses stated that one thing that will help would be to address the lack of affordable housing, but they didn’t mention one of the main reasons for this lack. Any graph depicting the number of unhoused people over time will show a steady rise starting in the mid 1980s. It’s not a coincidence that this corresponds to the time when Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party were able to con the voting public into believing that lowering the rate of taxation in the highest tax brackets would stimulate the economy and bring in enough revenue to balance the budget. Then a hopeful for the Republican Party presidential nomination, George H.W. Bush referred to this scheme (scam as “voodoo economics” because he knew it wouldn’t work, and it doesn’t. Not only do we have the crisis of homelessness, we also now have massive government debt. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. During the 1950s through the early 1980s, my father worked for Morrison-Knudsen, a civil engineering and construction company based in Boise, Idaho. He told me that the company wouldn’t raise executive salaries above a certain point, because once they reached the highest tax bracket, most of the extra pay would have to be paid in taxes. This salary structure allowed them to turn a profit, even when they paid their workers enough for them to buy houses and cars for their families. The executives didn’t suffer, either. H.W. Morrison, one of the founders of MK, had enough to pay for the construction of Ann Morrison Memorial Park and the Ann Morrison Center for the Performing Arts in Boise. I am sure that he was able to write off the park and arts center to reduce his taxes, but I wonder if he would have had the same incentive to give these lasting gifts to the city of Boise under America’s current tax policy. Contrast that scenario with our current era. With such a large portion of the wealth being concentrated in the hands of executives and corporate shareholders, there is less money to circulate among the rest of us. Instead of raising wages to make their products affordable, corporations outsource the production of clothing, electronics and other consumer goods to overseas factories that pay little more than starvation wages. If it were possible to build houses overseas to import to the U.S, we might not have such a dire need for affordable housing. But the housing crisis is only an example of the worst thing about the current situation. Our democratic system of government is threatened because once the Republicans realized the extent of gullibility of the voting public, they have used a constant barrage of propaganda consisting of half truths and lies to convince a significant number of voters to vote contrary to their own self interests. Some have gone so far as to commit insurrection in support of the most proficient and prolific liar in the history of American politics. There will be no solution to our current crisis unless we attack the real cause. In this era of alternate facts and election denial, it might be hard to get the public to realize that a system of truly progressive taxation would be good for everyone. Without that we are doomed to suffer in a system where most people must live with whatever the elephant allows to trickle down."
suffolknewsherald_2023_115,"Published 5:12 pm Friday, February 24, 2023ByStaff ReportsFor those of us who were in high school in the 1990s, we cannot hear or read the slogan “Just Do It” without being reminded of Michael Jordan.My mind instantly goes to my favorite photo of him. You know the “Wings Image” of his dark, chiseled, muscular arms perfectly outstretched at his side. You could draw a line connecting his left fingertips to the right side edge of the basketball clinched in his right hand.Jordan, it seems, became the face of the slogan along with other great athletes of the 90s. Nike’s slogan is no longer seen for the three words that comprise it. “Just Do It’ may as well be one word with several related meanings such as commitment, victory, determination, perseverance, grit and the list goes on. The brilliance behind successful slogans is that their individual words are lost in meaning as the slogan becomes widely accepted for the intent for which it was launched. Nike is pretty proud of that.But I wonder if you might indulge me for a moment and separate the slogan into the three words used to create it. They each have their own meanings,Justmeans “conforming to a standard of correctness: proper.” It is also defined as “acting or being in conformity with what is morally upright or good: righteous.” The word is an adjective and can be used to define an object as it proceeds a noun in the sentence or replaces the object altogether as it does when referring to people, nations or groups.Domeans “to bring to pass, carry out.” It also means to “execute, commit, perform or produce.” The word is a transitive verb. In past, present or future tenses,dobecomesdid, done, doing, ordoes. I tend to think ofdoas one of the most passionate and sacred words in the English language as it is used to express vows and commitment to one another. Only two letters pack so much spoken meaning.Itis “used to refer to a thing previously mentioned or easily identified.” Much of its use is as a pronoun “used as subject or direct object or indirect object of a verb or object of a preposition usually in reference to something.” I believe we don’t recognize how often we use this word in our everyday language. You cannot do without it.After I dismantled the slogan, reviewed the meanings of each word individually and then put it back together, I discovered a different meaning of “Just Do It.” I believe this is a call to action for those who identify as just people. There are some identifiable objectives that you should be doing. Just people should be carrying out some commitments. Just people should be bringing to pass some conditions. Just people execute justice in a world that is full of injustice.Well…the first thought I had to myself after I saw this call to action within this slogan was “am I just?” Honestly, I find it difficult to identify the characteristic of being just on anyone to include myself. We do not live in a just world.I do not believe we see just works demonstrated before us in our everyday living. We are not readily displaying what “just” looks like for developing young people because we don’t show it in our governments, in our schools, in our hospitals, in our care of the needy or in our concern for people’s welfare.The New Kings James Version translates the familiar Bible passage saying in Habakkuk 2:4: “Behold the proud, his soul is not upright in him; But the just shall live by his faith.”The New Century Version states it more directly: “The evil nation is very proud of itself; it is not living as it should. But those who are right with God will live by faith.” So in that context, the question becomes not only “am I just?” but rather “am I doing as I should?” Living by faith is not just reading the word of God and professing to know Jesus Christ. Living by faith is clearly defined here as those who do faith work which is justice work which is doing what you should be doing because it is righteous. As Spike Lee said: “Do the right thing!”Right doesn’t have to be hard. We put up images of what victory looks like in the form of great athletes and commercials showing heroic feats. There is a Nike commercial on YouTube titled “Rise and Shine” with the voice of a single narrator that says: “Welcome to the grind. For what is each day but a series of conflicts between the right way and the easy way.” I pray we choose the right way. Live By Faith: Just Do It.QuaWanna N.

leoweekly_2023_31,"Ihave never really understood how different my childhood was until I had a child. Children of the seventies are the last of a way of life that has changed dramatically. As we enter the age of AI, and the ability to connect all over the world from our bedrooms, the memories of a bygone era flash before my eyes.It was the late seventies and the children from my neighborhood were feral — left on their own until dinner or later. We owned the area, making playgrounds of the woods and construction sites that were expanding as our small city grew. On any given day, there were, at least, 20 kids from 5 to 18 years of age running around my cul-de-sac and the streets surrounding Congress Drive.We ran in packs like wolf cubs — unsupervised until the porch lights came on. It could have been something like “Lord of the Flies” but, somehow, we took care of one another, wherever we were — at the pool, fort building in the woods, or an evening game of kickball. We saw the same faces every day and even if we were mean or mischievous on occasion, we cared for each other.There was one house — an older couple with no kids. This home was off-limits and the couple seemed to be rife with chronic bad moods and definitely not enamored with children. They fortified their front yard with trees that kept them hidden, and the man would often lock our toys up if they were to land in his yard. They were the only ‘haters’ on the circle but they were outnumbered.Outside was the place to be. Barbies went camping in the elements and posed in “Hawaiian” waterfalls created from drainpipes, and went “Dukes of Hazard” in their Barbie cars on ramps made from dirt.My two favorite Barbie accessories were Evil Knievel’s wind-up motorcycle and parachutes that I could attach to my barbies as I flung them into the air for daredevil adventures. My father stayed annoyed, having to get them down from our trees over and over, but he never complained.I honestly do not remember any adults being around when we were out. I know they watched through windows, and checked in sometimes, but we were mostly unsupervised for hours on end and went anywhere in the city.Parents then did not panic and had no problems yelling at any kid who was found misbehaving and needed a boundary set.My first physical fight was set up by my best friend, Chrissy. She had me fight another girl in the neighborhood to see who would get to play with her that day. I adored Chrissy and was willing to go for it, but Penny was too much for me as she knew how to fight.We were on the front porch and there were rose bushes on either side. My plan was to use my weight and push her into the bush to inflict the quickest pain as I had no idea how to actually fight someone. My plan failed as her hits landed in sharp pains to my head. I went home crying followed by the laughter of those that chose to watch the “great” match. My mother offered little sympathy and allowed the lesson to be learned on my own.I graduated from my big wheel to skateboard to bike fairly quickly. Never did I see elbow/knee guards or a helmet anywhere; and I have the scars to prove it. Running around barefoot was common and we just went swimming to sterilize the wounds. I knew that my scab would be off soon if it bubbled from the chlorine and I could have smooth skin back, all pink and new.Banana seat bikes were best for transporting groups as we headed out to the ballpark across town or the pool. I did not own a lock or chain and just parked and left my bike on the kickstand. We never had lunch packed for our adventures. We had some change from the piggy bank and spent the afternoons loaded on soda and candy. Sunscreen was a rarity, and baby oil was all the rage.These were the days when you would be dropped off at the skating rink or arcade downtown for hours. Most of the supervisors working these entities were teenagers themselves. We would dress up in Jordache jeans, make badass pom-poms for our skates and show off our skills under flashing lights and loud music.It was an adventure, and all the kids had one goal; PLAY.•*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_56,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°The other night, after a long family dinner, my 13-year-old niece disappeared into our downstairs closet and soon reemerged with a box of toys I’d saved from my daughter Chloe’s childhood. Chloe, who is now 31, was surprisingly happy.“I want that,” she said, reaching for a Furby. “That one too,” she said, looking at a wooden Keith Haring dog that was once part of a red-and-yellow pull toy.Was my grown-up, nurse practitioner daughter doing that thing called “kidulting”?This portmanteau of “kid” and “adult” refers to grown-ups who try to recapture the fun and innocence of childhood by surrounding themselves with the trappings of their youth — playing dodgeball, skateboarding, riding e-scooters, watching “SpongeBob SquarePants,” wearing footie pajamas or collecting Hello Kitty-branded anything.The New York Times recently described kidulting as “decades old,” but claims it has gained traction recently with the success of the “Barbie” movie, and Mattel’s subsequent announcement that no fewer than 13 films based on its toys are currently in development. In 2021, a surprisingly large percentage of parents — 58% — told the Toy Association (formerly the Toy Manufacturers of America that they have bought toys for themselves in the past year. Hasbro, by the way, recently announced it will reintroduce the Furby.“The pandemic helped fuel (kidulting as more adults turned to the comforts of childhood as a form of self-care,” declared the New York Times.As someone who put away a distressingly large number of grilled cheese sandwiches during the COVID-19 shutdown, that resonates with me. And heaven knows, we could all really use some of those childhood comforts right about now.“You face the big bad world, and it’s terrifying,” said the writer and artist Christopher Noxon, who coined the term “rejuvenile” nearly 20 years ago to describe the phenomenon. His 2006 book “Rejuvenile: Kickball, Cartoons, Cupcakes, and the Reinvention of the American Grown-up” launched a spate of stories and talk-show discussions about adults who don’t want to grow up, at least not all the way. Who can blame them?“It’s hard to imagine adults in previous eras so unashamedly indulging their inner children,” Noxon wrote. “But these are not the adults of twenty years ago. They constitute a new breed … identified by a determination to remain playful, energetic and flexible in the face of adult responsibilities.”I can’t imagine my grandmother roller skating, or even riding a bicycle. My own parents, hip as they were, were not about to go boogie boarding or play dodgeball with their children. They had us young, they grew up fast, they entered the world of adulthood so much earlier than we did. They didn’t really have the luxury of catering to their inner child, which perhaps explains the pervasive midlife crises and soaring divorce rates of their generation.American corporate interests have glommed onto the idea that there is a way to combine products for kids with the childhood nostalgia of adults.It’s no coincidence that Noxon’s book led to his stint as a business consultant, advising corporations that make things like snack foods on how to broaden their market appeal to include adults.“You need to find a way to exploit and encourage a consumer’s sense that adulthood is for saps,” he told me. “I’ve worked with hotel chains trying to figure this out. That chocolate chip cookie you get at reception? That’s a total rejuvenile move!”The “playful” tech bro culture of Silicon Valley, where getting rich too young can lead to delusions of grandeur, probably represents both the high and low points of the trend.The disgraced cryptocurrency “genius” Sam Bankman-Fried, for example, actually enchanted venture capitalists by acting like an adolescent during serious meetings. Journalist Zeke Faux, who profiled Bankman-Fried for Bloomberg, told NPR, “When Sequoia, the venture capital firm, found out that Sam had been playing ‘League of Legends’ while pitching them, their reaction was just like, ‘Oh, my God, we love this guy. How do we give him hundreds of millions of more dollars?’ “They are undoubtedly less enchanted these days.In my life, I am surrounded by adults whose joie de vivre is enviable. I would describe them as rejuveniles in the most positive sense. They have all the trappings of adulthood — jobs, kids, deadlines, mortgages — but have retained so much of their childhood joy.My friend Kevin has sought to recapture the free spirit of his youth with a VW camper for his frequent surf trips. My friend Steve has parlayed his childhood passion for comic books, toys and sci-fi into a successful career as a 3-D character designer whose signature character is a retro-styled pencil-wielding robot.And nearly two weeks ago, my daughter, Chloe, exchanged marriage vows with her charming and playful soulmate, Anton, in Pasadena. Anton wore custom, formal clown shoes with his Charlie Chaplin-inspired wedding suit.You might wonder: Are custom clown shoes really appropriate for a wedding?A rejuvenile wouldn’t think twice.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium. Piniella, who turns 81 next week, earned his fame in the Bronx as a two-time World Series champion but spent much of his managing career in a feisty rivalry with the YNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."
eugeneweekly_2023_37,"We ve got issues. There are people in our lives that pass through our day-to-day life like shadows. We may or may not notice their presence. We may or may not notice when they are missing. If we do notice the perceived change, we may meet it with curiosity or with a moment of inspection. Do we notice the energy it takes to have either experience? Everything we do either creates or expends energy, which in my perspective initiates connection, however large or small. Some connections may indicate a more tangible meaning and therefore have more focused energy in it, around it, through it, projected onto it. Those connections transform us in ways we may believe we can control. We may believe we can control them, especially if we dismiss the concept of quantum physics. My point is, we are all on this planet balancing energy. We give it and take it from each other. The energy is also infinite and without boundaries. Our five senses pick up energy in different modalities and give us stories colored with our personal and shared narratives. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. What does violence do to this shared energy? Where does bias come from when energy is shared? How does love change the same energy? There are experiments showing organisms changing under the influence of softer words, or soothing musical frequencies. What is the frequency we collectively live under? Is it louder than our individual frequency? How does it influence our individual frequency? When our frequency is grace, space, understanding and patience, where do you replenish your frequency? These questions are important because, collectively, we create the nervous system of our society, whether or not we normalize breathing or normalize holding our breath in fear. We normalize waiting the extra three seconds to allow someone to fumble and regain their steps without rushing them out of our way. We normalize the process of loss and of grief, not as an exception but an inevitable part of our day-to-day and our every day. We have life in common. We have human tendencies to rely on. When you don’t know what to say or do because someone is different from you in language, culture, religion, gender expression, ethnicity, beliefs, shapes, creeds, etc etc., know this: You are all human. We laugh, we cry, we create, we love, we are insecure, we are lonely, we are joyful, we are confident, we are lost, we are scared, we have lost, we have won, we have all been here.

suffolknewsherald_2023_50,"Published 4:37 pm Tuesday, May 9, 2023ByStaff ReportsThe American justice system has failed due to the lack of integrity among the magistrates and lawyers who prioritize serving mammon over the justice of natural law.The sincerity of the situation is that the rule of law is the confinements of the civil society and they must be honorable to work; but rather they are run as a good ole boys club or a donor’s favor list. While friendships are honorable, recent journalistic scrutiny of the close relationship between billionaire Harlan Crow and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas raises questions about the ethics of Supreme Court judges.However, our focus, here in the Hampton Roads, should be on the local magistrates and elected officials who represent our communities.In 2021, a George Soros-funded District Attorney named Ramin Fatehi was elected in Norfolk. Fatehi operates under Soros’s influence, who is part of a group of oligarchical warlords with the goal of shaping the wealth of nations to suit their image for world domination. Their aim is to potentially hand over sovereignty policy to the United Nations and policy influence the World Economic Forum, which have insinuated an allegiance to the eugenics philosophy proposed by Julian Huxley and his writing called UNESCO. This usurpation of power means that for anyone in the community who wants to hold a leadership office, they will have to embrace the intellectual power shift.The consequence of this shift is the rejection of individual freedom and the embrace of a one-world government controlled by a select few who hold the keys to the future industrial revolutions.According to Harvard historian Dr. Carroll Quigley, the downfall of American liberty is due to the liberal destroying the sustainable structure of the community for the sake of the individual, and the conservative destroying the government for the sake of the individual. As a result, the political power of America will fall into the private corporate hands of an oligarchic structure of elites playing the world as a chess game.To regain the American ideal, the first step is to remove law officers who see the independence of America as a hindering objection to obtaining world government.American leaders must focus on building sustainable communities that prioritize individual liberties.

philinquirer_2023_12,"In the election, Philly voters approved making the Office for People with Disabilities permanent. On Election Day, city votersapproved the permanent additionof the Office for People with Disabilities to the Philadelphia City Charter. Before the ballots were cast, this office, created by Mayor Jim Kenney in 2017, could have had its funding revoked at any time. Voting to make the office permanent is a critical and overdue step, demonstrating that disability rights are a priority for our city. This move is essential and overdue. It’s essential because Philadelphia’s population has thehighest rate of people living with disabilitiesamong large U.S. cities. It’s overdue because the Americans with Disabilities Rights Act (ADA was passed more than three decades ago. Ensuring ADA compliance throughout the city is a top priority for the office, which, at minimum, should guarantee that disability rights are protected in public spaces. This is a tall order for the now-permanent office, and there will certainly be an uphill climb for progress considering its 2024 annual budget of only $318,000 and roster of four full-time staffers. One way the office can protect and enhance the lives of Philadelphians living with disabilities is to work to remove some of the barriers to physical activity. Disability rights are civil rights, and these freedoms are inextricably linked to physical activity. Disability rights are civil rights. As a physical therapist and researcher, I advocate for movement as a right every day. To be alive is to move, from the cells in our body to our fingers and toes. While dreaded by some, physical activity is necessary for all aspects of health, including bones, muscles, skin, and brain. It protects us against disease and improves our quality of life. For people with disabilities, a lack of physical activity can only exacerbate any existing issues. This is a significant problem, as nearly half of adults with disabilitiesdon’t get to experience regular physical activity. This statistic has a cascade of consequences, leaving people with disabilities at higher risk for several chronic health conditions. What’s more, being inactive doesn’t feel good — it decreases your quality of life, and limits your social participation. This is a health equity issue that is at the heart of all disability rights conversations. There are several obstacles that prevent people with disabilities from regular physical activity. The most significant barriers are social and structural. The ADA made equitable access to all public spaces law in 1990. Yet Philadelphia, alongside many other American cities, leaves much to be desired on this front. Crumbling sidewalks, broken subway elevators, missing curb ramps, and inaccessible housing are found throughout the city. Philadelphia has done so poorly by its disabled residents, in fact, that the city hasbeen sued for failing to comply with accessibility laws; as a result, the city agreed to a 15-year plan to install or fix at least 10,000 sidewalk curb ramps. A lesser-known accessibility issue is embedded in the historic nature of our beloved city. In the centuries since the founding fathers walked across our cobblestone streets,city officials have givenhistorical register designations to hundreds of buildings. As written, the ADA allows for an unfortunate loophole that permits designated historical buildings to keep architectural barriers if accessible design isnot “readily achievable” for a number of reasons, such as cost. This cost, of course, often comes at the price of people with disabilities who cannot enjoy these spaces. » READ MORE:I’m disabled. The law says I deserve access to venues, so why do they charge me double? When history is reserved for those without disabilities, our future is also being made without themin mind. Further, disability is intersectional — meaning a person living with a disability is not only living with a disability. Coined bycivil rights advocate and scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, intersectionality sheds light on social identities and their compounding impact on an individual’s level of discrimination. Living with a disability is just one identity that increases social risk. People with disabilities who are older, from communities of color, from LGBTQ communities, and/or of low socioeconomic status are at an increased risk for discrimination. It’s easy to see how disadvantages could compound. Consider, for example, a recent report that showed that Philadelphia’s Black workers spent34 more minutes per weekcommuting than white workers. Now, consider the added difficulties faced by a commuting Black worker who is also a wheelchair user. Additionally, Philadelphia — the nation’s poorest large city — happens to be home to some of the country’s mostdisadvantaged neighborhoods, places marked by poor housing, poverty, struggling schools, and unemployment. Research shows that living in these areas is associated withhigher rates of chronic health conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which can be prevented and managed by regular physical activity. Many of the people living in Philly’s disadvantaged neighborhoods have disabilities. Again, it’s easy to see how these disadvantages can compound. The Office for People with Disabilities should take advantage of this moment, of the mandate given to them by Philadelphia voters in the most recent election. It can use this moment — this mandate — to push the city to accelerate its timetable to fix its curb cuts, to encourage historic buildings to make themselves accessible to all Philadelphians, and reach out to the people with disabilities who are facing additional challenges related to race, poverty, and other factors. If we are to ensure all Philadelphians have the right to participate in their communities, then we must prioritize this office and its commitment to disability rights. It is a legal and moral obligation to ensure health, happiness, and the pursuit of movement freedom for all. Laura A. Baehr is an assistant professor of health and rehabilitation sciences at the College of Public Health at Temple University. Her research, clinical work, and community education have focused on promoting physical activity in people living with chronic physical disabilities."

Likewise, we have dedicated people and organizations (civilian and military, religious and secular in our midst that actively (and politically help and support our senior citizens who have contributed to and continue to make a difference to the United States and the world, and who continue to try to enjoy the rest of their life struggling or fighting their battle for survival.In revelation, I’m one of those million Americans who have been dealing or living with chronic lower back pain, aching body, muscles, and joint pain. Like others, it’s a daily struggle managing it, with or without prescribed medications, and workouts or simple physical conditioning or exercises, subject to the body’s ability and capability.On the other hand, my faith in Jesus, our Lord God and Savior, keeps me going in life. With my unquestionable faith, I always pray, “Thank you, Jesus; thank you, God.” As always, I offer my pain and suffering, joy and sorrow to Jesus. I pray, “Jesus, I believe and trust in You.”Having been a member of the AARP for years, I get to be informed monthly or periodically about issues and concerns that pertain to us members. With publications like AARP Bulletin and AARP The Magazine on hand, I continue to obtain knowledge and information, to be empowered and entertained, while learning many things that affect and impact us senior citizens.Issues about jobs, travel, fitness, investing, health care, government and political entertainment have been discussed or talked about in the publications mentioned above, in addition to other concerns like extreme weather, COVID-19, tick-borne diseases, Alzheimer’s disease and research, aging knees, a new cancer concern for men, marriage and mental health, on money matters, bad drivers, food poisoning, home repair rip-offs and crazy utility bills, taxes, how to beat inflation, great ways to save, the brave New World of shopping, fraud survival guide and many more topics that are interesting, challenging, and entertaining.Browsing through my old copies of AARP publications recently, I learned that October is Health Literacy Month. What does that mean, especially for us seniors? Well, we must know and learn about our health and well-being. There are topics by contributing writers that inform us about prevention and early detection of such diseases, medical reports, and the latest promising developments in cancer and Alzheimer’s research.Despite our health conditions, we can all learn something that benefits us, especially when dealing with physical, mental, and social health. Let’s avail ourselves of all useful information, whether in print or digital. It’s up to us to empower ourselves to help keep us as healthy and safe as possible.It’s true that as we age, hopefully and prayerfully, with grace and wisdom, we have much more to learn, know, say, and do as we battle and grapple with life’s changes and challenges.We believe we have a blessed, holy life here and after with our faith in the Trinity or Triune God (God the Father, God the Son Jesus Christ, and God the Holy Spirit .As we journey through life, we continue to have faith and deepen and grow in our faith. We pray, “Jesus, I trust in You,” always. We believe Jesus is God incarnate, “true God and true man,” born of the Blessed Virgin Mary, by the power of the Holy Spirit. Hence, Jesus, our Lord God, Savior and Redeemer, was fully divine and human. In John 10:30, we read, “I and the Father are One.” Jesus and God the Father are one, the same in essence, same power, same nature, and same intentions that is for all of us, sinners and saints, to be saved from our sins and transgressions and have life everlasting.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_156,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Former President Ronald Reagan once noted, “No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size.” That’s true, which is why what’s currently happening with Medicaid is so remarkable.During the pandemic, Medicaid enrollment grew dramatically because the federal government tied increased emergency funding to a provision that prevented states from removing ineligible individuals from the rolls. Earlier this year, Medicaid enrollment ballooned from 65 million people to more than 94 million. That’s more than a quarter of the country’s population.So much for Medicaid being coverage of last resort for the neediest.Reagan foresaw that outcome. The rest of his above quote states, “Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we’ll ever see on this Earth.”To prove his point, the White House kept renewing the emergency order even as the pandemic faded. This was a backdoor effort to permanently expand Medicaid.But Republicans in December 2022 rescinded the continuous coverage mandate, forcing states to disenroll those who were improperly using Medicaid. Progressives — eager to see more Americans become government dependent — warned that enforcing eligibility requirements would lead to a massive spike in the uninsured.That hasn’t happened.As The Wall Street Journal noted in August, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected a less than 1 percentage point increase in the number of uninsured Americans once the pandemic emergency provisions expired.“Although Medicaid enrollment is expected to decrease significantly,” CMS concluded, “many individuals who were not disenrolled from Medicaid during the public health emergency already had comprehensive coverage from another source (such as through an employer and thus remain insured even when disenrolled from Medicaid.”The process is working. Already more than 11 million people have been disenrolled. In Nevada, 176,000 people have been dropped, while around 273,000 have had their coverage renewed. Again, enrollment standards haven’t changed. States are now simply confirming eligibility and removing those who no longer qualify.In addition, there are safeguards in place — an appeals process, retroactive coverage — for those inaccurately removed from Medicaid because of bureaucratic snafus.If Democrats want a debate about expanding this entitlement program, fine. But etching “temporary” pandemic emergency provisions in stone isn’t the way to go about it.Cleaning the rolls by enforcing eligibility provisions will, reason.com noted, save taxpayers an estimated $80 billion annually.Even for the government, that’s real money.—Las Vegas Review-Journal/TNS"

For the second straight month, home sale prices set a record in Hampton Roads in June with a median transaction of $345,000, up from the prior record of $335,000 in May.That’s according to the Real Estate Information Network, which tracks such data on behalf of Realtors and other stakeholders in the region.Record home values are certainly good for sellers, but not necessarily good for the real estate economy, which continues to be dragged down by low inventory.REIN makes a calculation called Months’ Supply of Inventory, or MSI, which for June was 1.47, up both month-over-month from 1.37 in May, and year-over-year from 1.33 in June 2022. The calculation is total active listings for a month divided by the “absorption rate,” which is the total number of listings sold over the preceding 12-month period, then divided by 12.“The MSI is up mainly due to slowing sales, which in itself is being impacted by a lack of inventory causing price increases,” said Jon McAchran of AtCoastal Realty and president of REIN’s Board of Directors.”Still, all things considered, “the Hampton Roads market is much healthier and more robust than markets in many other parts of Virginia and the United States,” McAchran said.Other numbers of interest from June:On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

While it’s easy to get citizens to fill the room for a public hearing on a controversial rezoning or conditional-use permit, citizen engagement is much less robust when it comes time for a community to update its comprehensive plan — arguably the time to have a much more meaningful impact on land-use decisions.Now is that time.Suffolk leaders are working on the first update of the community’s comprehensive plan in seven years. The 20-year plan, dubbed Suffolk 2045, will be a long-range guide for a number of strategic areas, including land use, housing, transportation, parks and open spaces, public safety, schools and economic development.To their credit, officials are actively seeking participation from the citizenry. The first of seven “community engagement sessions” was held Tuesday night at City Hall. Others are planned for Thursday at Southwestern Elementary School, Feb. 9 at the Chuckatuck Fire Department, Feb. 14 at John Yeates Middle School, Feb. 16 at Nansemond River High School, Feb. 23 at Col. Fred Cherry Middle School and Feb. 28 at the Curtis R. Milteer, Sr. Recreation Center. All start at 6 p.m.Citizens can talk about any related topic, but officials say they especially want to hear feedback on planning and coordinating approaches for residential and commercial development; managing the impacts of increased residential development; mitigating traffic congestion and improving roads; maintaining Suffolk’s rural heritage and small-town feel; creating downtown investment and revitalization; and incorporating open space, parks, entertainment, restaurants, recreation and retail opportunities.For the many citizens angry about City Council approval of the Port 460 warehousing complex, now is the time to show up and say unequivocally to city leaders: No more warehouses. Suffolk must immediately pivot to a more creative, innovative, lucrative and less burdensome strategy for economic development and job creation.Suffolk 2045 is the perfect document in which to say no to warehouses and yes to a brighter future for our city.

(In this decked hall, you also find engraved on the stone wall a quote from the manger-born himself, “And ye shall know the truth and the truth will make you free.”— John 8:32 As you journey deeper into the corridors, you encounter doors to restricted areas decorated with Christmas wrapping, bows, ornaments and all manner of 3D holiday-themed crafts.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_83,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°On Thursday, a vehicle trolled around Harvard Square bearing screens with the names and likenesses of some of the Harvard University students who had signed on to a public statement blaming Israel for the brutal attacks on civilian families within its own borders. Earlier, Bill Ackman, the billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, had said that other CEOs in his sector had asked for the names of the students, lest one of them “inadvertently hire one of them.”Tempting as it surely was for those infuriated by the students’ naivete, we don’t condone any of that public shaming of young people who are still formulating mature political opinions and the expression thereof, and who may not have even fully known what was going out in their name on social media. It’s un-American.But when it comes to administrators, that’s a different matter. Last week, universities as a group overwhelmingly failed to condemn the unspeakable Hamas attacks, instead mostly offering mealy-mouthed statements that did not so much support their own Jewish students in their hour of extraordinary need as anger and upset them. Very few administrators intuited the echoes of the Holocaust pouring out of tablets and phones on their campuses; or, if they did, they were scared to say so.Most would have been better saying nothing, although college presidents now feel pressure to make statements about everything in the outside world, lest they be criticized for silence.For the last few years, colleges have been able to issue anodyne progressive statements designed not so much to lead as to follow, and Israel has been part of a crude post-colonialist narrative that has taken hold on many campuses and become the only acceptable point of view.Within the last few days, those in administration buildings, as well as those in residence halls, have discovered that, in times like these, when figures they have deemed sympathetic are slaughtering civilians in their own homes, there are consequences for merely parroting that reductive line of thinking. Especially when many of the dead were themselves left-wingers, highly critical of the Israeli government.Yes, donors got upset. Yes, buildings might not now get built. Yes, people who make ill-timed statements and throw them to the wind might find it has quickly blown them back in their faces.Yes, employers might think twice about whether a job candidate shares their values. Free speech goes both ways.And last week, some well-paying law firms and Wall Street entities woke up, said they had their limits and that blaming Israel for the slaughter of its own innocents exceeded them.They have that right and students now should be protected from harm but given a chance to absorb that painful lesson.—Chicago Tribune Editorial Board/TNSHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

The package hidden underneath it, trash. And the gift itself, in most cases, future trash, given enough time.Too harsh? Then ask yourself: Do you remember much of what you got last Christmas?Though I’d wager the answer is no, I’d also bet you do remember something: who gave you a present, and the love you felt because of it. Like it or not, giving our friends and family stuff between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day is one of the most important bonding rituals we have.This is why my instinctive “don’t get me anything” response won’t work when my wife, my mother-in-law and even my children ask what I want for Christmas. My late Norwegian grandparents, who spent much of their childhood under Nazi occupation, appreciated this kind of conspicuous frugality, but to American ears, “Don’t get me anything” sounds like “I want a divorce.”So in the interest of domestic harmony, I try to keep the monologues about presents being just future trash — and the planes ferrying them across the country, the delivery trucks shuttling them to our doorsteps, the gas burned driving to mall parking lots, good God don’t get me started — to myself.My wife puts a lot of thought into her gift-giving, and my children beam when they get something in the mail from their great-grandparents. I respect that — no matter how intractable our trash problem has become.And it is a monstrous problem, especially around Christmas. By one estimate, we generate more than 25% of our annual waste during the holidays. That might be tolerable in a more conservation-minded society, but the typical American already produces nearly one ton of garbage per year.We’ve created a civilization bursting at the seams with stuff, and the holidays merely see the worst of it. In the city we see overflowing trash bins and roadside litter, but those of us who wander in our mountains and deserts find indestructible plastic and food containers tangled in brush, miles away from the nearest convenience store or fast-food restaurant.Even along some high-altitude trails in the San Gabriel Mountains, I’ve seen chaparral and pine groves that double as balloon graveyards, their branches ensnaring the inflated Mylar and latex that routinely escape suburban birthday parties. The more stuff we produce, the more the dregs of our daily lives find their way far beyond our urban boundaries.Aware of this, I shop for gifts locally and buy with waste reduction in mind, two habits that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggests for shoppers looking to shrink their garbage footprints.

Friday nights bring out families and students from all over the community to watch two schools battle it out on the gridiron.When we step foot inside the gates of our local stadiums, we don’t typically worry about our safety, only the safety of those participating in the game. Injuries are a part of the sport. They are not, however, part of being a spectator. Likewise, the threat of violence against players and coaches should also not be of any concern during the course of the game.So far this season, several games have been marred by chaos caused by threats of gun violence or actual gun violence.On Friday, Aug. 18, in Jacksonville, Florida, police shot and wounded a 16-year-old, who they said fired a gun into a crowd leaving the First Coast vs. Ribault high school football game when it was called off in the third quarter.On Thursday, Aug. 24, right here in the Hampton Roads area, shots were fired outside of the Kempsville vs. Green Run, and while this did not occur inside the stadium, it created chaos within the stadium, and the game was ultimately suspended. Two individuals were injured in that incident.On Friday, Aug. 25, a video emerged from Columbus, Georgia, of players and referees diving to the turf during the Heritage Classic game between Carver High School and Spencer High School. Three juveniles were arrested outside AJ McClung Stadium on weapons charges. On Wednesday, Muscogee County School District announced no varsity football games would be held at the stadium for the remainder of the season due to its inability to adequately staff the stadium to provide a safe environment.Also on Friday, Aug. 25, in Choctaw, Oklahoma, a 16-year-old died as a result of a gunshot that occurred during the third quarter of the Choctaw vs. Dell City football game. Three others were also injured in the incident. As of this writing, no arrests have been made, however, two firearms and eight rounds were confiscated on the scene, according to the Choctaw Police Department.Also on Aug. 25 in South Los Angeles, a staff member of Maya Angelou Community College was wounded by a gunshot while on the sidelines of a football game. According to police, the woman was struck by a stray bullet that was fired in the vicinity of the football stadium.Five shooting incidents in and around high school football games, and we are only in the second week of football for some. A cause for concern, for sure.Many school districts have begun to revise policies to include clear bags and those with resources will be including weapon detection systems at stadium gates.Suffolk City Public Schools did not wait for these incidents to occur. They have been proactive for many years having weapon detection systems in place to maintain the safety of players and spectators. It is a measure that we may take for granted, but one that should be commended.The value placed on life has dwindled and we as a society need to change that.These measures are not the be-all and end-all, however, it is a great step to ensure the safety of the fans and participants.The hope is these incidents are not a sign of things to come this year but simply isolated incidents that took place around the same time. Football is a time to gather as fans and cheer on our student-athletes, celebrate our alma maters and we should not have to worry about whether violence will erupt.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2023_3,"Dear Oracle,My sister and her husband had two children under the age of four. While I know my brother-in-law LOVES his kids and tries to be a good dad, he doesn’t do a lot of things that I think fall under “parent duty,” which is making my sister very overwhelmed and resentful. I know they’ve talked about it, he’s made excuses, and she’s just accepted that it’s the way things are. But she calls every day to complain, and I don’t know what advice to offer her. I don’t know what it’s like to be a parent, but I do know what it’s like to be married. How can I talk to her and tell her that something has to change?--Sisterly ConcernCards: King of Cups, Queen of Cups (rev. , Knight of Pentacles, The Hermit (rev. , Ten of Pentacles (rev. Dear Sister,As someone with a sister and strong “let-me-help-you-with-that” genes, I absolutely understand your impulse to help your sister through this tough time. Parenthood can strain even the most solidly built relationships and widen cracks that were already showing. However, to paraphrase Tolstoy, I think this unhappy marriage is unique. While you can certainly sympathize, you admit that you aren’t a parent, which is an integral part of this dynamic and might create some blind spots for you.That being said, I think you re reading the situation correctly. I think your brother-in-law, as the King of Cups,very muchloves his children and his wife and has the best of intentions when it comes to being a loving father. But, with the reversed Queen of Cups, I don’t think he’s clocking that his relationship with his wife — who is also doing her damnedest to be a good mother — is suffering. The good news is I think there is a lot of love here, which hopefully means both will be willing to work on their relationship.Since toddlers are lovable little agents of chaos, it’s no surprise to see the Knight of Pentacles here, on top of his wild horse from hell. In this instance, I think you need to be your sister’s calm, cool-headed knight. Her world might feel upside-down right now (toddlers can cause this on their own, without the additional marital drama , and having just a calm anchor to vent to might be one of her few lifelines.I think your sister is turning to you because she needs people to talk to, but I don’t think you can be the person to tell her that things need to change — one, because I don’t think she’ll hear it coming from you. The relationship between sisters is unique, and communication can be fraught at times. What would sound like a valid concern coming from a friend might sound like a criticism coming from a sister. (To be fair to her, telling your sister her marriage needs to changeisa criticism. The second reason I don’t think you can tell her to change things is that this is a marriage and a family unit that you are not a part of. In order for change to happen in this marriage, both parties have to want it. They have to be the ones who see that something is wrong and decide to fix it.This doesn’t mean your hands are tied. On the contrary, as the calm Knight of Pentacles, I think you can be a voice of reason and encourage your sister and her husband to seek professional help.There is an element of divine knowledge with The Hermit, which can be about connecting to a source of wisdom outside of yourself. In this case, it might be a family/marriage counselor.A professional will also be able to help them see a variety of different options and have more answers than the casual observer because they’ll be able to get a fuller picture and have the experience to suggest things that may not occur to you.A professional has the advantage of clinical distance, so they can make observations that don’t sound like judgments (which is not often the case for family members . If your brother-in-law is slacking off, a therapist can tell him to cut that shit out in a helpful way and then work with him on ways he can step up.I do think your sister and brother-in-law can work this out. The Ten of Pentacles is a card of family legacy and the reward after hard labor. But again, this is their issue to work out.I know how hard it can be to sit out and watch someone we love struggle, especially if we think there’s a simple answer. But the truth is, the answer is rarely simple. Your sister’s marriage and family dynamic has many dimensions to it, and in order for real improvement to happen, it has to come from within.Which, again, I think is likely. For now, you can be compassionate with your sister while also setting some boundaries (maybe no more than three vent-calls a week? and encourage her when you can. Life in the country is incredibly stressful for parents, and no one wants to feel like their partner isn’t stepping up. Tell her what a good job she’s doing. If you live close by and are able to, perhaps offer to watch the kids so they can go to therapy or have a date night or do whatever. If you don’t, maybe provide support in other ways (Uber Eats gift card? Instacarting groceries to their house? that help make parenting a little easier. Hopefully, things work out.But keep being that calm knight, even if nothing changes, and the resentment grows, therapy fails, and they end up divorced. In the worst-case scenario, you can be your sister’s port in the storm, and you can provide a safe haven for her and the kids, emotionally or physically speaking.Just don’t say, “I told you so.” Sisters hate that shit.

Ok … Today’s subject: The Great Dismal Swamp … Hope you completed your homework.Recently, the Great Dismal Swamp Wildlife Refuge staff asked if we would be a part of a group of volunteers to visit fourth-grade classes in Suffolk Public Schools as part of a program to “boost hands-on learning,” sharing a presentation about the Swamp. This project was a long time in the making collaboration between The Great Dismal Swamp Wildlife Refuge, Suffolk Public Schools, and The Friends of the Great Dismal Swamp to support the 4th grade curriculum. This massive undertaking delivered the program to all 11 elementary schools, totaling 44 fourth-grade classes in Suffolk (about 1,100 students in support of their SOLs, which include the History, Geography, and Ecology of the swamp, the people that lived and worked there and used its resources.Chris Lowie, GDSWR Refuge Manager and Susan Stanley, wildlife biologist, and their team created a wonderful slide presentation for the students and a training tool for the volunteers. After our training session and a “what have we gotten ourselves into now moment,” we were off to our assignment: Mrs. Langston’s 4th-grade class. We’ve got this, we have grandchildren in 4th grade and roughly 60 years of teaching experience between us … piece of cake … we told ourselves.We were delivered to Mrs. Langston’s room. There they were … 26 of them … all in their places with bright, shiny, 4th grade faces. Our deer in the headlights anxiety melted into sheer delight. The room was orderly and cheerful. The students were attentive and engaged. This is the mark of a master teacher.We brought with us a good assortment of deer antlers, turtle shells, snake skins, turkey feathers, etc. The students’ polite quietness turned into a buzz of anticipation. We were off to a good start.The SOLs in the 4th grade cover Virginia’s geography, history, as well as scientific topics. These students were prepared. They knew about the Piedmont and could distinguish it from the Coastal Plain; they knew who George Washington was and that he had connections to Suffolk. And they loved seeing slides of the animals that live in the swamp.So we dove into the topography, history, plants and animals. Their politeness turned into active interest, with raised hands everywhere. They recognized the Turkey feathers we brought, some had been to Lake Drummond, and they knew about the Indigenous people and freedom seekers that resided in the dense forest of the swamp. Flowers. Butterflies.Mammals. Reptiles! They loved the subject matter; we just delivered it to them. As the hour came to an end, we were posed for a picture by Mrs. Langston, holding the Swamp treasures. I hope she treasures the picture as much as we do. What a delightful time we had, and the students did, too! Mrs. Langston’s classroomwas a perfect setting and her students were perfectly behaved. Kudos to her. But mainly, congratulations to the students, who were attentive, respectful, willing to share their experiences and listen to ours.So, if you think you are smarter than a 4th grader, take it from two old dinosaurs that taught during the Dark Ages of mimeograph machines and chalkboards … everything in today’s classroom is smart, even the chalkboard, but especially the students.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_178,"Published 3:57 pm Tuesday, October 10, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldIn 1964, a one-minute television ad changed the landscape of U.S. politics forever. The ad, commonly referred to as the ‘Daisy Girl’ ad, portrayed a young girl counting while picking a daisy’s petals and counting each petal as she pulls it off the stem. As the girl pulled the final petal, a mission control-like countdown replaced her words and was followed by a giant nuclear explosion and the classic mushroom cloud.The advertisement was a campaign ad aimed at Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, portraying him as a maniac who threatened the world’s future.Two months after the advertisement aired for the first and only time, President Lyndon Johnson won easily, and the visceral political attack ad was born. The impression is that the ad won the election for Johnson. However, by the time this ad ran, there was a very slim chance Goldwater was going to win the election, and ‘Daisy Girl’ was credited for assuring the victory.Nearly 60 years later, we are still in the midst of negative political campaign ads. These ads continue to fill our traditional media spaces regularly, and in the age of target marketing online, our computer and phone screens as well.The average person will tell you they dislike negative campaign ads. However, research shows these ads are effective because they elicit supporters’ reactions. Although they may elicit a reaction and motivate someone to vote for one candidate or another, what they do not do is provide voters with reasons why they should vote for one candidate over another and potentially lead emotionally uninformed voters to the polls. Voting with your emotions is akin to standing in line at the grocery store and picking up a tabloid magazine simply because you saw a great photo and catchy title. Neither of those tells the true story, and once you immerse yourself in that story, it may turn out to be something other than what you expected.Being informed includes attending candidate forums, which in some cases, showcase the differences between candidates – assuming they all participate.As early voting has already begun in Virginia and the negative ads continue to flow, we hope that each active voter takes the time to learn more about each candidate on the ballot. Being an informed voter is just as important as casting the vote itself.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_197,"Published 4:57 pm Tuesday, September 12, 2023ByJen JaquaTechnology and education advances were the highlights of 1987 and ’88. In February of 1987, the City Council took a big step in expanding citizen participation in government. The unblinking eyes of Suffolk Cablevision’s cameras were upon the city council as its first February session became its first-ever televised meeting. TV cameras from Suffolk Cablevision monitored the happenings of the council as it addressed issues new and old on Channel 13.Brandon House Furniture and the American Cancer Society sponsored a fundraising challenge at the end of February. Highlights of the challenge included Pee-wee Herman underwear and a rock-a-thon. The event took place in the front display window of Brandon House Furniture. The rocker who raised the most money and rocked the entire 24 hours received a rocking chair from the store. As for Pee-wee’s underwear, the public was encouraged to send in bids for that delightful item and several others through a “Silent Auction.”In late May, the traditionally male Rotary Clubs of Suffolk faced the prospect of having local women join their ranks due to a Supreme Court decision. “‘I haven’t heard of any women who want to join yet,’ Richard Turner, president of the North Suffolk Rotary Club, said. ‘I think there is a place for both. Only time will tell how it will work.’ The North Suffolk and Suffolk Rotary Clubs are the two local clubs linked with the international service organization. ‘It should be emphasized that the purpose of the Rotary Club is not a select group of people getting together to socialize,’ Turner said. ‘But it’s ‘service above self.’ That’s our motto. We are concerned with local and national needs of people.’”A scramble by parents and guardians began in October 1987 thanks to a new federal tax law requiring them to show Social Security numbers for dependents five years and older when claiming them as dependents on tax forms. The scramble was a result of the necessity to obtain a Social Security card. According to a survey earlier in ’87, only 16 percent of Virginians have obtained a Social Security number for their children. But Suffolkians had obtained Social Security cards for about 75% of Suffolk youth.On Sept. 21, 1988, lottery sales legally began in Virginia.In October 1988, after seven years of discussion and bargaining, the School Board and City Council came together to break ground for the city’s two new high schools. The ceremony was held first at the Nansemond River High School site at Nansemond Parkway and Sleepy Hole Road, where bulldozers had just begun leveling the ground. Then it was on to the Lakeland High School site on Kenyon Road, where a farmer, who leased the property from the former owner, was completing his peanut harvest.1988 finished with the City Council voting to appropriate $117,000 to buy computers, printers, and satellite dishes for use in Suffolk’s public high schools.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_140,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Trashing labor unions, in particular teachers unions, has become a talking point for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on the presidential trail. He told California Gov. Gavin Newsom during their Fox News debate that Democrats are “owned lock, stock and barrel, by the teachers union.”What does that look on the ground, when laws DeSantis signed singling out some types of public-sector unions start to take effect?The results may be upwards of 30,000 school employees being left without representation to bargain for better pay and working conditions.The state’s largest teachers union, United Teachers of Dade, is close to decertification thanks to a new law that requires unions have at least 60% of union members pay dues, the Herald reported. The law — Senate Bill 256 — was a union-busting one-two-punch that not only raised the threshold for certification from 50%, but also prohibited unions from deducting dues directly from members’ paychecks. UTD, which represents teachers in the state’s biggest school district in Miami-Dade County, has gained 800 new members, but still failed to meet the state’s stringent requirements. In November, the Herald reported union membership was at 58.4%.The Republican anti-union spiel usually leaves out the fact that Florida, unlike many blue states, is among 26 states that have “right to work” laws. That means workers cannot be forced to join a union and pay dues as a condition of employment. In other words, teachers and school staff do not have to be part of United Teachers of Dade to benefit from the 7% to 10% pay raise the union negotiated with the school district this year,Teacher unions became a preferred target of DeSantis during his fight to reopen schools during the pandemic and to eliminate anything he deems “woke” indoctrination in schools. The governor has gone even further by demonizing teachers, who have been muzzled on what they say about race and LGBTQ issues in the classroom.Unions, like all organizations, have had very public shortcomings, such as protecting bad employees from accountability. But if we’re talking about unions that are too powerful, we cannot leave out police and firefighter unions, whose endorsements DeSantis and other Republican gladly accept. It turns out SB 256 exempted those unions — along with those representing corrections officers — from that 60% threshold requirement.In other words, the law affects organizations that have directly clashed with DeSantis and the Republican-led Legislature. United Teachers of Dade was among the most vocal groups pushing back against the parental-rights law critics call “Don’t say gay,” laws that made it easier for organizations like Moms for Liberty to push schools to ban books, and DeSantis’ infamous “Stop Woke Act,” which bans instructions that some may interpret as making students feel guilty about being white. UTD President Karla Hernandez-Mats ran against DeSantis in 2022 as Charlie Crist’s running mate.Meanwhile, groups like the Police Benevolent Association, the largest police union in the state, have been in lockstep with Republicans. In June, the PBA endorsed DeSantis for president, despite supporting Donald Trump in 2020.Masked as a measure to hold unions accountable, SB 256 was a version of the same kind of political payback Disney received when it opposed the “Don’t say gay” law.This is exactly the type of pain the new state law appears to seek to inflict. In Florida, opposition to the party in power comes with a high cost.— The Miami Herald"
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_137,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°(Zimmytws/Dreamstime/TNS If you’ve ordered a coffee and been asked to tip your barista at Starbucks and hesitated, you’re not alone: If you don’t tip, will your chipper barista be let down? What does everyone else do?This was the subject of a fascinating new study by the Pew Research Center, which created an interactive fictional American town, “Tipping Point,” that asks users how they’d tip in various situations and then lets you see how your answers compare to others.The survey is timely: Establishments requiring or asking for tips has increased. If I’m at a business and an employee hands me an iPad, I know I’m about to be asked to tip them on something.According to Pew, 72% of U.S. adults say that tipping is expected in more places today than it was five years ago.Tipping used to be based on service excellence. If a waiter was prompt, attentive and polite, that person earned a 20% tip. Now, large parties at more expensive restaurants will find that a 20% tip has been automatically added to their check, regardless of service.If everyone gets a trophy for being on the team, why shouldn’t every establishment at least offer — if not expect — their employees to receive tips on their service, even if you do all the work? I’ve gone to some stores where I’ve done all the shopping myself, gone to the counter to pay for the items with my own money, and still been asked to tip. What am I paying for? Just the fact that the business exists? It seems like tipping culture is removing incentives for employees to do their best.In this tough economy, it’s easy to see why establishments at least ask for tips. Times are hard for everyone and a lot of people — particularly Americans — are generous. Still, it’s difficult to reward establishments just for existing and especially for subpar service.Understandably, Americans are torn about the new tipping culture they find themselves in. About 45% say they still tip based on specific situations and 40% oppose suggested tip amounts, the Pew report found.Recently, a viral TikTok and YouTube video showed a driver delivering $400 worth of food. When she realizes she isn’t getting tipped, she says she’ll keep the food her customer ordered. Reactions online were mixed but many people commented that the driver is already getting paid by the app to deliver food and a tip would have been a bonus, not an expectation.Employees might appreciate devices that at least encourage patrons to tip, but unfortunately, it doesn’t appear to have succeeded. Adults in the survey said they tip because it’s an obligation, and the industry that earned the most tips was still sit-down restaurants, followed by haircuts, food delivery services and purchasing a drink at a bar. Just 43% of Americans always tip when using a taxi or Uber, and a mere 12% always tip at a coffee shop.The holidays are a time to be generous, but it’s also important for society to reward a job well done. Tips should be earned, not expected. Yet people should also be generous when given the chance.Americans spending their dollars must make this choice wisely, especially now that anyone can leave a tip just about anywhere.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."

His participation in the WEF and CFR indicates his engagement with global economic and political matters, which can raise questions about his motives.In 2020, Youngkin represented the American economic sector at the World Economic Forum’s policy dissemination through various panels. Some panels favored a global order at the expense of national sovereignty, conflicting with America’s values of individual liberty and state sovereignty. However, Youngkin defended the American economy and ideals during these panels, highlighting robust labor markets, capital markets, rule of law, and a culture of innovation as factors that make America outperform the world. He emphasized the importance of confidence in regulatory frameworks and policies for the U.S. expansion.Youngkin has demonstrated intellectual prowess, leadership and patriotism. He has stood firm against global pressures, reminiscent of historical figures such as Patrick Henry, symbolizing American resilience and independence.As he potentially seeks presidential power, he must be cautious about his inner circle and avoid aligning himself with globalist agendas. Scholars advise him to be wary of the influence of institutions such as the CFR, which some argue were established with the intention of gaining British control over America. It is crucial for him to reject such influences and embrace diverse American grass-rooted leadership.The mentioned groups, including the CFR, WEF, and Bilderberg group, have embedded themselves in the United States and promote global governance, potentially undermining American sovereignty. Youngkin should reject their influence and prioritize community-level sovereignty, which can foster sustainability and preserve people’s liberties.The United States should not embrace the jurisdiction of the United Nations, especially at the cost of unnecessary wars. Instead, it should focus on supporting neighboring countries like Mexico, Brazil and Canada rather than distant European powers.The American Revolution of 1776 was a declaration of independence from European control, and it is vital to safeguard that freedom by being cautious of global influences. The next leader must be an American leader, not swayed by foreign governments or establishments that do not prioritize the American people.Youngkin has the opportunity to be a true statesman, revolutionizing the country and standing for true statecraft.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_160,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In a federal indictment this week, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams unveiled an indictment against Nikhil Gupta, an alleged Indian narcotics trafficker who prosecutors say had attempted to hire a hitman— who turned out to be an undercover federal agent — to assassinate Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a U.S. citizen. The feds say Gupta, who was arrested in the Czech Republic, was directed by a senior Indian government official.The details sound like something out of a spy novel, but in the real world there are no suave super-spies in tailored suits always ready to save the day.Just a couple of months ago, Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was assassinated in British Columbia, after which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the Canadian government was investigating potential ties between the killing and the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. That accusation and the subsequent diplomatic turmoil shocked the world, but now twice is a pattern.In this case, while the specific Indian official who is alleged to have ordered the assassination is not identified, the U.S. intelligence services apparently have direct communications between Mr. X and Gupta, including the directive that Pannun’s murder was “a priority now.” Gupta also allegedly told the undercover that Nijjar’s murder was part of the same operation and that “we have so many targets.” The international community should ensure that Nijjar is the last.The long tendrils of right-wing authoritarianism are spreading across the world, far outside the borders of the strongmen themselves. It’s certainly not the first time in modern history that despots have directed killings and abductions well beyond their putative jurisdictions, but the brazenness is only getting worse, an indication of the extent to which these figures feel unconstrained by international consequences.Vladimir Putin, whose disastrous and fortunately unsuccessful invasion of Ukraine has dragged on for almost two years now, has become known for taking out his critics in absurd pseudo-accidents or outright gruesome executions no matter where they are.Not that dictators killing their opposition domestically is acceptable; the general project of political violence and demonization that seems to be progressing around the globe, including in the United States, portends dark days ahead. Still, it is especially galling for these antidemocratic factions to reach around the globe to the places where democracy is holding on and assert their authoritarian power.These operations don’t just target one person or group, they target the whole of the liberal project and the the very principles of freedom of expression and political organization, sending the message that no matter where you are, you should be looking over your shoulder if you have too stringently criticized a certain regime.The only way this stops is if it becomes clear to those regimes that they also won’t be safe from the blowback. The Biden administration is right to have impressed on India that this would not be tolerated, dispatching the CIA director to deliver the message.Hopefully, the president will make this a consistent policy, and outline heavy consequences for all governments that would cross this line, including our pals the Saudis.

suffolknewsherald_2023_89,"Published 5:56 pm Friday, March 24, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardWe editorialized in this space for legalization of casino gambling and sports betting in Virginia, and both are off and running, including the opening of a casino in neighboring Portsmouth and another on the way in Norfolk.We cautioned at the time that there would be downsides, and this is a good time to again acknowledge them.March is Problem Gambling Awareness Month, and, not surprisingly with betting much simpler and accessible than it used to be, the problem has worsened in recent years. Calls to the Virginia Council on Problem Gambling’s helpline increased 56.7% from 2021 to 2022.Nearly two-thirds of the callers were men, with 23.4% in the 25-35 age range, when gambling addiction is especially harmful to young families.Problem Gambling Awareness Month is intentionally observed during the NCAA Basketball Tournament, dubbed March Madness, when Americans are projected to wager over $3 billion. For the majority of adults, gambling is harmless entertainment, if not a bit foolish, given the tall odds in favor of casinos and sportsbooks. America has consistently failed at legislating morality and good sense, so we lean strongly toward a free market where adults make, and live with, their choices. We still believe that Virginia made the right choice in legalizing gambling and capturing important tax revenue on activity that previously was happening, just illegally.But awareness of its societal costs is important. According to the National Survey on Gambling Attitudes and Gambling Experiences 2.0, 4 out of 5 sports bettors reported often needing to gamble more and more over time to achieve the same feeling of excitement.In other words, folks don’t stop when they get ahead.“As our state’s legislature continues to make multiple new forms of gambling legal and easier than ever to access, it’s important for Virginians to be aware of the signs of problem gambling, whether it’s for themselves or someone they know,” said Dr. Carolyn Hawley, president of VCPG.She touted the Virginia Problem Gambling Helpline, a free service that refers callers to “peer recovery specialists” who are experienced in gambling and/or substance use. These specialists can answer questions, provide support and direct callers to resources in their geographic area.Problem gambling is defined as all gambling behavior patterns that compromise, disrupt or damage personal, family or vocational pursuits. About 2 million U.S. adults (1% of the population are estimated to meet the criteria for severe problem gambling. Another 4 to 6 million meet the criteria for mild or moderate problem gambling.The helpline, 1-888-532-3500, is open to text messages and voice calls 24-7 all 365 days of the year for anyone with questions about a gambling problem for themselves, a friend or a loved one. Those who prefer online chat can visit vcpg.net. All callers who allow follow-up calls receive regular contacts via phone, text and email after 48 hours, one week, one month and six months.We commend VCPG for this important public service.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

suffolknewsherald_2023_66,"Published 5:30 pm Tuesday, April 18, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardCommonwealth Attorney Narendra R. Pleas’ timing for a new program looking to address the increase in Suffolk’s violent crimes couldn’t be better.The city continues to see a rise in gun violence and criminal activity despite police adapting their methods and adding new technology to assist them.Operation Ceasefire is a welcome addition to the mix as it looks to bring prosecutors, law enforcement agencies and community organizations together in a “collaborative, focused-deterrence program.”We like Pleas’ approach that provides those who find themselves in trouble a second chance. And just that, not a third, fourth, fifth or sixth one.Suffolk’s Operation Ceasefire operates differently compared to past programs by steering a person away from criminal activity.“Ours focuses on deterring behavior before we get to the point where we have negative consequences,” Pleas said in announcing the program Thursday, April 13. “We are trying to stem individuals away from the tide of increased violence that we’re seeing by offering alternatives, or for some people not just alternatives, but perhaps a launching pad for them to be successful in other ways that they weren’t before.”The program rightly acknowledges that a lot of crime stems from lack of education, resources and treatment for some people.“If we can get in and deter those people before they get connected to the criminal activity, then that makes them a better person, that makes their families better, that makes our communities better and safer,” she said.Pleas is correct when she says prosecutors are not just there to lock up criminals. They can play a vital role in getting people back on the right path.Operations Ceasefire Prosecutor Amanda Abbey is a welcome addition to Pleas’ team with experience and knowledge she brings to the new position, funded through a two-year $326,500 state grant.Pleas and Abbey will not only be working with those in the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s office and the city’s law enforcement agencies, they have commitments from community partners in areas such as education, substance abuse treatment and mental health resources.With its intelligence-based methodology, Operation Ceasefire provides a directed “cease and desist” message to those engaged in activities known to lead them on to violent crimes. Plus it works with a zero tolerance approach.Those in the program will have support with their education issues, job skills, substance abuse issues, mental health issues, or any others the community can assist them with so they can become productive members of the community, Abbey explained. If they do not take this avenue that is presented to them and they choose to continue instigating and victimizing the community of Suffolk, she said Operation Ceasefire is going to focus on them until they stop committing crime or they have been removed from the community.To work, the program needs our support.Suffolk residents, businesses, churches and community organizations now have the opportunity to join with Pleas and Abbey in changing these first-time offenders’ lives by getting them on the right path.“We want them to be successful, productive citizens in the community and we are going to offer them this one opportunity and assist them in becoming productive citizens within our communities,” Abbey said Thursday.If given the opportunity to lend your support to Operation Ceasefire as it begins its work, lend a hand to help those find their way to become productive residents of our city with the chance to improve their lives and their neighbors.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

Glenn Youngkin for possible bans on abortion after 10 weeks or 15 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions for rape or incest victims, House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, told reporters Monday that it’s unlikely such legislation will get traction this year.Democrats, most of whom oppose abortion restrictions, still control the state Senate, and House Republicans who represent swing districts want no part of abortion changes after watching the issue cost many moderate Republicans their chances of winning in the congressional midterm elections nationwide.We understand their reluctance. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, Americans have consistently resisted state efforts to outlaw or restrict abortions, either through voter referendums or by punishing lawmakers who pass them without citizen input.That doesn’t mean that legislators can’t find some common ground on the societal problem of unwanted pregnancies.We hope they take a close look at – and pass – Del. Emily Brewer’s recently filed bill that would create a nonrefundable tax credit for individuals or couples who adopt a child.House Bill 1553 would award the tax credit for adopting children outside your own family. The issue is personal for Brewer, a Suffolk businesswoman who was herself adopted as a child.“As a child of adoption, it is important to me to ensure that we encourage adoption throughout the commonwealth,” said Brewer, R-Isle of Wight. “The cost of adoption, while worthwhile, can be expensive. This tax credit creates an opportunity to relieve some of that burden.”Regardless of how one feels about a woman’s right to abort a pregnancy, most all of us can agree that adoption of an unwanted child by a loving family is an optimal outcome.We urge Democrats and Republicans to unite in support of Brewer’s proposed tax credit.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Let’s build some casinos instead!As the late and respected Pwo navigator Kalepa Baybayan said during a 2019 hearing regarding the protests and moratorium proposal:“TMT has endured a long and tenuous legal process, and the Supreme Court ruled favorably to uphold BLNR’s right to grant a Conservation District Use Permit in an adversarial process (during which both sides (presented evidence to make the case. One side is successful in arguing the case, and one side is the loser. So now (to disagree with the verdict by … blockading TMT construction crews’ access to the mountain is the behavior of an immature adolescent and it unfairly punishes the project. Everybody, you need to learn how to share the mauna. Mahalo.”I entirely agree.Isabelle DeGrooteWaikoloaRaise minimum wage, cut taxesThe minimum wage at this time in Hawaii is $12 per hour, which seems like a good amount, right? But when compared to other places like New York or Washington, it’s several dollars less.Now, I know what you’re thinking, “a few dollars isn’t that much!” Oh, but it is. Every dollar, every penny counts when you’re living in the most expensive state in the U.S.The minimum wage to sustain a living in Hawaii is around $20 per hour, and with a family to provide for, perhaps much more. Even with two adults working full time, that amount of money still wouldn’t be enough to sustain a comfortable life for the residents of Hawaii.The citizens of Hawaii have been protesting the costs of living for over 100 years, dating all the way back to the 1860s. Everything is doubled, from the cost of housing to the groceries found in your local Foodland, and don’t forget about the unreasonably high taxes.This situation has caused Hawaii residents to fall into debt, unable to provide for themselves or their families, therefore possibly leading to homelessness. Families go from paycheck to paycheck, still not making nearly enough to pay for bills, food, etc.Action needs to be taken. Thousands of people have left their homes to go to the mainland in hopes of finding a better chance of a life. The people of Hawaii do not deserve this. The people of Hawaii shouldn’t need to leave their homes where generations before them grew up.This island is our family, and taking care of each other has never been unfamiliar. Coming together and protesting against the state to raise our income/wages and lower tax rates would be a good start. We can make a difference.Katelyn Lagaret-HollisterHonokaa"

Suffolk is by far the largest population base in a district that spans all of Western Tidewater and westward into Emporia, Greensville County and Brunswick County.Our newspaper is proud to give voters a chance to size up the two Republican candidates vying to advance to November’s general election and face state Del. Clinton Jenkins, D-Suffolk, who is unopposed for his party’s nomination in the 17th.Thursday night in Franklin, we will join The Smithfield Times, The Tidewater News and Windsor Weekly in hosting a forum with state Del. Emily Brewer, R-Isle of Wight, and Emporia businessman Hermie Sadler. It starts at 6:30 p.m. at the Camp Community College Workforce Development Center, with former News-Herald Publisher Steve Stewart as moderator.We’re eager to see Brewer and Sadler side by side on the same stage talking issues after a feisty start to their race, filled with party in-fighting and even a lawsuit that forced a Richmond judge to settle a heated debate over whether the GOP nominee should be decided in a primary or a convention.The judge ordered a primary, which will be held on June 20. Early voting begins May 5.Much is at stake in the race. Currently, Democrats hold a narrow majority in the Senate, which serves as a check on Republican control of state government. Republicans control the House of Delegates, and a Republican, Glenn Youngkin, resides in the Governor’s Mansion.A Republican victory in the 17th Senate District might just flip control of the Senate and give the party a trifecta of power that clears the way for Youngkin to fully implement his conservative agenda, reversing many of the signature initiatives of his predecessor, Democrat Ralph Northam.On the other hand, a Democratic win in the 17th this fall could secure the party’s control of that chamber for four more years and stymie Youngkin and House Republicans.Party power aside, the newly drawn 17th is a chance for Suffolk and Western Tidewater to flex some political muscle in Richmond. For a decade, the region has been sliced and diced among Senate districts whose population bases were metropolitan Hampton Roads and the Peninsula. We’ve been largely an afterthought for elected representatives who didn’t really need our votes.Whatever the outcome this November, Western Tidewater will now have a state senator focused completely on this region and its needs.

If that one’s not convenient for you, other choices are July 31 at Pearl Bailey Library in Newport News; Aug. 1 at First Baptist Church Lambert’s Point in Norfolk; and Aug. 2 at Churchland Branch Library in Portsmouth. All open houses run from 5:30–7:30 p.m.The project team has finalized its proposed recommendations for crossing the harbor, which includes Interstate 664 and the Route 164 connector into Suffolk.These are the final in-person programs on the plans, HRTPO officials said in a news release.During the open houses, area residents can talk with the study team, review proposed transportation recommendations and provide input. There will be a brief presentation at 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. with the same information presented at all four meetings.HRTPO kicked off the Regional Connectors Study in June 2018 with funding from the Hampton Roads Transportation Accountability Commission, according to its website. The study focuses on Hampton Roads connectivity through the lenses of congestion relief, economic vitality, resiliency, accessibility and quality of life.The regional connectors study builds on the work examined in the Hampton Roads Crossing Study Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, which includes: Route 164 widening, the I-564 connector, the 164 connector, the I-664 connector and I-664 widening, north of College Drive.Once complete, the regional connectors study will provide a long-term vision for connectivity improvements for the region, with recommendations for segment tiering and further evaluation.In other words, this is important work that will be strengthened by citizen involvement.For more information about the study and open house details, visit connectorstudy.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Its ingress into the mainland and foreign markets has given us welcome specialized alternatives to the conglomerate fleets of the mainland.This “merger” has been called a “match made in heaven,” and “both airlines have so much in common.” That phrase is undoubtedly coined by investors who stand to gain financially by the merger.Having flown both airlines many times, with Alaska at times not even being able to offer a pillow or blanket in premium class, the only thing I see these two have in common are planes that have wings and wheels.

A few take a more literal approach to the calendar, ascribing that honor to June 21. But for many of us here in Suffolk, summer doesn’t really start until the city kicks off its TGIF concert series each year.The first event of the 2023 season will be held on Friday at Constant’s Wharf Park behind the Hilton Garden Inn downtown. Each Friday through July 14, bands will entertain and food and beverage vendors will provide refreshments for people looking for an inexpensive, close-to-home way to kick off the weekend. Beginning July 28 and running Fridays through Aug. 18, the event will move to Bennett’s Creek Park in North Suffolk.Festivities begin at 6 p.m., and the bands will perform from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. Admission is free for all ages.TGIF is great fun for the whole family. It helps build community by bringing people together in an informal setting to forge new friendships and new ties. And it showcases two of Suffolk’s jewels, Constant’s Wharf and Bennett’s Creek parks. Without these events, many people in and around the city might not know about these wonderful civic resources.In future years, the downtown version of TGIF is expected to move to the new Festival Park at Saratoga and Washington streets, bringing big crowds to the core of the central business district.We commend the Suffolk Parks and Recreation Department for its work planning and organizing the concert series each summer. Most of us just show up for the fun, but months of hard work precede the festivities. We also give a tip of the hat to this year’s sponsor, Sentara Healthcare, whose generosity alleviates any need to charge admission.There are plenty of things to do this summer, and it can be easy to find excuses not to add to the list. But TGIF is worth an occasional change of plans from the normal Friday night dinner-and-a-movie fare.

eugeneweekly_2023_40,"We ve got issues. We are lucky to live in the Pacific Northwest — but long-term rainfall trends are down. And Eugene’s summers are hotter, drier. Ominous. We’re not alone: From 1987 to 1992 California shriveled like a raisin in the sun. And on the East Coast? In 2000 Georgia experienced its worst drought since the start of record keeping in 1895; mid-2001 to mid-2002 — Maine’s driest period ever. Despite these unmistakable warning signs, silence from Washington, D.C., continues to deafen: no national commission on water usage policy; not a peep concerning proactive national and regional watershed management; no mandates for community water conservation planning or recycling by industry. In Eugene, where do we stand? The last few weeks’ increased shower activity has helped reduce overall rainfall deficit, but the U.S. Geological Survey chart for April 11 still lists Eugene as “abnormally dry” (D0 , temporarily “coming out of drought,” even though it remains in a long-term “severe drought” (D2 . Our early spring rainfall totals remain below normal for both the calendar year and the rain year (Oct. 1, 2022 to Sept. 30, 2023 . Calendar year through Dec. 29: our total rainfall of 30.67 inches needed 33 percent more (another 10 inches to reachThe Register-Guard’s listing of a 40.5-inch “normal.” January and February of this year was the eighth driest first two-month period in the past 129 years. The overall trend shows that 15 of the past 22 years have yielded rainfall totals well below 40-inch norms. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Temperatures? 2021 came in as our second warmest year in the last 82, including a new all-time record high in June of 111°F — three degrees over 1981’s previous record of 108°F. And since 2000, Eugene’s population has increased from about 139,000 to today’s figure of more than 182,000. Per capita water usage estimates vary, but most sources would give 70 gallons daily per person as an acceptable figure. Therefore, with 43,000 more people, every day we are using almost 3 million more gallons of water than we did in 2000, an amount that will only increase as temperatures continue to rise. Now add in the “urban heat island effect.” In summer, for example, New York City is about 7°F warmer than surrounding areas. According to the EPA, “Urban heat islands occur when cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat. This effect increases energy costs (e.g., for air conditioning , air pollution levels, and heat-related illness and mortality.” Buildings block cooling breezes while the sun’s heat gets absorbed by dark asphalt and concrete during the day only to be radiated back at night, disrupting sleep. Given its recent growth, Eugene now stands as Oregon’s second largest city, just ahead of Salem. Therefore, with hotter summers caused by climate change, we also face an increasing heat island effect. What can we do to save water, keep temperatures lower, and maintain a cooler, moister, more comfortable environment? Careful urban planning will be crucial as we urge city leaders to consider the following steps: While Eugene has been blessed with recent rains, it still faces increasing challenges from hotter summers, forest fires and long term rainfall deficits. We should take further measures that will make our city shadier, cooler, moister and even more livable."
philinquirer_2023_1,"Skip gatherings with people who make you feel bad, watch for unexpected manifestations of grief, and look for ways to include the person you lost, even if it s just a photo on a mantel. The holidays are here. The lights are strung, the holiday music is on incessant repeat, and many of us are frantically finishing our shopping. For most, it’s a time of joy, holiday parties, and the occasional family drama. Yet, as a grief professional, I know that this season brings a tremendous amount of sorrow. For some, it’s the first Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa since their loved one died. For others, it’s the 10th, but the absence still feels sharp and surprising. » READ MORE:Before Father’s Day, many of us are riding waves of grief | Opinion From my years of working with grieving children and families, I have heard all sorts of reasons why this season is hard. The holiday isn’t the same without Mom. No one can hang the outdoor lights like Dad could. Death has brought about a new stepfamily that adds a whole different layer of family drama to the holidays. For me, it’s every time I hear “O Holy Night,” which my mother often sang at church with her beautiful dramatic soprano voice, effortlessly hitting the highest note at the end. So what do we do with the grief that sneaks up on us this season? Here are a few steps I recommend: 1.Make a plan.Set out a plan for how you want to engage in the holiday season. Think about the people you want to spend the season with, as well as those you might want to avoid. Examine the boundaries you need in place. Then, give yourself grace if your path diverges, your plan changes, or you fall short of the boundaries you had hoped for. 2.Grief doesn’t always look like we expect.As we continue edging through the holidays, many people don’t think they’re grieving, but they’ll cite all other sorts of issues: melancholy, irritability, fatigue, inability to focus, lethargy, overeating/drinking, and people-pleasing. What is not always understood is that these — and many other behaviors or habits — could be grief-related. Without judgment of yourself, watch for these behaviors and try to see what is causing them. It could be grief forcing its way in. Make room for it. 3.Find purpose or meaning beyond your pain.In hisrecent podcastabout grief, Anderson Cooper interviewed President Joe Biden about his experiences of the loss of his first wife and two of his children. Biden said, “You have to find purpose beyond your pain.” We grief professionals refer to this as meaning-making, a critical step grievers need to take in therapy or as a task in mourning. This step has personal meaning to me. It was critical to my journey of leaving my career as a lawyer, becoming a social worker, and dedicating my professional work to grief. Now, every day, I connect with my clients over our shared experiences of grief, reminding us that we are not alone. It makes meaning of my mom’s death when I was 15. As you move into this holiday season, if you’re struggling with grief, I encourage you to think on the meaning and your purpose despite the pain you’ve experienced. You can also consider making a small first step, like donating to a charity that researches the disease your loved one had, or just giving back to a family in need. The pain of loss can give us a window into what others are facing. You can use that perspective, in ways big and small, to help make the world better. 4.Just say no.Don’t have dinner with family members who make you miserable. Don’t have holiday cocktails with the friend who always makes you feel like less. Don’t agree to open gifts with the stepfamily who disregards your mother’s death. It is healthy to set limits that make you feel safer. 5.Find a way to include the person you lost.I’ve worked with clients who have made a purpose of placing a picture of their son who died on the mantle among the twinkly garland. That way,he’s there for the holiday and sees all the hustle, bustle, and craziness. There are so many ways to bring your loved one into the holiday, whether it’s crafting a memory candle with your kids, making your mom’s Christmas cookies, or starting a new tradition that is uniquely yours. » READ MORE:I make my mom’s recipes every Thanksgiving. They remind me of what I lost, and what I still have. | Opinion If you are experiencing big feelings this holiday season,know that what you are feeling is normal. Grief is a long arc. It travels along with us throughout our lives, and spikes in times like these. This holiday season, give yourself the gift of grace. Darcy Walker Krause is the founder of Good Grief Gal LLC.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_21,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Fiscal responsibility has never been a hallmark of the current administration — and President Joe Biden isn’t much concerned about changing course. Now the White House stands by as federal bureaucrats let billions in COVID aid go up in flames.During the pandemic, Congress approved the $500 billion Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. Its mission was to provide loans of up to $2 million through the Small Business Administration to help businesses cover non-payroll expenses incurred during shutdowns. The loans — more than 4 million — were to be repaid.Like many similar COVID initiatives, the EIDL program was infested with fraud. According to Reason magazine, an estimated $136 billion — one-third of the money distributed — was sent to scammers. The statute instructed the SBA to refer all delinquent loans to the Treasury Department, “which has the authority to take steps the SBA cannot, like garnishing wages and foreclosing on property, in order to encourage repayment,” Reason reports.Yet the SBA in April stopped efforts to collect fully 75 percent of the loans — those under $100,000 — on the basis that enforcement costs “would likely be more than the recovery amount” thanks to the extent of the fraud.Who says crime doesn’t pay?To make matters worse, the SBA’s inspector general says that ignoring delinquencies likely violates federal law. It also sets an awful precedent.“SBA’s decision not to pursue all available collection activities for these loans,” wrote Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware, “does not hold those who borrowed upon the public trust accountable and could incentivize other COVID-19 EIDL recipients to stop paying on their loans, creating a larger chain of delinquency.”Republicans in the House and Senate have demanded answers. The House Small Business Committee last month opened an investigation into the SBA’s decision, while Republicans in the upper chamber have requested records from the agency. “It’s completely unacceptable,” Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, told The Washington Post, “that SBA is leaving taxpayers on the hook for $62 billion in EIDL loans.”Unacceptable, yes. Surprising, no. This is the same administration, after all, that sought without congressional authorization to erase up to $10,000 in debt for each student loan borrower.There seems to be few limits when it comes to Mr. Biden giving away taxpayer money.“The overall losses to taxpayers threaten to reach into the billions of dollars,” the Post reported, “compounding the government’s fiscal troubles as the deficit rises and interest rates soar.”The president is clearly indifferent to any of that. Republicans should continue to demand the SBA pursue the delinquent loans. It’s past time someone showed respect for the taxpayers.— Las Vegas Review-Journal"
leoweekly_2023_46,"Wewere standing near the rail as the horses emerged for the post parade, a pair of racetrack rubes poised to gawk at greatness.It was May 19, 1973. Preakness day at Pimlico. A chestnut colt won the Kentucky Derby in record time and, having never before attended a horse race, a couple of curious college students drove to Baltimore to see what the buzz was all about.Sham, a brilliant horse born the wrong year, was first on the track for the day’s feature race. He wore the No. 1 saddle cloth indicative of his post position, and carried the young Laffit Pincay Jr. on his dark bay back. He looked sleek and powerful to the untrained eye — as he surely did to the smarter money — every bit what you would imagine a racehorse to be.Then we caught a glimpse of Secretariat. And he looked like a monster. Or, as Pimlico general manager Chick Lang put it, “like a Rolls-Royce in a field of Volkswagens.”Fifty years later, memories may be unreliable. But I distinctly remember being struck by Big Red’s shiny coat, his broad chest and his imposing muscles and thinking, as Nicely-Nicely Johnson had, “I got the horse right here.”He was running last when we lost sight of him entering the first turn that day at Pimlico, but he rocketed to the lead by the time he came into view again on the backstretch, and was still first to the finish line, 2 1/2 lengths ahead of Sham. Nearly 40 years later, correcting a clock malfunction, the Maryland Racing Commission decided Secretariat had run another record time: 1:53.“He could have won by 10 more, 15 lengths more,” jockey Ron Turcotte said in an April telephone interview. “I was satisfied that he was running good, to save for the Belmont.”A $2 win ticket, worth $2.60 that day, was priced at $4,000 recently on eBay.Silly me, I cashed my ticket.Secretariat would ultimately own the fastest times in all three Triple Crown races, and still does 50 years later. If he was not the greatest racehorse in history – and Man o’ War may be the only other thoroughbred worthy of consideration – he retains a mystique unmatched in his sport.“He’s Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods. . .” trainer Tom Amoss said. “When you watch Secretariat run, it’s the rare horse you can watch on video and see him actually visibly accelerate on the screen. The horse that accelerates so much that you can see it with the naked eye, that’s what separates Secretariat.”There have been four Triple Crown winners in the half-century since Secretariat swept the three races in 1973 – Seattle Slew, Affirmed, American Pharoah and Justify – but none of them have inspired as much idolatry as the one known as Big Red. The great golfer Jack Nicklaus confessed in an interview that he cried while watching Secretariat win the Belmont by 31 lengths, but wondered why.“All of your life, in your game, you’ve been striving for perfection,” CBS’ Heywood Hale Broun told him. “At the end of the Belmont, you saw it.”Though born in Virginia and raced only once in Kentucky, Secretariat is the subject of a new three-story mural in Paris, Kentucky; he has inspired multiple statues in the state. In a 2020 computer simulation produced for NBC, Secretariat beat Citation by a head in a race matching racing’s 13 Triple Crown winners.Dead since 1989, his legacy lives on.“I know as a boy I could remember sitting in front of the television watching him run,” Louisville-based trainer Kenny McPeek said. “I think I was 10. And I know today it’s the reason I’m in horse racing.“He was beatable, but he certainly captured the hearts and minds of racing fans and others. Putting him on the cover of Sports Illustrated was a big deal. He definitely fueled my interest in horse racing as a boy.”Amy Lawyer, chair of the University of Louisville’s equine industry program, encountered Secretariat as a young girl during his stud career at Claiborne Farm. The granddaughter of the late Kentucky basketball coach Joe B. Hall, Lawyer remembers her brush with equine greatness vividly.“He was out in his paddock and he was impressive,” she said. “He knew he was gorgeous, he knew he was special, and he knew people were there to see him. He came running at a full gallop up to the fence and just stopped. I remember reaching through the fence and petting his shoulder and how vividly bright he was, so much more than other chestnuts.”I saw him there, late in his life, on a pilgrimage from Cincinnati. Swaybacked but still majestic, he was led out of his stall to receive visitors. We gawked again at his greatness.•*** ."

eugeneweekly_2023_17,"We ve got issues. On Wednesday, August 23,PeaceHealth announced its plans to close Eugene’s only hospital and its emergency room.Lane County Commissioner Heather Buch sent this open letter to Brian Shipley, PeaceHealth system vice president for government affairs and legal services. PeaceHealth’s decision to close Eugene’s only hospital and emergency room is dangerous to our community and rural areas that rely on that site. I am hearing emergency responders were not included or consulted in this decision-making, let alone the community as a whole that will be affected. The Eugene-Springfield Fire Department was not consulted. In 2022, they transported roughly 4,400 people to the Eugene District site. This closure will create longer ambulance call, response, and transport times. It will result in longer patient offload time and lower overall ambulance reliability. This also impacts Cahoots and their drop-off needs. Currently, I’m not seeing capacity availability at RiverBend that will meet Eugene’s needs. From a regional emergency management perspective, there is an inherent increased risk to the public of not having an emergency hospital for those who live south of the river, where a majority of Eugene residents live. What happens in a disaster and the river access is cut such as a predicted catastrophic Cascadia earthquake event? This may be a fiscal decision for PeaceHealth but it is a moral and health catastrophe for our community. Stay safe, Heather Buch Lane County Commissioner – District 5"
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_99,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°October 7, 2023 is a day destined for multi-generational infamy in Israel.On this Saturday, rockets and gunfire bore down and ordinary people were either murdered or snatched from their homes in the middle of a religious holiday, when most were praying or relaxing.Aside from infiltrating scores of communities by land, sea and air in a massive operation on Israeli soil, the Palestinian Hamas militant group also uploaded hundreds of videos, now a potent weapon of war.Many of them appeared to contain shocking footage of older Israelis led away from their lives, terror on their faces, or even of the bodies of younger Israeli women, shot and then their corpses desecrated for propaganda. A music festival near the Gaza Strip became a killing field, as attackers from the Hamas militant group with automatic weapons went “tree by tree,” one young Israeli told the BBC, shooting anyone they could find. All easily watchable on your phone.As numb as so many are to violence and cruelty, a weekend with some 600 dead in Israel, according to the Israeli government, still was a terrifying reminder of how cruel and barbaric the human race can be. Americans were likely among that number, it emerged Sunday. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority said that more than 300 on the Gaza Strip had been killed by Israeli air strikes launched in retaliation for the breaching of its borders.Given Israel’s longstanding belief in the power of deterrence, and in the associated need for retribution, those numbers are sure to rise. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke immediately of war. And war is clearly what lies ahead.In Israel this past summer, we heard first-hand of disaffection with leaders from both ordinary Israelis and ordinary Palestinians. But for most Israelis, Saturday’s events will render that moot, at least in the short term. And understandably so. Their country was brutally attacked and civilians butchered.Joe Biden was right when he said “Israel has a right to defend itself and its people.” In the wake of the Hamas action this weekend, it has no other choice.Words like “normalization,” much discussed this summer in the region, suddenly seemed risible.Aside from its carriage of sorrow and despondency, this weekend was a reminder that that which simmers can rapidly return to the boil, even if the world’s media have mostly been focused elsewhere.The same could be said of Biden’s administration, of course: As with the matter of immigration, the question of Israel and Palestine (let along Saudi Arabia long has threatened to splay inter-party disagreement. Biden has preferred to project and protect Democratic unity and put primary focus elsewhere. Not so easy now.For Israel, there are many questions for the coming days. Who paid for the Hamas weaponry and this level of logistics? What other countries were involved in all this death? How must the presence of so many hostages change its actions? How did the famously skilled Israeli intelligence forces, not to mention the political class, apparently not have an inkling of the imminence of so major an operation? That appears to have been a staggering failure, but then the U.S. was taken by surprise on 9/11, too.— Chicago Tribune"
leoweekly_2023_11,"To be “woke”has three meanings. One of those is to be awake. For example, “Anna woke in the morning sun.”The other meaning is to be “aware,” and in that awareness, to be politically or socially active. An example use of this is, “It is important to be woke in the fight for justice.” Or, to rephrase it, “It’s important to be aware in the fight for justice.”The word doesn’t mean whatever Republicans think it means. In fact, I’m not sure they even know what they think it means. I’m embarrassed for them at each instance of them using “woke” as a way to say ”Black” or “Left” which is what they likely want it to mean. It’s another symbol of the social awkwardness that is pervasive throughout the Right.To say that something is “woke” as a pejorative seems doubly odd because awareness is integral in understanding the world around us, and if one is lacking in awareness of what is fair, respectful, or correct, then what are we left with? The answer here is the modern Republican. The folks who believe that Trump won an election that he numerically could not and did not win. The same folks think that Mitch McConnell is doing a great job at representing Kentucky through his long silent pauses that show his deficits due to illness or, perhaps, agedness more than his political acumen. It’s a weird, upside-down world we live in.Let’s look at a few examples and replace woke with awareness. Just try this experiment.Florida governor and “woke” speech enthusiast Ron DeSantis said, “We have made Florida the state where woke goes to die...” He continued, “The woke mind virus represents a war on merit. It represents a war on achievement.”So what he is saying is that awareness and the state of being politically active dies in Florida and that awareness is a virus. Noted.Let’s look at another example.Donald Trump said in a Fox Interview in 2021 that the Biden Administration is “destroying” the country with “woke.”Okay, so Biden’s administration is destroying this country with “awareness.”When you take out woke and replace it within the context of awareness, which is what it means, Republicans sound more and more ridiculous, but it is part and parcel of the America they envision — one that sleeps through any and all of the corruption in government and from their party which is allowing a man indicted on many felonies to raise capital from American citizens. It’s wild times.Wanna play again?On Kentucky’s Republican candidate for governor Daniel Cameron’s Priorities page, under “Combatting Woke Ideology,” it says, “??????????????????????????????????From fighting radical ESG to protecting our children from life-altering, irreversible surgeries and ensuring that men are kept out of women’s sports, Attorney General Cameron’s message is c???lear—the woke agenda is not welcome in Ke??ntucky.?”Somehow Cameron has turned awareness into transphobia because for you to be aware of transgender people and their medical needs, or for you to be aware that some children are suffering from gender dysphoria because their gender doesn’t fit with their sex, is somehow a bad thing. Whether you support transgender individuals or not, the knowledge of them is not welcome, according to Cameron. It’s a weird flex.In a nutshell, Republicans are only saying one thing and it is insidious. When a Republican uses “woke” to argue against something they have little understanding of or don’t want their voting public to understand better, they are simply saying that knowledge is dangerous.We have, as Americans, been raised with the idea that “knowledge is power,” and the fear in Republican voices is precious as they realize that more and more Americans who are not wealthy, white, or in lockstep with them have the knowledge to subvert and undermine their quest to make an ignorant people unable to understand, therefore unable to fight back against corruption and having their lives become more expensive while their wages stagnate.Even younger members of their own party are begging them to stop saying it, but they’ve dug in their silly little heels and will die on the hill of “awareness” because they refuse to get woke to the fact that the way they use the word, doesn’t mean what they think it does.See this week’s “Thorns and Roses” for what might be the nation’s first “woke” garden. It’s gotten that stupid.• ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_76,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°The Oct. 7 attack on Israelis by Hamas militants was an unspeakable act of terrorism and Israel has every right to use military force to prevent future such atrocities. But in doing so it must stay true to its values by doing everything possible to minimize the suffering of innocent Palestinian residents of Gaza.That seemed to be President Joe Biden’s message for Israelis when he spoke Wednesday in Tel Aviv, reminding his hosts that “the vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people.”Biden expressed solidarity with the Israeli people and promised that he would ask Congress for “an unprecedented support package for Israel’s defense.” He adroitly combined that statement of support with a gentle but unmistakable plea for Israel to achieve “clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you’re on will achieve those objectives.” This is the appropriate role for the U.S. to play at this stage.The president recalled that after 9/11: “We were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.”Israel should take that wise counsel to heart as it continues its campaign to destroy Hamas, which might soon involve an invasion of Gaza. Israeli air bombardment of the congested territory has killed at least 3,400 people, according to Gaza health authorities. That Israel does not target civilians is small comfort for the families of those killed or wounded.Nor can civilians be sure that relocating will spare them from harm. The New York Times reported this week that Palestinians who heeded an Israeli order to evacuate portions of the Gaza Strip and head south are enduring airstrikes even after they have moved.Biden also announced that Israel had agreed to allow humanitarian assistance to enter Gaza from Egypt. It’s appalling that trucks laden with food and supplies have been stalled in Egypt near the Gaza border. He also promised an additional $100 million in humanitarian assistance for Gaza and the West Bank.The president had hoped on this visit to the Middle East to meet in Jordan with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi. But the meeting was canceled after Abbas withdrew following an explosion at a hospital in Gaza on Tuesday. Biden said that the U.S. believes that the explosion was the result of “an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza,” as Israel has insisted.Finally, it’s important that Biden in his remarks Wednesday expressed support for the elusive two-state solution in which Israel would peacefully coexist with a Palestinian state. He indicated that his administration would continue to “keep working for Israel’s greater integration with its neighbors.”Now as so often in the past, the United States must balance its support for Israel with its mission of promoting peace and cooperation in a volatile region.

I pray, as always, “God bless America! May you continue to be the beacon of hope and symbol of freedom and democracy, independence and liberty, justice and equality for all.”The Fourth of July is more than a celebration of commercial sale events for businesses (big or small , corporations or companies in all 50 states that contribute to the U.S. economy, in general.It’s not only a day off from work or school, but a special one spent with family and/or friends, visitors, guests and even neighbors, barbecuing, cooking out, picnicking,enjoying concerts, fireworks, having fun together, sharing each other’s cheers and jubilations, dreams and even frustrations and politics.It’s a celebration of life, of unity, and thanksgiving to the founding fathers of the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, and all veterans of war and peace, alive or deceased, active or retired, or reserve.July 4 is an important historical observance, an event that made and continues to make the United States of America a great and powerful country. As a free, independent and democratic country, she has had the freedom that is so unique from the rest of the world since July 4, 1776.As the so-called leader of the free world, America obviously represents the world as evidenced in her multi-diverse population. Since she has become the melting pot of many races, her beauty and greatness can be attributed, not only from her material or natural resources but from her people who love to be free.It’s a fact that freedom is what every human being aspires, desires, dreams or wishes to have. But, even if God has given each and everyone the right and freedom to live when they were born, not everyone is living free and independent. Due to circumstances beyond their control and understanding, there are people in the world who are not free and independent. These people are under the control of their autocratic or dictatorial leader. Thus, it is this freedom that helps liberate others, and makes America unique, great, powerful, and wonderful.It’s this freedom that many Americans have fought and died for, and cherished for generations to come. It’s this freedom that leads America to help free other nations from oppression and abuse of power from their leaders who are autocrats and dictators. It is this freedom that sets others free and independent. Yes, it’s this freedom that perpetuates liberty, democracy, justice, equality, peace and order, and the rule of law for everybody.July 4 is an annual national holiday celebration of freedom and liberty, a commemoration of the United States of America’s Independence Day, from England, for all Americans both here and abroad. It’s also celebrated by non-Americans who are freedom-lovers and keepers, and taxpayers, and who have lived here and/or her territories outside of the contiguous United States for years, awaiting for their immigration paperwork or documents to be processed or approved to become naturalized U.S. citizens.There are people serving in the U.S, Armed Forces who are not yet citizens. They’re permanent residents, though. I believe they also want to be U.S. citizens someday to fully serve, defend and protect her while they continue to contribute to and help shape America’s future. That’s commendable. They do what they can to help protect and preserve the freedom they so cherish and enjoy. They’ve served and are still serving in the military. Others have died in defense of this nation.There are veterans of different wars and conflicts who have never waivered their support and conviction of protecting our country and her allies. They and other public servants have pledged their allegiance to serve America and defend her liberty and freedom without reservation.These freedom, liberty, independence, justice and equality, and the pursuit of happiness are embodiments of democratic values in the United States of America. These are what make America a beacon of hope, a paragon of all that is great, ideal, beautiful and powerful.In celebration of America’s 247th Independence Day, I recall an immortal speech from a Virginian-American lawyer, planter and politician turned famous orator Patrick Henry, who said, “Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_60,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°A few days after releasing two American hostages, Hamas freed two elderly female Israeli captives on Sunday. But 230 more innocent civilians — including 10 Americans — remain in the terrorist group’s hands.CNN also reports that the United States is “seeking to delay an Israeli ground offensive in hopes of getting more hostages out and aid into Gaza, according to two sources briefed on discussions.” Ensuring the safety of innocents in captivity and providing humanitarian aid to the suffering are worthwhile goals. But ultimately, it is up to Israeli officials to choose their preferred course of action in response to the brutal and murderous attack of Oct. 7.Israel is not dealing with a traditional modern enemy. Hamas makes it a policy to target Israeli civilians — hence the hostages — and will casually sacrifice Palestinian lives by provoking retaliation. On Monday, the Israeli Defense Forces released satellite images of Hamas rocket launch sites near schools, mosques and civilian buildings.According to the Daily Mail, two sites “were located a stone’s throw away from each other, one in the garden of a mosque, and another mere feet away from a kindergarten. A third was seen across the road from a UN building in Gaza and a fourth was located opposite the Manfaluti Secondary School for Boys.”This is a calculated effort to put children and others in harm’s way for propaganda purposes.“Geolocation of the images provided by the IDF confirmed the locations given were correct,” the Daily Mail noted, “and analysts pointed out that previous satellite images taken in September did not show any launch sites — suggesting that they would have been recently constructed.”Hamas wants to pin civilian casualties on the Israelis, yet seeks without remorse to harm noncombatants. While Israel takes pains to minimize the deaths of innocents, Hamas indiscriminately shoots rockets into Israel and reacts to deaths with glee. Let’s never forget who is responsible for the 1,400 Israelis who were savagely murdered two weeks ago.Since the Oct. 7 terrorist incursion, Hamas has fired thousands of rockets into Israel, many from these civilian locations, putting those nearby at risk. This abominable tactic of hiding behind the innocent appears to have resulted in scores of deaths when a rocket launched from Gaza exploded prematurely near a hospital last week. Hamas tried to blame Israel for the deaths.Those who engage in moral relativism when it comes to this conflict are toiling in the service of evil. Israel has the right to defend itself against those who overtly seek its destruction. The back-channel negotiations for humanitarian aid and the release of hostages should continue, but Israel’s looming ground invasion remains wholly justified.—Las Vegas Review-Journal"

On March 21, 1934, the sale of liquor became legal for the first time in 14 years. A front page story announced the occasion: “A state liquor control plan came into existence (without any legalized liquor to control this morning.”Trains have always been a large part of Suffolk commerce, and stories of accidents and derailments were fairly common. A short story on the bottom of the March 22 front page details a very amazing tale. A 7-year-old boy survived with no more than a bump on the head after being knocked down and unconscious and then run over by a railroad engine and two cars. The incident happened in the yards between Main and Saratoga streets. The boy ran from under a box car into the path of the engine. When the engine hit him and knocked him unconscious, he fell directly between the rail ties, allowing the train to pass over him without injury.Proof that daily life can be entertaining and interesting was revealed in this very short story on Nov. 16: “Bull runs amok in Main St. Rodeo.” The story read: “A slightly peeved bull ran amok in the business district this morning but did no other harm than frighten a few of the more timid minded citizens out of their wits. Breaking away from the Lee Holland stable, the bull made a ‘bee line’ up East Washington Street, veered to the right on North Main and was in front of police headquarters when an amateur cowboy, astride a quickly saddled horse, roped the animal after a few unsuccessful attempts. But Mr. Bull, not content to have his newfound freedom so rudely interrupted, squatted on his forelegs and refused to budge despite a few walloping blows on his ‘midriffs.’ In fact, he displayed a stubborn streak by laying on his side and would not respond to the violent tugging and other efforts to urge him to his feet. Finally someone suggested stepping on the animal’s tail and rubbing it firmly against the pavement and, to the surprise of the onlookers, the bull got up and slowly walked away.”Although bulls don’t roam the downtown streets any more, other stories highlighted that some things are still the same.Traffic problems were the topic of many meetings throughout the years, as they continue to be. Citizens were demanding action be taken relative to the dangerous condition on U.S. 58. The community was concerned at the “terrific loss of life and limb” as well as property damage during the two years the road had been opened.On a more positive note, Suffolk always has and continues to be a very charitable city. On Dec. 18, 1934, an editorial ran on the front page below a drawing of a child with Santa. The editorial beckoned the community to donate to give children the needed food to provide a good Christmas. It was the beginning of what would later be called the Cheer Fund. Over the next six days, the community raised $501.61. In 1935, $509.42 was raised.

eugeneweekly_2023_56,"We ve got issues. Change doesn’t come easy or fast, especially when there is big money at stake. For over 10 years, Community Rights Lane County (CRLC , an all-volunteer activist group, has been working to protect Lane County residents by putting an end to the deadly practice of aerial herbicide spraying in our forests. For decades, corporations, with the backing of the government, have been dousing people and ecosystems with toxic chemicals. And in the past decade, CRLC has been exercising our democratic right to ban the spraying through the initiative process. Well, attempting to — because at every turn, corporate interests sanctioned by the government have been creating obstacles and infringing on our rights. All three branches of government — from the county commissioners to the county clerk’s office to the Oregon judiciary — have done nothing but deny the rights and will of Lane County residents by blocking our initiatives from appearing on the ballot. In spring 2022, the Oregon Supreme Court refused to hear cases regarding our duly qualified measures that had been denied ballot access — one addressing the proposed aerial toxic spray ban and the other asserting Lane County residents’ right to local self-determination. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. The Oregon Supreme Court did not protect the political rights of the people, but instead sided with big corporate interests. They issued a one-sentence response: “The court has considered the petitions for review and orders that they be denied.” Even though all the rules were followed, a corporate lawsuit asserted that the initiatives didn’t pass an obscure administrative legal test for legislation — one that had never been applied to a local initiative before. And with that decision, the Supreme Court essentially erased six years of Lane County citizens’ efforts to utilize a right that the Oregon Constitution purports to protect — the people’s ability to write and adopt laws in their best interest. What community rights advocates and others who have worked to buck a rotten system have proven over and over is that democracy does not actually exist in the places where we live. It’s well past time to give real democracy a chance, and let the people decide."
leoweekly_2023_50,"EachApril the teal ribbons are pulled from their drawers, social media campaigns are launched, and Take Back the Night candles are lit. Established in 2001, Sexual Assault Awareness Month has raised public awareness and educated over two decades worth of college students on sexual assault prevention. While prevention trends in the month of April, a handful of local schools have added yearlong lessons on sexual misconduct to their curriculum in efforts to prepare their students for their journey in higher education. This month, we look at two more schools that have stepped to the front line.Walden SchoolFor Pam Zipper, sexual assault prevention education plays a vital role in a student’s education, especially in the post-pandemic world. “With the pandemic’s in-person learning restrictions, our students got a little behind socially,” said Zipper, the 7th – 12th grade director at the Walden School. “So now that we are back in the classroom, we need to help catch them up and close the gaps,” she continues. “What is sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, and consent? These are the conversations we need to be having.”And for Zipper, the sooner these conversations are had, the better.As The Walden School has students from K-12, Zipper is able to start teaching these lessons as early as eighth grade. In an introductory workshop, eighth and ninth grade students learn how their current actions have consequences that follow them into adulthood. Zipper said the purpose of educating students this young is to prepare them for their adult life. “By the time students reach adulthood, media has sent millions of messages, sending them in the wrong direction,” she said. “We approach students in a way where they don’t feel threatened by the information, but they are still educated and the earlier we do it, the better adults we are putting into this world.”As for her upper classmen, sophomores learn about the bystander effect and the mechanics of intervention, while juniors and seniors participate in sessions on consent. “Consent on a foundational level is easy to define,” said Zipper. “But it is important for students to take into account all of the different variables present when they find themselves in an actual situation.”With these workshops set to be a regular fixture at the school, it’s hoped that sexual misconduct prevention will be an embedded skill by graduation. “We sometimes wait too late to have these very important conversations, sometimes not having them until the students are adults, and to me, that’s way too late,” said Zipper. “We need to start having these conversations more and more so we can help our students navigate these uncharted waters.St. Xavier High SchoolAt St. Xavier High School, sexual misconduct prevention is closely aligned with the school’s principles. “Our standards as a Catholic school includes teaching students responsibility for self, ethical decision making, advocacy skills, and being able to assert one’s self when necessary,” said school counselor Amber Wissing. “It is also in our school counseling standards to cover different social and emotional pieces with our students and sexual misconduct prevention is one of them,”she said.While sexual misconduct is a topic that’s taught in the school’s theology courses, the counseling department’s recent 11th and 12th grade workshops, have added elements of college culture to the comprehensive message. “It’s important that the students hear about sexual misconduct more than once and in different ways from various people,” said Wissing. She states that by adding elements from college life to their workshops, students will be better prepared to handle the real situations that await them in their undergraduate lives. “The reality is that our students will be faced with many situations, some with alcohol involved, some where they are bystanders,” she said. “So, we need to talk about what’s happening on college campuses and what the right decisions are in the different scenarios they’ll encounter.”Wissing said the student response to these lessons has been wholly positive. “The majority of the students have said that these lessons are needed and they appreciate how down to Earth and relevant the topics of consent and bystander intervention are for them,” she states.As St. X prides itself on being an institute of college preparation, Wissing hopes that these workshops will continue that very mission. “Anytime you think a scenario through, it makes you better prepared to live that scenario. So now that they have examined these scenarios that occur on college campuses, and they’ve been given tools to navigate those situations in a healthy way, then when and if needed, they will be better equipped to pull those tools out and use them.”• ( ."

Most residents do not know that there are graves out there that need to be protected and would not damage them anyway. We are talking about the usual few people who trash our streets and do other things that cause restrictions to be put on all of us who just want to enjoy the island.As a resident of almost 20 years, and having lived in the Kapoho area for all that time, many of us would spend the day out there near the ocean taking in its beauty and peace.We would also witness families who would rough camp with their children for a weekend, and to fish, swim and cook over an open fire! (What a great experience for kids! This is one of the very few places on the island, and especially on this side, where this can happen.I urge the council not to just dump it onto the DLNR — as they will ponder it for years, and it will remain closed to those of us who respect the Cape — but to get with the groups affected and to come up with some plan to present to the DLNR.Be proactive and come up with suggestions to get it started. It should be one that the public can use the area, but the graves are protected in some way, whether it be by fencing or like on the “red road” where some are put in a concrete sarcophagus with places for flowers, or the graves are consolidated into one area and then made safe in some manner. Anything but nothing!Please do not just give to the DLNR a letter, because it is a political waste of time, and many of us want to enjoy the area again.Open the road so at least police will have access to the area to provide some effort to bring control and law back into the area, which has been missing for 5 1/2 years.We all want our Cape back.

Not surprising to most, the board voted to table the topic for its next meeting. In a 5-2 vote, the board decided they needed to have more conversation.While it is a complex and important decision, hasn’t there already been enough discussion, hate and division in the conversation?Speaker after speaker pleads their case, with each saying the things that align with whichever side of the topic they are on. But it gets repetitive. How many times must we hear the same thing to start every meeting?The discussion has ranged from hate-filled words to the opposition to calling board members and the superintendent names. We’ve heard accusations that may or may not be based in fact. All the while, nothing is getting accomplished. Outbursts from those in attendance have resulted in meetings coming to a screeching halt.What are we teaching the children we say we are trying to protect? Is it OK to say hurtful things while trying to decide whether the model policy will help or hurt the children? Sure, we are showing those children to stand up for what they believe in, but at what cost?Let’s not forget the constant bickering between board members and the chairman.Meanwhile, the division has an uphill battle in improving test scores and graduation rates post-Covid-19.Not to mention, John F Kennedy Middle School was recently accredited with conditions, again, and the Virginia Department of Education Board recommended the appeal be denied.The blatant lack of respect and professionalism must be addressed. We understand we will not all agree on things, but we can do so without spewing hate.The model policy has been on the agenda since July. It is past time to figure this out and move on to figuring out how the schools in this division can continue to thrive in the classroom. For now, it appears we must look forward to more hateful rhetoric during the holiday season.We hope that by the time the board meets in December the necessary conversations have been had and a vote for or against ordinance23/24-14 will take place.

His explanation that Republican candidates did not attend because “the forum in Suffolk was run by partisan organizations with agendas” is revealing as well as incorrect. While all of the organizations that organized, publicized, and held the forum have public policy agendas, they are nonpartisan, meaning they don’t support or oppose candidates. They do, however, take positions on political issues just as the candidates do. All of the questions asked at the forum reflected the interests and concerns of the citizenry, not the agendas of the sponsoring organizations. Candidates who don’t attend forums because they don’t like the agendas of the organizations who take the time to provide this civic service in support of our democratic process don’t display much confidence in themselves or their political positions if they can’t defend themselves in a civilized, moderated debate in front of their potential constituents.

eugeneweekly_2023_57,"We ve got issues. For decades, the fossil fuel industry has worked tirelessly to ensure that we associate gas stoves with luxury and gourmet cooking, but now, this façade is starting to crumble. For many, the blue flame is becoming a symbol of pollution, respiratory disease, climate change and even carcinogens — thanks to national discourse around the growing body of research linking “natural” methane gas to significant health impacts. As a medical student at the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU , I think it’s past time that Oregon state leaders take steps to protect communities from dangerous air pollutants from gas appliances. As a lifelong Eugene resident, I am proud that my city is leading the way by developing Oregon’s first policy to phase out gas appliances in new residential construction. The scientific literature connecting gas stoves with health harms like asthma dates back decades. Dozens of peer-reviewed scientific studies connect gas stoves with unhealthy air quality in homes, and health impacts like asthma. A new peer-reviewed study published inInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, which made headlines this year, found that 13 percent of childhood asthma cases in the U.S. can be attributed to gas stove use — that’s more than 650,000 kids with asthma caused by the continued use of gas. The research connecting gas stoves with childhood asthma is so convincing that major medical associations, including the American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association, have passed resolutions/proposed policy statements declaring gas cooking a public health concern, and advocating for programs to support an equitable transition to healthier electric alternatives. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. But it’s not just asthma that Oregonians should be concerned about with gas stoves. There is also a strong connection between gas stoves and unhealthy levels of benzene, a chemical linked to cancer. A groundbreaking study by Oakland-based PSE Healthy Energy on stoves in California found that the appliances are leaking alarming levels of benzene directly in homes — and in residences with the leakiest stoves, benzene concentrations were comparable to living with second-hand tobacco smoke. Despite this overwhelming body of research, gas utilities, trade associations and fossil fuel industry players like our local gas utility company, NW Natural, are trying to sow doubt about the established science by referencing a single study out of context. The gas industry’s misuse of this study’s findings are so egregious that one of that study’s co-authors, Dr. Bert Brunekreef, has begun publicly protesting the industry’s abuse of his work, stating that the American Gas Association’s attempts to refute the established science is “not a good use of our study.” Brunekreef’s later work found a link between gas stoves and asthma. For many low-income communities and communities of color, health risks from gas stoves in homes are compounded by high levels of fossil fuel pollution outdoors. This is true in west Eugene, where I grew up in the working-class Bethel neighborhood — a community where 66 percent of households are considered low-income, and where a higher percentage of people of color reside compared to the rest of the city. Factories and industries in west Eugene are responsible for 96 percent of all toxic emissions released in Eugene, and asthma rates in the Bethel School District are almost double those of other neighborhoods in Eugene. Living with a pollution source like stoves directly in our homes is an added risk for our already overburdened lungs. Despite a decades-long propaganda campaign waged by the gas industry to convince us to love our gas stoves, and targeted advertising to children in the form of school work books, public sentiment is turning toward electrification. I myself just moved into an apartment with an electric induction stove and absolutely love it. Oregonians won’t be fooled by the fossil fuel industry. There is no doubt that burning gas in homes is dramatically impacting our health and our safety, and our climate. It’s time to ditch this polluting fuel and transition to safe, electric alternatives that not only reduce risk for our most vulnerable community members, but will also help to ensure a livable climate and a future for younger generations. I applaud the city of Eugene for moving forward with electrification and encourage folks to write in support of the ordinance to require that new homes are all electric that is currently being considered.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_36,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°When the COVID pandemic cast its dark cloud over the United States, there was an unexpected silver lining: Child poverty was all but wiped out.Sadly, though, that great achievement didn’t last. Census Bureau figures released in September show that in 2022, the percentage of America’s children living in poverty had jumped dramatically and is now higher than before the pandemic took hold.That high level of child poverty should not be acceptable, especially not in our advanced, industrialized nation. Children in the United States should have a decent standard of living. They deserve to grow up with a reasonable chance of becoming healthy, happy and productive adults.We — representatives in Washington, voters, citizens — should act now to return to the strategies that we know lifted millions of children out of poverty, at least for a while. We need to look back only two years to see what can be done.The first full year that we struggled through the disruptions of COVID, 2021, turned out to be a great year in terms of reducing the number of children living in poverty. The year before, 9.7% of America’s children lived in poverty, according to the federal Supplemental Poverty Measure. In 2021, that percentage fell dramatically, to 5.2%. Millions were lifted out of poverty.The reason is obvious: The improvement was due to emergency measures by the federal government to ease the financial burdens caused by the pandemic. Leading the list was the enhanced version of the Child Tax Credit program, designed to help parents deal with financial problems caused by disruptions to schools, child-care programs and jobs. The new tax credit program gave parents a yearly tax credit of up to $3,600 per child, some of which could be paid upfront monthly rather than waiting for taxes to be filed the next year.Other emergency relief programs — stimulus checks, increased unemployment insurance, increased Supplemental Nutrition Insurance Program payments — also helped cut the child poverty rate to 5.2% nationally.But as the pandemic eased, Congress allowed the enhanced CTC and other emergency measures to end. At the same time, extra federal funding for child care is ending and Medicaid coverage is shrinking. It doesn’t help that inflation is driving up the costs of food and nearly everything else.Census Bureau figures for 2022 show that as those programs ended, the child poverty rate in the U.S. more than doubled, to 12.4% — representing about 9 million children. We successfully lifted millions of children out of poverty, only to plunge them back in. We saw what we needed to do, but then we stopped doing it.After one year of marked improvement, the U.S. is back to having one of the worst percentages of child poverty among all the world’s democracies with market-based economies. It doesn’t have to be this way.What are our priorities? Surely helping children to have minimally decent lives — and chances for better futures — should be high on our lists. There may be legitimate discussions about minor adjustments to the Child Tax Credit program, but there should be no question that reducing child poverty is a goal all Americans support.— The Virginian-PilotHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2023_122,"Published 5:20 pm Friday, February 17, 2023ByStaff ReportsAs a high school English teacher (of 39 years I used to draw on the chalkboard a huge heart with the inscription, in large letters, Happy VD. Obviously this had the desired effect — a discussion of love and a warning against unprotected “free love.” The word “love” has many many meanings. Let’s examine some.To modern Americans, love is an emotional state much to be desired. It conjures up visions of two thirty-somethings with two young children. Implied are: physical attraction, compatibility, family and happiness. All well and good, but let’s look at the big picture.The medieval Catholic church differentiated between two types of love, in Latin, “caritas” and “cupiditas.” The first, “caritas,” gives us the word “charity.” There abideth these three, faith, hope, and charity, and the greatest of these is love.” Christian love, love of fellow man, love of one’s neighbor as oneself. The second term, “cupiditas” has more cupid in it. It is defined as desire, for earthly things. It’s not just physical desire; it’s desire for wine, worldly possessions, earthly pleasures of all sorts.So there is the basic choice, love of others or love of self-gratification with earthly feelings.Twenty years ago we moved into our lovely Suffolk neighborhood and very soon realized what a tub of love we had fallen into. Ours is a culturally diverse neighborhood where everybody knows everybody’s names, and the names of everybody’s kids and the grandkids and even the pets. Folks stop and visit and chat in yards and on front porches. It’s truly a community of folks who love their neighbors as themselves. We share gardens, great food, joys, and sorrows. We help each other with just about everything. It’s old school.These 20 years later, it really is old school. Most of us are retired now, some of us are aging out of doing things we were once able to do — all the more reason to pull together. Recently and more frequently, a number of neighbors are putting on their wings and flying off to heaven. So those of us still here check more frequently on those who are ailing and unfortunately we’re meeting more often at funeral homes. These are all milestones of living and loving and being part of a loving community.The bright side of all this is that life and love go on. Young families are moving in and bringing new life to our street. They are having babies and they’re refurbishing houses; a new vitality is here. They have been welcomed with open arms, house warmings, baby showers and all the love and care this neighborhood has to offer. We’re glad they are here to share the love and keep it going long after the rest of us are gone and they’re the old folks of the neighborhood.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_61,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°Roy Cohn, the evil, crooked, disbarred New York lawyer, who mentored a young Donald Trump and taught him many of the nasty ways to bully, cheat and lie, was loyal to his client, but he still would absolutely sell out Trump to save himself from prison.The moral, for an immoral man, is that a lawyer who engages in a crime with a client has no protection from prosecution.And so many of Trump’s other attorneys have been lining up to rat out the rat in chief, as we saw vividly Tuesday, first with a morning guilty plea by lawyer Jenna Ellis before an Atlanta judge in the Georgia election interference criminal case. The afternoon saw disbarred New York lawyer Michael Cohen, Trump’s one-time fixer, spilling the beans before a Manhattan judge in state Attorney General Tish James’ civil case over Trump’s fake valuation of his holdings.Ellis’ plea, in the wide-ranging conspiracy indictment against Trump et al brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, was the third by a Trump lawyer in that case. Last week, Sidney Powell switched sides and then so did Ken Chesebro.Powell and Chesebro are also two of the six unnamed co-conspirators in Special Counsel Jack Smith’s federal indictment of Trump brought in Washington. Ellis was evidently too small a fish for Smith.A very big fish is Mark Meadows. He is no lawyer, but as Trump’s White House chief of staff was the top of the food chain during those nightmare years. Meadows has cut his own deal with Smith to testify, ABC News reported Tuesday. Tellingly, Meadows is not one of the half dozen co-conspirators and can provide a road map to Smith.Trump trusted his lawyers, going back 50 years when Cohn was first retained after the Nixon Department of Justice accused the Trump family real estate business of illegally discriminating against minority renters of their apartments. The charges were true, but Cohn concocted a phony suit against DOJ. Misusing the legal system was Cohn’s specialty and Trump learned well.Trump trusted Cohen to do his dirty work, like arranging the $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, which landed Cohen in trouble. After he was convicted of federal felonies and disbarred in 2019 — by the same Manhattan appellate court that disbarred Cohn two months before he died in 1986 — Cohen told Congress about Trump’s false bookkeeping before Cohen reported to prison.Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance was listening to Cohen’s testimony and started a criminal probe. In 2022, new DA Alvin Bragg wrongly dropped the prosecution, but Tish James picked it up on the civil side.Trump has already been found guilty. The ongoing trial downtown will establish the size of his financial penalty.

suffolknewsherald_2023_134,"Published 6:26 pm Friday, February 3, 2023ByLetters to the EditorDear Editor,I read with appreciation your editorial, “Be heard on Suffolk 2045” this week. I wish that these opportunities to be heard could have the effect that you, and I, desire, in potentially speaking out on the issue of warehouses in Suffolk.Unfortunately, the public hearings on the Port 460 project — a large warehouse project, approved by our City Council in recent months — shows that, at least at the present time, the Comprehensive Plans of our city are largely meaningless, and the voices of the public are, for the most part, ignored.We are two years away from the fulfillment date of the 2025 Comprehensive Plan, and 12 years away from the 2035 Comprehensive Plan. Those plans called for the agricultural area contemplated for use by the Port 460 project to be changed, at most, to residential.When residents raised concerns about the Comprehensive Plan as objections to the proposed change to heavy industrial zoning, the mayor dismissed the objections, saying that was “just a plan” and “we can change it.”In addition, at the first of these meetings, concerns about traffic safety were shut down as “not our concern.”If the Comprehensive Plan has no impact on the planning and zoning decisions of our community, the rather obvious question becomes, “why do we have them?”I would like to think that the input of the community on this process would have an impact on the direction of the city. However, the attitude of the present council certainly makes one question if there is any purpose to these meetings, other than to give the appearance of community input.Scott ThomasSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_6,"Published 7:10 pm Friday, June 30, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldWe don’t know about you, but we’re looking forward to the fireworks over Constant’s Wharf on Tuesday as a replacement for the political fireworks that lit up Western Tidewater in recent months.Burgers, hotdogs, fresh watermelon and, hopefully, some reflection on the history of this great nation sound like a delightful way for the civic-minded among us to unwind from the recent General Assembly party primaries, and associated mud-slinging as candidates duked it out for the right to advance to the November general election.That Emily Brewer-Hermie Sadler race for the Senate District 17 Republican nomination was a doozie, the lowlights including a lawsuit over method of nomination, criminal charges from an alleged physical altercation between party loyalists and some of the fiercest attack ads we’ve seen since the last presidential election.Thank goodness it’s over, with Brewer, a Suffolk retail merchant and current state delegate, the clear choice of Western Tidewater Republicans to take on state Del. Clinton Jenkins, D-Suffolk, in November. Brewer and Sadler spent a mind-boggling $800,000-plus between them in the battle for a legislative seat. That’s an astounding $52 per vote in a low-turnout election.Throw in another $200,000 from interest groups that bought pro-Brewer ads, and the price of the Republican nomination topped $1 million.Expect much more than that to be spent on the general election, given that Suffolk and Western Tidewater just might determine which party controls the state Senate for the final two years of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s term. As few as three Senate districts statewide are considered “in play,” meaning that election results in recent years show that both parties have a legitimate shot at victory. The 17th is one.Youngkin himself narrowly carried it in 2021, but Democrats have otherwise held a small advantage, including in the 2016 and 2020 presidential races. We wouldn’t place a wager on either party for this November. It’s that close.Sadler, the political newcomer best known for his time on the NASCAR circuit as a driver and commentator, at least put a conciliatory bow on the Republican brawl, issuing a statement on election night that urged his supporters to unite behind Brewer.If we’re lucky, we voters, regardless of party allegiance, will get a few weeks of downtime, including TV watching and internet browsing free of political ads, before campaigning resumes in earnest. Independence Day will be more fun because of it.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

eugeneweekly_2023_16,"We ve got issues. Oregon is in the midst of a hot, smoky summer. I watch the temperature and air quality index (AQI every day. I organize my life around what to expect outside, especially given smoky air that will require a mask to keep 2.5 sized particulates out of my lungs as I breathe hard while exercising. I do dance three days per week. This class asks me to know and do spiritual, yoga, modern, ballet and Middle Eastern dance. I also power walk for the other three days outside. I do have to be careful of heat and the amount of particulates in the air. Full disclosure: I am an older diabetic and I want to optimize my system! I work hard at this objective and I am succeeding. But climate is important to those of us who are not fully healthy, especially due to a chronic disease like diabetes. Our climate is noticeably hotter and more smokey to me now than it was in 2005. This may just be a blip over climate time. However, a review of climate science suggests we have caused this acceleration as well as what follows, and we can take steps to fix this issue over time. After all, the climate has responded dynamically to our actions for generations now, and this build-up of heat, smoke, and storm has been coming at us for a long time, too. The Oregon Legislature has been called on to find long-term solutions. To that end, they have voted to pass a comprehensive climate change package that includes initiatives to reduce carbon emissions from building construction, land use, and natural resource management. It is important for Oregon to understand that while climate change has affected me and the rest of us as individuals, this change also affects individuals such as workers, industry owners, and managers. Climate change affects both workers and industry? Yes. And, the safety of workers and prosperity of our state do not have to be at odds. Together we can work to address climate change. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. When it comes to the effects of climate over time, we must track selected numbers at selected locations and times. (e.g., ambient temperatures and air quality index as we work and manage work over time by task. Even now we have heat index measures that are distributed throughout the school system by the state Oregon. This helps keep students, teachers, and administrators healthy and functional regardless of ambient conditions. The climate package just passed by our Legislature, which was supported by both Democrats and Republicans, acts to ensure the importance of worker health, the importance of industry economic prosperity, and balance these two numbers over time in terms of salary over cost of living and profit margin by year, month, and current events. This is a pragmatic approach to a difficult set of problems, which climate change presents to the Oregonian voter. Finally, it is key to remember that greater heat and air quality affect not only workers, but the machines used by industry to help effect resource acquisition and use in Oregon and beyond our borders as we conduct business with our country and the world. Here are some of the climate conditions that can degrade machine as well as human performance by amount by event (yes, this includes computers and all their parts : 1 noise level, 2 heat level, 3 humidity level, 4 air flow efficacy, 5 dust concentration, 6 chemical concentrations, and 7 danger level. Climate change affects everyone, workers and industry alike. This change hurts our performance and we can do something about this now and in the future. The Oregon Legislature is to be commended for its current actions, and must continue to work towards ensuring our healthy future as Oregonians. This is a reassuring outcome as we continue to address climate change."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_98,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°The horror and outrage of the surprise attacks on Israel by Palestinian militants in Gaza are being compared with the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, in America and the bombing of Pearl Harbor.While the despicable attacks are hard to comprehend and must be condemned, the fallout could be even more chaotic as Israel prepares for a long and bloody war that could roil the Middle East and upend politics in the United States and around the globe.Less than two weeks ago, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said, “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.” That came to a sudden end when Hamas militants launched the worst attack in Israel since the Yom Kippur War in 1973.Hundreds were killed and several thousand were injured. The scenes captured on video were heartbreaking and hideous: An Israeli child was executed in front of her siblings and parents. Hamas fighters paraded the semi-naked body of a woman through the streets on the back of a pickup truck.Iran reportedly helped to plan the attack, just as President Joe Biden, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman were negotiating a landmark deal to forge diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.Over the weekend, rather than uniting around a plan for peace, Republican leaders, including Trump, tried to sow division by blaming Biden for releasing $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets in August as part of a prisoner swap. Never mind that Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the money was earmarked for humanitarian support and had not been spent yet. Or that Trump may share some blame in provoking the Palestinians when he moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The tinderbox in Israel comes at a precarious time in the U.S. and abroad.Republican support for the war in Ukraine is waning and could have huge repercussions for Europe. Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted that if Western support ended, Ukraine wouldn’t last a week. Without a speaker, the U.S. House of Representatives can’t conduct any business, let alone pass needed funding for Ukraine.More unsettling, the two leading contenders to be the next speaker are even more extreme than ousted leader Kevin McCarthy. Heaven help us if Rep. Jim Jordan, one of Trump’s election-denying sycophants, becomes second in line to the Oval Office.Meanwhile, Netanyahu is promising a merciless war that will no doubt also end up distracting attention from his corruption charges and efforts to upend democracy in Israel. Indeed, Haaretz, a leading Israeli newspaper, said in an editorial that Netanyahu’s actions contributed to the increased tensions between Israel and Palestinian groups like Hamas.In earlier times, the world would look to the United States to lead and help keep the peace. But the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with Trump’s “America First” agenda and the rise of MAGA Republicans, have seemed to embolden extremist groups and authoritarians to act with impunity. A new world order is needed to confront terrorist organizations and dictators, as well as existential threats like climate change, pandemics, and global inequality. Until then, the divisions here and abroad will result in turbulent times.— The Philadelphia InquirerHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_77,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°If you compare the massacres carried out by Hamas in Israel with the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as many observers have in recent days, you are offering Israel a tacit warning: Don’t repeat the kind of blunders that pervaded U.S. policymaking after the trauma of Sept. 11.That kind of admonition is easy to offer as a generalization, in the way I’ve recently offered it myself. Who, after all, is in favor of repeating blunders? But it’s harder to get specific about the lessons from the American experience that Israel should take to heart.The United States arguably fought four wars after Sept. 11: A regime change operation in Afghanistan aimed at both Osama bin Laden and his Taliban enablers, a global campaign to disrupt and destroy al-Qaida, a war in Iraq aimed at toppling Saddam Hussein and (in its more expansive moments planting a democracy in the heart of the Middle East and, finally, a war against the Islamic State group that emerged out of the wreckage of our Iraq policies.None of these experiences exactly resemble the challenge Israel faces with Hamas and Gaza; each of them yielded different outcomes, different problems, lessons that vary with the circumstances.Some lessons probably don’t apply to the current moment at all — particularly the elements of American folly that reflected our universalist overconfidence hyped up by our unique post-Cold War position as a globe-bestriding superpower. In 2003 we imagined ourselves capable of remaking the Middle East and, indeed, the world, on a scale that today’s Israel, a small country set about with enemies, is extremely unlikely to envision.Other lessons do apply, but not in any simple way. For instance, one basic lesson you could take from America’s post-9/11 disasters is the importance of restraint in moments of maximal emotional trauma, of thinking it through and counting the cost rather than just obeying a do-something imperative.Among all the various factors that led us into Iraq, one shouldn’t underestimate the impulse that we just hadn’t done somethingbigenough in response to the terror attacks, that the Afghanistan intervention alone wasn’t enough to satisfy our righteous rage or prove our dominance. And you can see this as a temptation for the Israelis now, with the horror so fresh — an impulse to reject anything that smacks of half-measures or limitations, to wave away the risks of civilian casualties or regional chaos, to treat any hesitation as a form of cowardice.But not every aggressive path America took after 9/11 looks mistaken in hindsight. The long-term debacle of our Afghanistan occupation doesn’t make our initial decision to topple the Taliban unwise. The moral failures of our interrogation program don’t mean that we were wrong to take a generally aggressive posture toward al-Qaida and its satellites. Setting out to destroy the Islamic State’s caliphate rather than seeking stable coexistence was a correct and successful call.In each of these cases, the achievement of something relatively basic — preventing terrorist groups from existing in the kind of comfort required to pull off another Sept. 11 — required much more maximalist strategies than, say, the Clinton administration undertook in the 1990s. Reportedly that kind of cruise-missile minimalism is what bin Laden expected from the United States after Sept. 11 as well. And not only was it a good thing we didn’t give to him; we couldn’t really have avoided escalation. A restraint that allowed for frequent repetitions of al-Qaida’s 2001 triumph — for mass-casualty terrorism as a consistent fact of American life — would have been politically untenable and would have eventually yielded an even more disproportionate response.A similar logic applies to Israel’s response today. You can’t have a strategy that seems to privilege caution over the goal of making it functionally impossible for Hamas to conduct operations on this scale again, because to ask a democratic electorate to accept repetitions of these massacres — which by themselves may be enough to end Benjamin Netanyahu’s many years of power — is to potentially sign your political death warrant while guarantee escalations down the road.That doesn’t mean you need to send 300,000 soldiers into the Gaza Strip tomorrow. But as we’ve seen in just the past few days, it’s not as if a strategy of airstrikes didn’t carry sustained moral and strategic risks and offer Hamas ample propaganda opportunities, regardless of whether any given horror is actually Israel’s fault. And if there is a longer-term option other than invasion, it has to account for these risks while promising success comparable to what the Bush administration did achieve — again, amid all its failures — after Sept. 11, in terms of dismantling al-Qaida and forestalling organized mass-casualty attacks and what the Obama and Trump administrations achieved in their destruction of the Islamic State group.Then if invasion is your only option, America’s post-9/11 experience also counsels for a certain degree of maximalism in the numbers committed and the plans for occupation. We were wrong to invade Iraq, but once the die was cast, we would have been better off invading with a larger army than the lighter footprint that we initially chose, and we were able to salvage a modicum of stability from the disaster only because Bush added troops when most of his wartime critics were against it. The supposed Napoleonic admonition “If you start to take Vienna, take Vienna” applies to Gaza as much as it did to post-Saddam Iraq; if you must invade and occupy, make sure you’re prepared for a true occupation, as Donald Rumsfeld’s Pentagon conspicuously was not.Of course, the core reason Rumsfeld preferred a light-footprint strategy is that he didn’t want responsibility for actually governing Iraq. And that points to the inescapable challenge for the Israelis now: Demolishing Hamas’ terrorist capacities, with or without a full invasion, requires demolishing its capacity to rule in Gaza, andsomeone has to rule in Gaza.We struggled in Iraq and failed in Afghanistan because we couldn’t easily stand up a legitimate successor regime. Conversely, we were able to demolish the Islamic State because at that point we had regional allies willing and able to govern Mosul and Raqqa.Someone has to rule, period: We’ll let that stand as a final post-9/11 lesson and the dilemma for which Israel’s Gaza policy has no clear answer yet.© 2023 The New York Times Company"

eugeneweekly_2023_41,"We ve got issues. The impacts of the climate emergency are accelerating across Oregon. No plans have been made, however, to prepare residents for the pervasive psychological and emotional stresses and traumas speeding our way. This is a monumental mistake. The Legislature and state agencies must swiftly get out in front of these issues by proactively building population-level mental wellness and resilience. Global temperatures will continue to rise, and every tenth of a degree increase will cause more severe impacts. In Oregon we can expect more frequent and extreme storms, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts and other disasters that psychologically and emotionally traumatize 20 to 40 percent of those directly impacted, as well as 10 to 20 percent of those who view the events from afar. Coupled with the disasters will be cascading disruptions to the ecological, social and economic systems residents rely on for food, water, jobs, incomes, health and other basic needs that significantly stress everyone. Left unaddressed, these stresses and traumas will have poisonous consequences. Research shows climate impacts can increase suicides, lead to more drug and alcohol abuse and cause more interpersonal aggression and violence. These troubles will add to the state’s already considerable mental health problems. National studies found that Oregon has more mental health difficulties than most other states. Gov. Tina Kotek recently asked the Legislature for $80 million to expand Oregon’s behavioral health system. Although helpful, even with more funds there will never be enough mental health providers to assist all the people with mental health conditions. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Fears of stigmatization and other factors also lead almost half of those needing help to shun professional services. In addition, mental health services are reactive: they assist people only after they have experienced symptoms of pathology and do not prevent them. The state must realize the limitations of its current approach and make concerted efforts to prepare all residents for all types of shocks and strains by using a public health approach to build universal mental wellness and resilience for all types of adversities. A public health approach focuses on the entire population, with different but connected interventions for people deemed at greater risk and those already experiencing symptoms of pathology. The top priority is to prevent mental health problems before they emerge, with group and community-minded healing methods integrated into the prevention strategies. This is achieved by strengthening protective factors that enhance everyone’s capacity to buffer themselves from, and push back against, traumatic stressors and remain psychologically and emotionally healthy and resilient during hardships. Many communities nationwide are using a public health approach, though only a few do so in Oregon. They establish the social infrastructure, often called a Resilience Coordinating Network, that continually engages a diverse network of individuals, groups and organizations in implementing strategies that help everyone strengthen their capacity to prevent and heal suffering. As Robin Saenger, director of Peace4Tarpon in Florida told me, “Community is the big deal. The human infrastructure is where the action is at.” Building social connections throughout the community is one foundational goal of these initiatives. Another is helping all residents become “trauma and resilience-informed.” Still another is helping residents find new meaning, purpose and hope in their lives. This involves actively engaging them in establishing healthy, safe and just climate-resilient local infrastructure, economies and ecological systems. Resilience hubs, which have been proposed in Oregon, are just one small element of the much more comprehensive approach that is used. The climate crisis threatens us all, and for many the situation seems hopeless. It is not. The Legislature and state agencies can help Oregonians take control of their future by prioritizing the use of a public health approach in communities to build universal mental wellness and resilience."
philinquirer_2023_0,"For change in Kensington, the scale of the solutions must be commensurate to the scale of the problem, and we must supplant ineffective approaches with a willingness to try new things. Kensington is one of the city s most intractable and complex problems, where addiction, homelessness, crime, and gun violence dominate daily life. Many fixes have been proposed, yet little changes. Often missing from any plan is community input. Along withan editorial on the topic, we are publishing opinions from some of the people devoted to Kensington who are on the front lines, keeping the neighborhood afloat. Have stories or suggestions about Kensington? Email us at opinion@inquirer.com. A century ago,Kensingtonand Allegheny Avenues were the crossroads of the quintessential urban village, where workers walked from their rowhouses to the factories that drove Philadelphia’s industry, and the El train roared above a buzzing commercial corridor. In contrast, opioids now shape the area’s economy, geography, and image. Gaunt figures use drugs, pitch tents, and do sex work along Kensington Avenue, and side streets are a mix of drug markets and besieged residents. Taken together, this section of Kensington has become a Gordian knot of urban ills. Over the course ofour research on homelessnessin Kensington, we have spoken with residents who, understandably, ask why people breaking laws cannot simply be arrested and cleared out, and why residents cannot have a quality of life comparable with other city neighborhoods. Council members and other elected officials reinforce these sentiments. Mayor-elect Cherelle Parker has pledged to crack down on the drug markets and the homeless encampments and to enforce existing laws, possibly with aNational Guard deployment. However, we also spoke with police officials who were unanimous in their assessment that this is not a problem we can “arrest our way out of.” This is backed up by a litany oflarge-scale policing operations, with names such asOperation SunriseandOperation Safe Streets, that have failed to leave any lasting benefit. While policing may be part of a solution, simply cracking down will not suffice. And we have seen that alternatives to cracking down can work. In 2018, we observed and documented city initiatives that facilitated housing and treatment for people who were displaced from encampments, expedited the paperwork that allows people to enter detox programs, and enabled police to offer services as alternatives to arrest. Nonprofits have also responded, providing“low barrier”shelters that get people off the streets, mobile medical and substance use services, and outreach services considered among the best in the country. We have seen such initiatives repeatedly help people make lasting exits from addiction and homelessness. However, the limited scope of these services means that, from a resident’s point of view, the drugs, homelessness, violence, and disorder seem as bad as ever. Two factors explain much of this. The first one is scale. While attorney general, Gov. Josh Shapiro described the area’s opioid economy as “approaching a billion-dollar enterprise.” In contrast, other than periodic large-scale law enforcement initiatives, the response to the area’s drug economy has been minuscule. Scale is essential to make a dent in the problem, meaning the presence of ample resources for treatment, housing, jobs, and community revitalization. More resources would allow the implementation of approaches such as “housing first” andmedication-assisted treatmenton demand, which we have seen work effectively in Philadelphia and in many other cities, to where they can make neighborhood-level differences. Second, instead of having politicians call for yet another police sweep, we need to try new ideas that have shown promise. One example is supporting theshadow network of recovery housingthat has quietly provided shared living accommodations and rehabilitation services for many who would otherwise be homeless. Many of these providers are unlicensed. Incentives are needed to expand these programs and to enable providers to meet some basic standards that would allow them to operate effectively and weed out unscrupulous providers. Some coordination and funding through an intermediate nonprofit provider could help to bring standards and more units online. Other approaches that have seen success are also worth exploring. Examples include expanding access to combined drug treatment and housing supports through Medicaid-funded programming, short-term or “shallow” rental assistance programs that can assist those with less intense treatment needs to regain stable housing, and support for people who might be able to obtain stabilized living arrangements with family. For change in Kensington, the scale of the solutions must be commensurate to the scale of the problem, and we must supplant ineffective approaches with a willingness to try new things. These are tall orders, and there has been little indication of popular or political willingness to do either. Unless this changes, resolution will come from real estate, the only sector that has invested in the area on a scale anywhere approaching that of the drug trade. As the drugs, homelessness, and violence have worsened, investors havequietly bought up propertiesand havestarted buildingin areas that are on the edges of erstwhile drug corners and homeless encampments.

Neighborhood residents we spoke with six years ago were already aware of this trend and expressed ambivalence at how this process at once stood to save them and to exclude them. Gentrification could well transform Kensington, but it will not solve the homeless and opioid crises as much as move them along to other hapless neighborhoods.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_20,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Automakers are now learning an important lesson: Not all car buyers are wealthy environmentalists.This should be obvious but apparently isn’t, which is why the auto industry is now wringing its hands over electric vehicle sales problems. General Motors, Ford, Mercedes, Nissan, Toyota and even Tesla have raised red flags about slowing demand. GM scaled back plans for 2024 and said it would delay the opening of a new electric truck factory. Ford is considering cutting shifts at its F-150 Lightning plant. Nissan is transferring more resources to hybrids rather than EVs. Mercedes has described the EV market as “ brutal.” And Toyota’s chairman, Akio Toyoda, said last week that “ people are finally seeing the reality” of EVs.The problem, it seems, is that the so-called next wave of EV buyers isn’t cooperating. The EV is not trickling down. At least not for those prospective buyers.But this should have been obvious. It certainly was for Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, founders of Tesla Motors. In a now well-known tale, Eberhard and Tarpenning in 2003 gathered consumer data for their nascent company by driving up and down the streets of the wealthy suburb of Palo Alto, California, and peering into driveways to see what kinds of cars the suburbanites owned. What they found tucked between the $2 million homes was Priuses. Many of the driveways contained one luxury car and one Prius, which was the environmental darling of the day. So they’d see a Porsche and a Prius. Or a BMW and a Prius. Or a Lexus and a Prius.Economists have since identified this phenomenon. They call it “conspicuous conservation,” a wrinkle on Thorstein Veblen’s century-old theory of conspicuous consumption. The idea is that some modern consumers purchase products as a way of displaying their green virtue.In 2003, Eberhard and Tarpenning couldn’t have known the term “conspicuous conservation,” but they had the wisdom to understand what they were seeing: Environmentalism had come to the doorstep of the wealthy. Thus, they concluded, they could sell electric cars to the affluent. And they believed the EV would eventually trickle down to the middle class.In its early years, this was the real genius of Tesla. Selling to wealthy environmentalists and enthusiasts became a goal. And it kept the company afloat until its bizarre stock market performance later enriched it.Eberhard and Tarpenning, however, seldom got due credit for their flash of genius. Up to that point, Detroit’s marketers had believed that electric cars should start at the bottom of the market and rise up. No sane consumer, they thought, would pay more for a vehicle that offered less. Therefore, a top-down economic model wouldn’t work.Clearly, Detroit was wrong. Wealthy enthusiasts bought Teslas.And here we are now, and the time has come for the EV to trickle down — and it’s not happening. Working-class consumers just aren’t cooperating. It seems that they have their own ideas about what to do with their disposable income.None of this is new, of course. Middle-class consumers have always had many reasons for buying cars. They need their vehicles to go to work, to Grandma’s, to college and to go on vacation. They need them for all these things, and yet they need them to be inexpensive.What they don’t need is a costly second car. And, too often, EVs have become just that. An EV’s initial cost is still too high and its practicality too low, especially for the less affluent.The auto industry is now running head-on into these realities.That’s not to say that it can’t overcome them. But middle-class adoption clearly isn’t happening at the pace automakers foresaw.Tesla knew from the beginning that trickle-down would be necessary and would be a challenge. And now that promise is coming due.Buyers of the next wave won’t purchase an EV so they can park it next to their Porsche."
leoweekly_2023_47,"It’shard to bloom in the shadows with little nurturance and parents who struggle just to survive. My maternal grandparents barely obtained sixth-grade educations and lived with cousins, uncles, and aunties on the same street and often in the same houses, not much different from my father’s childhood story.They found one another amidst this poverty and ignorance, and I find these same themes haunting my family story for generations to this day.Grandmother Mary and her entire family came up from Tennessee and left the sawmills for the coal mines. Grandpa Rubin was born in St. Charles, KY, was without a mother by the age of 9, and an orphan by the age of 16. Census reports have him living in Hopkinsville, KY with his father in boarding houses or with his paternal grandmother, Francis. Francis was widowed twice and left with five children to raise, so the marriages came and went until her final husband, T. Matheny, welcomed her, her sons and grandkids into his home.I have stories of Francis that float through my head from time to time as I can only imagine the stiff chin and resolve it took to deal with a world without women’s rights and men who were either from money or doomed to work the fields, sawmills and coal mines instead of seeking an education or having any other way to move up in the world. Francis came from money and landowners, but her name and the finances were lost by her grandfather who was hanged for his love of drinking, greed, and finally, murder. On May 1, 1846, at the age of 14, Francis’ mother Mary, witnessed her father’s public hanging.It was the first public hanging of a a white man in KY, and brought crowds from all over Muhlenberg. Mary stood by her belief that he was an upstanding man. Following this, for Mary and Francis, I imagine life to be hard for them with the disgrace of this event.They both found marriages quickly in order to survive. These were women who existed in a world that limited them to marrying well, having babies and daily housekeeping.Their lives were ingrained in fundamentalist religion, and the rights of men alone.Francis married twice. She named her first son, Eugene Alonzo Stewart, after the grandfather she never knew, who was hanged. Being the namesake of the disgraced Edward Alonzo Pennington was likely more of a curse for her son because he ended up alone with a daughter, and my grandfather Rubin.Census shows Stewart living as a boarder with his two children alone not long after his only marriage and finally back with his mother, Francis. He died of tuberculosis at the age of 43, and his mother, Francis raised Rubin to his adulthood.This was a time when communities mainly met through churches, and the Stewarts found themselves immersed in fundamental religious rhetoric. Whatever old money that brought my Stewart family to Kentucky was soon absorbed by the effects of greed, harsh living environments and religious hell-fire rage.Rubin, now an adult who grew with little guidance and a lot of fight, raised his family with no concern for education or personal growth, ruling over them by the gun and the Bible. This led to mental illness, physical sickness, supported abuse, incest, continued poverty and no accountability for the hands that molded the family at the time. These events sparked the beginning of family secrets that have passed through generations in my family — and continue to this day.The shame of how America came into being — how my family came to being — continues to haunt us all and many do not want their children to be educated about these shameful histories.The curses of our pasts continue to recur, not just in my family but in most of the families I met in my over thirty years of social work.We must acknowledge the stories of the past or we will relive them over and over again. The deterioration of families has broken my heart on both personal and professional levels in my fifty-three years of life.I accept my role as an agent of change early on. I simply could not stop myself from speaking and questioning what I saw and I could not look away.If we hide the shame, these stories disappear and the abuse the people struggled with to survive will continue in later generations. The elders must learn from and continue to share their experiences.If not, the oppressed often becomes the oppressor. By never letting go of the shame, we risk raising future generations of oppressors and continuing the cycles of poverty, hatred and stunted personal growth. I have witnessed this time and again in my own family history. It must end.•*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_1,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The New York Times is not content to let OpenAI and Microsoft get rich using the newspaper’s web content for artificial intelligence like ChatGPT without paying and sued this week in Manhattan federal court.We don’t know if the pun on the word “content” is particularly funny or if an AI robot would be inclined to such wordplay, but we do know it was written by humans, us, the people behind the words and pictures of the Daily News.And having people, not machines, tell the human stories of the city and the world for other humans to read should stay that way.We could have asked ChatGPT to write an editorial about how it is bad that ChatGPT lifted wholesale without paying from a newspaper to teach itself how to replace newspapers. However, while AI doesn’t get tired of gimmicks, real people do.The Times alleges in its lawsuit that ChatGPT was fed huge numbers of articles produced by the paper’s website to allow the program to learn using the “large language model.” As the complaint states, “an LLM works by predicting words that are likely to follow a given string of text based on the potentially billions of examples used to train it.”For teaching material, “the training set was comprised of 45 terabytes of data — the equivalent of a Microsoft Word document that is over 3.7 billion pages long.” Not all of that was from the Times, but the work of that newspaper and website, like the works of this newspaper and website, are copyrighted and can’t just be lifted.When OpenAI began it was a nonprofit, sharing with all its creations for the betterment of humankind. But the humans in charge didn’t need AI to learn about the profit motive and they changed to a proprietary system to sell. No more sharing from them and customers have to pay. But they get to borrow and not pay?They could have used non-copyrighted works for their classroom, like the collected plays, poems and sonnets of Shakespeare. That would be perfectly legal, but ChatGPT would then write and speak like an Englishman of 400 years ago. Such sterner stuff is Greek to me in this brave new world and not a wild-goose chase melted into thin air. Would star-crossed lovers be a tower of strength or get short shrift?Or they could have borrowed without any limits from Mark Twain, who during his lifetime fought furiously for laws for copyright protections. But Twain died in 1910 and all his creations are now free to use for everyone. Under U.S. law, current copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 more years.Other works have a 95-year shield, like Walt Disney’s 1928 “Steamboat Willie,” the first appearance of Mickey Mouse, which will enter the public domain on Monday, Jan. 1. Sound recordings are protected for 100 years.Craigslist, Google and Facebook vacuumed up revenue from the press, devouring classifieds, display ads and circulation. Now another internet invention, AI, is threatening the press itself. As the lawsuit says, “if the Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their independent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill.” And yes, we meant to play on the word “vacuum.”— New York Daily News"

In January 1936, tensions in Europe were up as the Italian front advanced and Red Cross hospitals were destroyed in bombings. Japan left the Naval Conference, prompting the United States and other Allied forces to begin talks of building up their naval forces. As the year continued, headlines would shift from aggressions by Germany to the battle between Japan and China, encompassing other localities in the Far East. In December 1937, Japan bombed several American ships, reportedly by accident.During the late spring and summer of 1937, reports began to show up in the headlines of blockades and attacks all across Europe.Meanwhile, in the United States, unions in almost every industry were striking for more pay, shorter work weeks and safer working conditions.In contrast, a short notice on the front page announced at Planters Co. on order of Planters President Amedeo Obici, all workers were given a full week vacation with pay in advance and told to have a good time as the plant shut down for the week.Locally, stories told of projects being completed with the sewer lines as well as several transportation projects. On Feb. 10, 1936, a proposal was made to the state highway department for the Hampton Roads Tunnel, consisting of a tunnel between Fort Monroe and Fort Wool and a bridge from Fort Wool to Willoughby Beach. The cost of the project was estimated at $8 million.In July 1937, City Council approved the test of light-controlled traffic signals to minimize traffic jams in the city. Col. John B. Pinner was the leading advocate of the traffic lights, petitioning anyone who questioned the need to come sit in his office, located at the head of Main Street, and observe the traffic congestion at Main and Washington.The city was seeing great economic rebounds from the Depression, and that could be noted easily in the business stories through the years.In May 1936, local businesses and financial institutions sponsored a Better Homes show and clinic to exhibit new techniques of building and inform and encourage the public to get FHA-insured mortgage loans. At the same time, a local group of doctors was holding clinics to inform the public about cancer. After heart disease, cancer was the biggest cause of medical death in 1936.The M and M Market opened at 170 E. Washington St. The grocery store was reported to be the prettiest food emporium by visitors the first day. This store was designed in the most modern style — “every article sold is displayed where it may be seen and where it may be reached with a minimum effort.”A couple of months later, a department store was announced. United Dollar Stores was to open on the corner of Main and Washington. The store advertised low prices between 5 cents and $5. It was planned to have a soda fountain and luncheonette.Opening price for peanuts on the Suffolk market was 5 cents a pound, the highest in nine years.Without fail, there is always a short gem to be found on the front pages. An interesting discovery was noted on June 8, 1936: “Monster Proves Puzzle To Scientists.” In Aberdeen, Wash., the remains of a 12-foot sea monster with a goat-like head baffled scientists. D.W. Black, a Baltimore zoologist who examined the 1,300-pound body, said he had never seen such an animal in his 16 years of research. The nose-less creature, he said, bore some resemblance to reconstructed skeletons of prehistoric animals. It had a body tapered like a buffalo, a four-foot tail similar to a muskrat, and a heavy, oily skin. Its 14 ribs, each about an inch and a half wide, were four inches apart.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_231,"Published 5:08 pm Friday, July 28, 2023ByLetters to the EditorEditor:Before I get to the meat of this opinion piece, let me shore up one common misconception that your average Joes and Janes may not know. Just as the Suffolk School Board works for the tax paying citizens of this city, the public schools superintendent works for the school board — not the other way around.The superintendent is their employee, and as such, John B.Gordon III, Ph.D., is to be evaluated by the school board members. My intention is not to rate the performance of Gordon, but to address the omission of two of those evaluations that were penned in earnest by the duly elected officials whose job is to rate his performance.On Thursday, July 13, it would appear that the Suffolk School Board chair actively allowed the total silencing of the two school board representatives for the Chuckatuck and HolyNeck Boroughs by completely tossing their evaluations of the SPS’s superintendent. The hostile and overly biased decision came after what appeared to be a very intense evaluation review stemming from a closed session.The question is, can or should the school board chair allow such an action to occur?What Virginia code or board policy allows him to either enforce or passively allow the complete and utter discrimination of two entire boroughs from the evaluation of the superintendent? The contentiousness of this action should leave constituents in both of these boroughs reeling because the evaluations of duly elected officials have been discarded, removing the citizens’ voice from the arena in one of the most important duties that school board members have: the superintendent’s evaluation.Citizens in these two boroughs should heavily question this very inappropriate and jaded choice in only accepting five of the seven board members’ evaluations. Voters in the Chuckatuck and HolyNeck voted their representatives into the office to be their voice when it comes to all business conducted on school board matters, and in one foul and very partisan move, these citizens’ representation endured being blatantly and subjectively curtailed. Moreover, in discarding or disregarding two board members’ evaluations of the superintendent, the board chair potentially skewed the final scoring results.Look at our country, state, and local governments. How far down this rabbit hole of subjugation do we have to go before citizens wake up and start holding their elected servants responsible for their actions?Citizens in both of these boroughs and the citizens of Suffolk as a whole need to know that the actions taken July 13 omitted your voice from the conversation and disallowed your board representative from being able to represent your interests in this matter.I advise you all to do the following. Call the School Board office and speak directly to the board chair, Tyron Riddick, or email him at tyronriddick@spsk12.net and relay to him your utter disgust and dissatisfaction with these events that lead to and occurred during the July 13 meeting. Demand a new closed meeting on the agenda for Aug. 10 to re-evaluate the superintendent to include all seven board member evaluations.In closing, let me simply state that from the School Board to the City Council, we, as the citizenry of Suffolk, need to re-engage in our civic duties to hold our public servants accountable. Despite tenure or delusions of grandeur, they all work for us. This country was at its strongest when the citizens were in control and knew their place at the top of the governmental food chain, and the politicians worked to serve. We can no longer allow titles to recklessly disregard our voices. The people of this city need to fill the city chambers with righteous ferocity, apply the unbearable pressure of reasonable expectations, and shift the winds that have forced our city off course.Rod ThompsonSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_120,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In trying to win support from recalcitrant Republicans to reform a badly broken immigration system, the Biden administration has reportedly indicated it’d be open to indefinite authorities to expel asylum seekers and a huge expansion of our already largely unaccountable detention system.This restrictionist approach will probably be framed as a compromise, as a breath of fresh air in a hyper-polarized environment. Yet it is worth pointing out that much of what’s on the table would have been considered an ultra-extreme position a decade ago, so heavy-handed that it would have been well outside the mainstream GOP, relegated to the radical fringes.These fringes included Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, often a lonesome voice for diehard anti-immigrant ideas at a time when conservative colleagues like Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham were negotiating for a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants. Sessions was known to have long and spirited discussions around shutting down immigration with his then-communications director, a young Republican agitator named Stephen Miller.Years later, Sessions would be attorney general and Miller one of the most powerful people in the Trump White House, tasked with turning these years of discussions into policy. Miller was more or less directly responsible for that administration’s most egregious infamies, including the family separation policy. Much of what he drew up, including the Title 42 expulsion policy, is a direct predecessor to what’s now being considered.At the time, these policies were rightly and roundly condemned by Democrats, not to mention civil libertarians, human rights groups and others. It’s dismaying to see the Biden administration now sign off on the same. Everyone agrees that we need a shift in approach to immigration, but this isn’t the way to do it.It’s all the more embarrassing that this is all being considered as a trade for aid to Ukraine, an ally at current, dire risk of being subsumed into the imperialist ambitions of Vladimir Putin.People around the world are inspired by the tenacity of the Ukrainian population as it’s fought, for nearly two years now, to fend off the annexation effort of the despot’s armies.Admirable as their resolve is, ultimate victory is far from assured, and successes so far have been largely predicated on significant international support, including weapons and financial assistance.Some try to tarnish globe-trotting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as some kind of narcissist basking in the limelight, but it’s clear that the fatigue-clad wartime leader would rather be at home with his troops. The reason that Zelenskyy went to Washington last week, the reason he keeps coming back and showing up at international conferences and summits is because he knows that the continued support from the world community and the United States in particular is instrumental to the war effort.Congressional Republicans know this, and they are aware of the implications of denying Ukraine aid to score some domestic political points and implement their extreme immigration agenda. Even as the Senate works to reach a deal, the House GOP seems uninterested, because ultimately they don’t care much about the long-term implications of a Ukrainian loss.All that matters is pleasing the base.— New York Daily NewsRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Who knew that studying espionage history is a thing?

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_177,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°At the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP28 this year, decision-makers won’t just talk about change. They’ll taste it. COP28 (Nov. 30–Dec. 12 will offer a predominantly vegan menu, reflecting a growing awareness of how meat, eggs and dairy contribute to the climate catastrophe. Let’s hope this mounting understanding will inspire everyone to go vegan — before it’s too late.A global shift to vegan eating is imperative. The just-released Fifth National Climate Assessment by the U.S. Global Change Research Program found that we’re not on track to meet the U.N.-approved target of keeping global warming below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. This is alarming. Scientists fear that if the Earth heats up beyond this point, it will become difficult for life to adapt and thrive.The assessment also reveals that extreme heatwaves, hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters are becoming more intense and frequent, and these events can result in a catastrophic loss of life and destruction of property. The stark conclusion is that immediate, bold action is necessary to mitigate the escalating threat of climate-related crises.Eliminating animal agriculture is “our best and most immediate chance to reverse the trajectory of climate change,” according to research published in PLOS Climate. This new model shows that a worldwide shift away from animal agriculture in the next 15 years would have the same effect as a 68% reduction of CO2 emissions through the year 2100.A recent study in Nature Food recommends government policy interventions that would reduce meat consumption. This study shows that compared with individuals who consume 100 grams of meat daily, those who eat vegan reduce their climate-heating emissions, water pollution and land use by 75%. It also found that vegan eating cuts the destruction of wildlife by 66%.In addition to being eco-friendly, vegan eating is the most ethically responsible choice. Factory farming inflicts unimaginable suffering on animals, forces them into cramped and unsanitary living conditions and subjects them to routine mutilations and harsh confinement.The lives of these animals are plagued with stress, pain and deprivation, from crowded cages for hens to tightly packed pens for pigs and cows.And the use of growth-promoting drugs and antibiotics worsens their suffering — and poses risks to human health.Consuming meat, eggs and dairy is a recipe for experiencing a variety of health issues — heart disease, obesity, cancer and diabetes, to name a few.Leading health experts agree that going vegan is the epitome of self-care. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics echoes this sentiment, affirming that well-planned vegan eating meets nutritional needs and confers myriad health benefits. Going vegan is a prescription for personal and planetary well-being.The vegan menu at COP28 serves as a beacon of hope and should inspire everyone to go vegan before the consequences of the climate catastrophe become irreversible. So, may our collective shift toward vegan eating become a catalyst for change.May it be a declaration that echoes around the globe — a promise to nurture the planet, live with compassion and secure a sustainable future for all.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.CHICAGO — Vice presidential candidate Tim Walz led fellow Democrats in a political pep rally on Wednesday night, vowing that he and presidential running mate Kamala Harris would triumph over Republican Donald Trump in November’s U.S. election."
suffolknewsherald_2023_88,"Published 5:56 pm Friday, March 24, 2023ByStaff ReportsAs the season of Lent is in full swing for all Christians worldwide, a local pastor with 40 years of priesthood has summoned the congregation or faith community who gathered together to celebrate with him at the only Catholic church, St. Mary’s of the Presentation Catholic Church, established in 1909, in Suffolk. He answered the call to serve God and the community of believers.The Rev. Father Rogelio “Ongen” Largoza, a Filipino priest of the Diocese of Richmond, celebrated his 40 years of priesthood and 65 years of life with a solemn Mass at the historic church in downtown Suffolk, Monday, March 20, the first day of spring.The celebration was joyfully and faithfully attended by his fellow pastors and former parishioners from different parishes in Virginia, friends, siblings and relatives, who came all the way from New Jersey, San Diego and the Philippines.As the main celebrant of the Mass and pastor of St. Mary’s, Fr. Ongen, as he is fondly called, welcomed and thanked everyone who, despite their busy schedules, attended the special occasion in his honor.He also thanked the church’s choir, under Ms. Francis, for the beautiful liturgical music, and the young altar servers “who happened to be four brothers and were not even parishioners from the parish, but they will be,” he jokingly said.During the well-attended lively Mass, invited homilist Monsignor Juan S. Celso, a friend of Fr. Ongen from the Diocese of Alabama, and fellow pastor originally from the Diocese of Nueva Caceres in the Philippines, quoted Matthew 14:27-29, “Do not be afraid…come.” He spoke about himself briefly being a priest, and the celebrant who, a priest for 40 years, has to undergo and encounter many challenges along the way in proclaiming and bringing the Good News to all people from different places and parishes where he is dutifully and faithfully assigned.Msgr. Celso said Fr. Ongen answered that call to be “single” throughout his life just so he can be fully of service to God, to bring the Good News of salvation through his begotten son, Jesus Christ.The preacher-homilist also mentioned about St. Joseph, the spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and foster father of Jesus, since the day coincides with the solemnity of St. Joseph, patron saint of the universal church.After Mass, Fr. Ongen invited the whole congregation to a reception in the church’s Social Hall where food and drinks were served by St. Mary’s staff and volunteer parishioners.While the faith community or congregation were enjoying food and fellowship, a slide show presentation was also shown highlighting Fr. Ongen’s 40 years of pastoral service and ministry in various parishes in the United States, the Philippines and the Caribbean.The church’s parish council chair, under the leadership of Chris Francis, presented Fr. Ongen at the reception with a gift, a framed painting of St. Mary’s altar by a Suffolk artist-parishioner. Fr. Ongen thanked Francis for his active church involvement and stewardship.Members of St. Mary’s Knights of Columbus council 7363 were also present to grace the special occasion.To Rev. Fr. Ongen, happy 40th ordination anniversary and 65th birthday. May you continue to be a faithful servant of God.

suffolknewsherald_2023_67,"Published 5:29 pm Tuesday, April 18, 2023ByLetters to the EditorEditor:In the upcoming Virginia Senate 17th District Republican primary, inexperienced candidate Hermie Sadler seems to be running with limited skills that have nothing to do with community service.His first skill is being an ex-professional NASCAR driver for 26 years, a skill that entailed driving an expensive race car around an oval track, as fast as he can, always steering left. Unfortunately, even with financial backing from sponsors like the lottery, he only managed to win two minor events in over 300 races.The second skill sounds better, “business executive.” Starting in 2019, he assumed leadership of the Sadler family fuel and food empire, a business that’s been successfully operating since 1946. New chief executives of most companies carry heavy workloads. So how is it that the company can spare him from his leadership role for the extended periods of time needed to render senatorial duties? The job of state senator is a real commitment requiring time-consuming dedication if done right.The third skill was proudly touted by Hermie when he first announced his intent to run. He has filed a lawsuit against the same commonwealth he now wishes to serve. In 2021, the state legislature placed restrictions on “skilled gaming machines.” His company filed a lawsuit to prevent the machines from being taken out of his company’s locations. The lawsuit has not been settled, but since there is a chance of failure, he now wants to be a senator who can influence new “gambling machine” legislation. According to him, “skilled gaming machines are a win-win for business and the commonwealth.”Fortunately, in this primary we can choose a candidate with tested conservative skills that matter. Emily Brewer has been active in the Republican Party for over a decade, serving us well the past six years in the House of Delegates. She has entered two races and won two races. She knows how to run and win political races ethically and without subterfuge.Emily Brewer has earned our respect the old-fashioned way, through hard work, long hours and dedication to all of her constituents. She answers calls and emails, doing it with a servant’s heart. She promises representation, not a self-serving agenda.

suffolknewsherald_2023_159,"Published 4:52 pm Tuesday, January 10, 2023ByJen JaquaEditor’s note: This weekly column series focuses on the history of the Suffolk News-Herald and the news of Suffolk as it was told on its pages.Read part 1 hereIn June of 1950, the newspaper moved to its longtime South Saratoga Street building, where it would undergo many changes and be brought into the digital age.The newspaper has changed ownership several times over the years, maintaining its name and reputation as a reliable source of Suffolk news.Obici sold the paper to R.A Harry Aug. 1, 1939. Harry was originally from the Tidewater region of Virginia and had owned and operated newspapers in Tennessee prior to taking ownership of the News-Herald. He held the paper for two years, then sold it to C. Marshall Johnston and Associates, Aug. 1, 1941. Johnston was from a well known newspaper family in West Virginia. His wife was from Norfolk. He expanded coverage almost immediately.At the beginning of 1943, in the midst of World War II, Johnston sold the paper to W.J. Missett and Charles Hodel, of Beckley, West Virginia. Johnston had been in the newspaper business at various other papers around the country, having started as a reporter and ad salesman in Pennsylvania.Eighteen years later, as the Cold War heated up and the first troops were sent to Vietnam, Missett and Beckley sold the paper to William C. Thomas and Associates, from Bristol. The main stock holders in the company were T. Eugene Worrell and Carmage Walls.It was while Worrell and Walls owned the company that future owner Jim Boone would spend time as publisher of the News-Herald.Worrell became sole owner of the paper in the 1970s, selling to Media General of Richmond, Oct 27, 1995. Just as the rest of the world began to go digital, so did the paper.During the five years Media General owned the paper, many changes happened. The Suffolk press was removed in 1998, and the paper began to be printed at a sister paper in Ahoskie, North Carolina. The age of digital had begun.In 2000, Boone Newsmedia Inc., current owner of the Suffolk News-Herald, bought the paper from Media General. Jim Boone, majority owner of Boone Newsmedia Inc., was publisher of the Suffolk News-Herald from 1961-1968.Boone Newsmedia continued the journey into the digital news era. Its website, suffolknewsherald.com, went live April 1, 2001 and has provided the most up-to-date news around the clock since. These days nearly everything can be done online, from submitting a news tip to reading this column. But behind it all is hardworking, dedicated reporters and staff making sure that while the times have changed, the quality of news has not.Suffolk Living Magazine, a feature magazine, was launched in 2009. It is now published six times per year, with about 6,000 copies distributed for free to locations around the city.In 2018, amid rising costs of newsprint, Saturday publication of the Suffolk News-Herald was dropped. In 2020, the paper became a twice-weekly publication in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic hardships felt across the industry.On Aug. 4, 2020, an EF-1 tornado spawned by Hurricane Isaias severely damaged 130 S. Saratoga St., the longtime home of the paper, requiring a temporary relocation to the current office at 157 N. Main St. The Saratoga Street building was later sold to a developer that turned it into apartments.Digital copies of the Suffolk News-Herald have been archived by the Virginia Chronicle and are available for the public to view going back to Aug. 1, 1927, at virginiachronicle.com. More current digital copies of the paper starting in March of 2020 are available at suffolknewsherald.com.In celebration of 150 years of newspaper publication, I am going to dig into the archives and highlight headlines and information from throughout the years presenting a unique look at how this newspaper has provided news for Suffolk about Suffolk. Check back here each Wednesday as we journey together through the decades.Historical information for this column and those that follow in this series has been gathered through the digital versions of Suffolk News-Herald and The Tidewater News archives at virginiachronicle.com, as well as a special Suffolk Bi-Centenial edition published Oct. 2, 1942.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_161,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°As President Joe Biden founders in the polls, he’s decided to revive a hackneyed progressive standby: The rampant inflation Americans have experienced under his administration is actually the fault of evil corporations.“Let me be clear,” Biden said Monday. “To any corporation that has not brought their prices back down — even as inflation has come down, even as supply chains have been rebuilt — it’s time to stop the price gouging.”Perhaps the president is merely test driving a new campaign slogan — “The Biden White House: Where deflecting blame is elevated above accountability” — but the idea that Biden and congressional Democrats had no hand in triggering the highest inflation in the past 40 years is sidesplitting.Despite signs that the economy was recovering nicely from the pandemic, the president and the Democratic Congress insisted on an unprecedented multitrillion-dollar spending blowout during 2021 to reward their favored special interests. The result, as many economists predicted, was the return of high inflation — with a vengeance.Yet even as prices soared, Biden and his economic team remained in denial.“There’s nobody suggesting there’s unchecked inflation on the way — no serious economist,” the president famously remarked in July 2021. A year later, inflation exceeded 9 percent and the White House dropped the term “transitory” from its talking points.Biden’s comments on Monday indicate he remains confused. While the yearly inflation rate has fallen — it hit 3.2 percent in October — prices have not gone “back down.”They aren’t rising as quickly as they were last year, but they remain elevated, as any shopper or driver — or voter — will tell you. An actual month-to-month reduction in prices is called “deflation,” which, in the long term, can trigger a drop in production and consumer spending.In addition, the higher interest rates the Fed inflicted on consumers in an effort to quell inflation have led to elevated mortgage rates and credit card interest payments, further burdening the middle and lower class. Higher interest payments on the debt are also eating up a massive portion of government outlays.It’s understandable from a political standpoint that Biden would prefer to lay all this on the lap of Big Business and those dastardly capitalists.But it’s revealing that the president never explains why these nefarious actors decided — after 40 years of hiding in the weeds, biding their time — to unleash their devilish “price gouging” scheme only when he won the Oval Office.Biden is hoping his “the-buck-stops-over-there” posturing pays electoral dividends. Polls show that voters — paying $5 for a gallon of gasoline and $6 for a loaf of bread — may have other ideas.—Las Vegas Review-Journal/TNS"
suffolknewsherald_2023_30,"Published 5:08 pm Tuesday, June 6, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldWe challenge any community to make crime-fighting as much fun as Suffolk makes it each year on National Night Out.Organizers already are gearing up for the Aug. 1 event, with a kickoff event set for 6 p.m. Tuesday in council chambers at City Hall, 442 W. Washington St.It might seem odd to refer to a citywide party as a crime-fighting effort, but behind all the cornhole and hot dogs — behind the dunk tanks and talent shows, the water balloons and barbecues — National Night Out is all about communities coming together, and that’s the very essence of a successful anti-crime effort.Communities, after all, do not reduce their crime rates solely because of the hard work of good police departments. Some of the best and largest police departments in the nation exist in places where crime rates are high. Without the support of their community and without the community’s commitment to stamping out crime, even the best police officers face an uphill battle.National Night Out exists to help encourage those community traits — to introduce neighbors to one another, to help build relationships between neighborhoods and the police officers who serve them and to help both residents and officers recognize and pursue new opportunities for partnerships.Millions of people in thousands of communities across the United States, U.S. territories, Canadian cities and military bases worldwide participate in National Night Out every year.Neighborhoods and communities throughout Suffolk hold a plethora of activities, including cookouts, ice cream socials, flashlight parades, block parties, contests and more. A caravan of city and law enforcement officials visit the various communities to meet and greet residents and forge relationships.Suffolk’s collective celebration has ranked in the top 10 nationwide for more than a decade in its population category and received first-in-the-nation awards in 2008, 2009, 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2022.If you’ve not participated in the past, make it a priority this year.

suffolknewsherald_2023_227,"Published 4:59 pm Tuesday, December 5, 2023ByStaff ReportsAdvent season has begun for Christians worldwide, with the first Sunday on Dec. 3.(The season highlights the Advent wreath in a perfect circle, symbolizing the eternity of God. It’s distinctly displayed at the altar of every church. In it are four outer candles (three purple and one pink or violet and one large white candle at the center. These candles symbolize the virtues that Jesus Christ brings to all the faithful and believers: HOPE, PEACE, JOY, and LOVE.One of the four small candles of the Advent wreath was lit on Dec. 3. Another one will be lit on Dec. 10, the second Sunday of Advent; then another candle is lit on the 3rd Sunday, Dec. 17, and the fourth on the fourth Sunday, Dec, 24, Christmas Eve. On Christmas Day, all four outer candles will be lit, in addition to the large white candle at the center of the wreath, symbolizing Jesus Christ, the world’s Light that shines in or guides one’s life amid the darkness and chaos in his/her life. The four-week season of Advent offers the faithful believers the opportunity to prepare themselves religiously and spiritually for Christ’s coming into the world again.What is Advent? The name was adopted from the Latin “advents,” meaning “coming or arrival” of a notable person, thing, or event. For all Christian communities around the world, it’s simply the four-week season of preparation, reflection, and remembrance leading up to the celebration of the birth of Jesus on Earth on Christmas Day.For Advent to be meaningful and life-changing for all believers and followers of Jesus Christ, the words of the Holy Father, Pope Francis, should be considered.“Advent reawakens in us the memory of Christ’s historical coming and the expectation of his return. Isaiah addresses people who have passed through a dark period and been subjected to a very difficult trial. But now the time of comfort has come. Sorrow and fear can be replaced with joy, for the Lord himself will guide his people on the way to liberation and salvation … He will in fact, provide unity and security and feed his flock, gather the lost sheep into his sure fold, reserving special attention to the most fragile and weak. This is God’s attitude toward us, his creatures. For this reason, Isaiah invites those who hear him—including us, today—to spread this message of hope: that the Lord consoles us. And to make room for the comfort which comes from the Lord.”(Amid the current wars between Ukraine and Russia and in the Middle East, particularly the Israel-Palestine conflict, humankind can only hope for peace and justice, healing and reconciliation, during the Advent season, while world leaders continue to negotiate and mediate and (try to work together to achieve (or maintain peace and justice around the world, particularly to the aforementioned nations at war and other countries in crisis and conflict. As the Advent season continues leading up to Christmas, the world clamors for “peace on earth, goodwill to all humanity.” With hope, the whole world anticipates the commemoration and celebration of the arrival or birth of Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Word of God (John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us on Christmas Day (as echoed and heralded by the angels in Luke 2:14, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men” .Jesus is the Messiah who brings “peace” on earth and goodwill to men. That’s undeniably the hope of every believer, follower, disciple of Jesus Christ. He is the peace that the world longs for.In his address to the U.S. Congress in 2015, Pope Francis said, “Our world is increasingly a place of violent conflict, hatred and brutal atrocities, committed even in the name of God and of religion. Our response must be one of hope and healing, of justice and peace. Our efforts must aim at restoring hope, righting wrongs, maintaining commitments, and thus promoting peace and the well-being of individuals and of peoples in a renewed spirit of fraternity and solidarity, cooperating generously for the common good.”What can you and I do during the observance of Advent season? Praying, Scripture reading, Gospel reflection, attending Sunday Mass or going to church, doing simple acts of charity and love, praying the Holy Rosary, and increasing devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary (Mother of Jesus and our spiritual mother .Praying is a good start. It’s a religious and spiritual practice, a good, healthy habit that the faithful and religious leaders like Pope Francis of the Catholic Church advocate. He invites everyone to pray Our Daily Advent Prayer: Let us open our hearts to receive the grace of this Advent season, which is Christ himself, whom God our Father has revealed to the entire world. Where God is born, hope is born. Where God is born, peace is born. And where peace is born, there is no longer room for hatred and for war. God alone can save us and free us from the many forms of evil and selfishness in our midst. Let us welcome into our lives God’s mercy, which Jesus Christ has bestowed on us, so that we in turn can show mercy to our brothers and sisters. In this way, we will make peace grow!May your Advent be blessed and filled with faith, praise and prayer, hope and healing, charity and compassion, justice and peace, love and joy!Chris A.

suffolknewsherald_2023_179,"Published 8:08 pm Tuesday, October 3, 2023ByJen JaquaSafety was the topic in 1994 and ’95. In February of ’94, local law enforcement and the DMV teamed up to help reduce toddler death and injury with car seat inspections. DMV had collected almost 700 unsafe child safety seats because of missing or broken pieces.In March, a report came out detailing school violence and weapons. In ’94, Suffolk used specially-trained dogs, random searches, and metal detectors, to name just a few solutions. Other Hampton Roads municipalities that were originally skeptical of Suffolk’s ideas later began to adopt the same strategies. “I’m not surprised the numbers are so low because of our stringent enforcement policy,” said Milton Liverman, Suffolk coordinator of pupil personnel and testing. “We try to stay on top of things and follow up all leads to keep violence out of the schools.” State officials agree that combating violence is crucial to improving the educational standards of Virginia’s schools. “Schools have to be free of violence and potential harm,” said Dr. William C. Bosher Jr., Superintendent of Public Instruction for Virginia. “If the students and staff do not feel safe, then English, mathematics, science and social studies do not matter.”Just as in the schools, children need to be safe while playing. In April of ’94, in a step to alleviate heightened concern over lead contamination in playgrounds throughout Hampton Roads, Suffolk conducted random tests as an assurance. “We are certainly pleased to report to the community that our equipment — to the best of our knowledge — is lead-free,” said City Parks and Recreation Director Dinesh Tiwari.Changes in laws and regulations resulted in several big changes in schools. Several modifications will come about as a result of laws passed by the 1994 General Assembly, including smaller class sizes in grades K-3; an expansion of the state’s anti-smoking law in schools, and the introduction of student-initiated prayer. School meals changed thanks to new standards by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Suffolk also began implementing a new technology program that put computers in every elementary school In the city. Council approved the transfer of $225,000 to install 10 CD-ROM computers and software in each of the 10 elementary schools.As children returned to school, an elementary school organized an event for kindergarten student’s moms. “After the Kilby Shores mothers drop off their kindergartners, they have been invited by the school business partner, McDonald’s on Route 58, to attend what is being called a ‘Boo-Hoo’ party. McDonald’s will have some coffee and Danish ready for our mothers after they drop off their children so that they can commiserate with one another.”Another change in the Suffolk schools in ’94 was for the first time a police officer, Det. Andre Weaver began patrolling the hallways of Nansemond River High School.The following year, in September of ’95, a new preschool Early Start program began at Mt. Zion and Booker T. Washington elementary schools. Sixty children were enrolled in this new 4-year-old preschool agenda. The students attended class in mobile units at the schools. Also new for the ’95 school year was the block scheduling concept that began at both Lakeland and Nansemond River high schools. The 90-minute classes were implemented for the purpose of more time for hands-on application of textbook theory.In October of 1995, in what would go down in history as the largest gathering of Black men in Washington, D.C., the Million Man March, over 800,000 gathered in the Nation’s capital. Suffolk was well represented, having sent several busloads of participants.As 1995 drew to a close in December, cable TV viewers got an unwelcome surprise. “The intrusion of an X-rated movie channel into the homes of several Falcon Cable subscribers in Suffolk is sending out a bad signal. Known as the “Spice” channel, subscribers who want to see it pay an extra monthly cost. But according to a Holland area resident who did not wish to be named, the channel came in loud and clear for most of the day Saturday and much of Monday, without any invitation from her.”On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_82,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°The fight against climate change commands the support of governments across much of the world. Targets for carbon abatement have gotten more ambitious and policies to address the challenge are proliferating. Yet one measure of progress shows how badly these efforts still fall short. Last year, global fossil-fuel subsidies expanded to a new record — $7 trillion, roughly 7% of global gross domestic output.This remarkable number comes from a recently updated assessment by the International Monetary Fund, drawing on detailed disaggregated data for 170 countries. Rightly, it uses a comprehensive definition of subsidy, combining outright support (spending that offsets production costs and implicit support (underpricing for environmental harms and forgone tax revenue .Explicit subsidies have more than doubled since the previous assessment for 2020, to more than $1 trillion, thanks partly to efforts to soften the blow of higher energy prices after Russia attacked Ukraine. Implicit subsidies, some 80% of the total, surged as well — and unlike the explicit kind, they’re on track to rise further, both in dollar terms and as a share of global output, by the end of the decade.One result of these enormous supports is that policies are often at cross-purposes. Keeping fossil fuels cheap offsets the other taxes, subsidies, and regulations governments use to reduce emissions and promote clean energy. In effect, with some of their policies, governments push fossil-fuel demand in the right direction; then, with generous subsidies for pollution and climate change, they push it back.The gap between efficient prices and actual prices is especially egregious in the case of coal — which is both a potent driver of global climate change and in many countries a main cause of local air pollution. According to one authoritative estimate, outdoor air pollution resulted in 4.5 million premature deaths in 2019. The IMF finds that 80% of global coal consumption was priced at less than half its true cost in 2022.Insisting that people pay full price for fuel would not only reduce consumption and slash emissions. It would also align that purpose with greater economic efficiency. First, it would make plain that some fossil fuels are worse than others, differences that can and should be priced accordingly. It would also provide a transparent basis for more effective international cooperation. Because air pollution and climate change both count in the calculations, efficient fossil-fuel prices vary from country to country according to local circumstances — but the gap between true costs and actual prices provides a consistent yardstick. Finally, cutting subsidies raises revenue, which allows for higher spending on worthwhile goals, lower government borrowing and/or cuts in other taxes.No doubt governments will blame politics for the current dysfunction: Making fossil fuels more expensive is unpopular. This excuse is hardly compelling, since the existing subsidies could be put to better and more popular use. Still, if politics is indeed the obstacle, the rise in fossil-fuel prices since 2020 provides an opportunity. Instead of letting prices subside in due course all the way back to the pre-Ukraine norm, governments could withdraw or offset their existing subsidies at the same time, narrowing the gap with true costs without forcing prices higher.The new assessment shows that the numbers involved aren’t rounding errors. They’re enormous — and enormously counter-productive. Working to reduce and then eliminate fossil-fuel subsidies should be an overriding priority for governments everywhere.— Bloomberg OpinionHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_116,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Humans have sailed the world’s oceans for thousands of years, but they haven’t all reached port. Researchers estimate that there are some three million shipwrecks worldwide, resting in shallow rivers and bays, coastal waters and the deep ocean. Many sank during catastrophes – some during storms or after running aground, others in battle or collisions with other vessels.Shipwrecks like the RMS Titanic, RMS Lusitania and USS Monitor conjure tales of human courage and sacrifice, sunken treasure and unsolved mysteries. But there’s another angle to their stories that doesn’t feature humans.•••A NEW HOME FOR UNDERWATER LIFEShips are typically made of metal or wood. When a vessel sinks, it adds foreign, artificial structure to the seafloor.For example, the World War II tanker E.M. Clark sank on a relatively flat, sandy seabed in 1942 when it was torpedoed by a German submarine. To this day, the intact metal wreck looms over the North Carolina seafloor like an underwater skyscraper, creating an island oasis in the sand.The creatures that reside on and around sunken ships are so diverse and abundant that scientists often colloquially call these sites “living shipwrecks.” Marine life ranging from microscopic critters to some of the largest animals in the sea use shipwrecks as homes. Brilliantly colored corals and sponges blanket the wrecks’ surfaces. Silvery schools of baitfish dart and shimmer around the structures, chased by sleek, fast-moving predators. Sharks sometimes cruise around wrecks, likely resting or looking for prey.•••THE ORIGIN OF A SECOND LIFEA ship’s transformation from an in-service vessel into a thriving metropolis for marine life can seem like a fairy tale. It has a once-upon-a-time origin story – the wrecking event – and a sequence of life arriving on the sunken structure and beginning to blossom.Tiny microbes invisible to the naked human eye initially settle on the wreck’s surface, forming a carpet of cells, called a biofilm. This coating helps to make the wreck structure suitable for larval animals like sponges and corals to settle and grow there.Larger animals like fish sometimes appear within minutes after a ship sinks. Small fish hide in the structure’s cracks and crevices, while large sharks glide around it. Sea turtles and marine mammals such as fur seals have also been spotted on wrecks.••••HOT SPOTS FOR BIODIVERSITYShipwrecks host quantities and varieties of marine life that can make them hot spots for biodiversity. The microbes that transform the wreck structure into habitat also enrich the surrounding sand. Evidence from deep Gulf of Mexico wrecks shows that a halo of increased microbial diversity radiates outward anywhere from 650 to 1,000 feet (200-300 meters from the wreck. In the Atlantic Ocean, thousands of grouper, a type of reef fish highly valued by fishers, congregate around and inside shipwrecks.In the deep sea, life growing on shipwrecks can even generate energy. Tube worms that grow on organic shipwreck materials such as paper, cotton and wood host symbiotic bacteria that produce chemical energy. Such tube worm colonies have been documented in the Gulf of Mexico on the steel luxury yacht Anona.•••THE FUTURE OF SHIPWRECK EXPLORATIONShipwrecks create millions of study sites that scientists can use to ask questions about marine life and habitats. One of the greatest challenges is that many wrecks are undiscovered or in remote locations. Advances in technology can help researchers see into the most inaccessible areas of the ocean, not only to find shipwrecks but to better understand their biology.Ultimately, the more we learn, the more effectively we can conserve these historical and biological gems.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."

Hopefully, you’ll be transformed to a new you, filled with hope, peace, love and charity.With belief and trust in the divine mercy, Jesus, our Lord and Savior-God, you’ll be at peace with yourself and others, and fearless to face life’s insurmountable challenges, changes and crises.“Thank you, Lord, for today and tomorrow. I am grateful and so blessed to be alive. Help me to do your will, to observe the Ten Commandments. Strengthen my faith in You always. Jesus, I believe and trust in You. This I ask, through the intercession of all the good angels and saints, with Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen.”Mama Mary or Mother Mary, mother of God, Jesus Christ, is our spiritual mother and patroness of the Americas and the universal church.We pray: “Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus! Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us, sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.”St. Joseph, head of the holy family, Jesus’s foster father, our spiritual father and patron saint of the universal church, is one quiet saint who, we fathers especially, can inspire us to be good and responsible fathers.To help protect our children and our families, our church and our world, let’s pray to St. Joseph, the terror of demons: “Saint Joseph, Terror of Demons, cast your solemn gaze upon the devil and all his minions, and protect us with your mighty staff. You fled through the night to avoid the devil’s wicked designs; now with the power of God, smite the demons as they flee from you! Grant special protection, we pray for children, fathers, families, and the dying. By God’s grace, no demon dares approach while you are near, so we beg of you, always be near us! Amen.”As a peace-loving child of God, I love praying the Peace Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi: “Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is sadness, joy. O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.”St. Therese (the Little Flower of Lisieux, the Carmelite nun and doctor of the church, said, “For me, prayer is an aspiration of the heart; it is a simple glance directed to heaven; it is a cry of gratitude and love in the midst of trial as well as joy; finally, it is something great, supernatural, which expands my soul and unites me to Jesus.”Prayers can do wonders. They can heal and help you recover. They can transform you and inspire you to do good or better for yourself and others. Try praying simple prayers, such as: “Thank you, God.” “Thank you, Jesus.” “Lord, help me…(mention what you hope/want to see/be done in your life .”Wherever you are, keep on praying, stay focused and don’t give up.“Pray, hope and don’t worry. Pray with perseverance, trust and a serene and calm mind,” said Padre Pio. “Prayer is the best weapon we have; it is the key that opens God’s heart.”-Chris A.

leoweekly_2023_2,"I m almost 9,000 miles from My Old Kentucky Home, and I will never return.A few years ago, Harvard University put out a study saying that Kentucky is the most corrupt state in the union. I smirked when I read that and said aloud, In other news, water is wet. As a native son of Kentucky, I reserve the right to always criticize the state that took me 45 years to flee.There really is something attractive about the smell of horse shit in the air and the rank corruption that permeates every single facet of what they call the justice system there. Christian theocrat Kim Davis refused a marriage license to a gay couple when she was the country clerk. The two men hired my father to sue her, and after she had climbed up on the cross to die a martyr, Mike Hee-Haw Huckabee came to Kentucky to raise her hand up in praise to the Almighty. Kim Davis looked towards heaven and raised her hand in a victory that her bigotry had been rewarded by Pastor Huckabee. After Davis got her proverbial ass kicked up, down, and all around in court, she and the State of Kentucky were forced to pay for their religious bigotry to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars.I have many such tales of villainous and naked corruption of people seeking office in Kentucky, but since today is Election Day, I want to focus on just the one, Daniel Cameron. The current governor, Andy Beshear, was the attorney general before he became governor, and his father was the governor as well. To be fair, I have criticism that can be laid at Andy s feet, and if you don t know what I am talking about, you can google the Kentucky State Police commissioner, and you can watch my father deposing the bastard on YouTube. In Andy s defense, he had to pick a good ol boy commissioner, but this is about Daniel Cameron, who is a real threat not just to Kentucky, but to the nation.The first time I heard about Daniel Cameron, it was from someone who went to law school with him, a fellow Louisvillian. It was shocking to me that he would recommend such a bastard, because I know Kentucky Republicans too well, but my associate assured me that he was a good man and that he should be supported. Well,thishomey don t play dat. I do not ever support crooks, and all I needed to know was that he was supported by Mitch McConnell and was the protege McConnell hopes will replace him in the Senate.Daniel Cameron is as crooked as any other Republican who has to have his pants screwed onto him every morning. Cameron is an aloof, unaware, oblivious, and obsequious Trump whore. He has proven to be wholly incompetent and entirely amoral, and he has the ethics of a honey badger on crack. There is no there, there to the man. There is a void between his ears which destroys knowledge and intelligence with the relative ease of a black hole destroying light.Most Kentuckians will not remember when Barbara Whaley was presenting evidence before a grand jury after the murder of Breonna Taylor. Most prosecutors are very proud to state that their conviction rate is in the 90th percentile, but not Barbara. I was so certain of her certain failure to convict the reported serial rapist Brett Hankison that I congratulated her a month before the trial began at her losing another easily winnable caseyet again.Barbara Whaley works for the Attorney General s Office in Frankfort. She was given the duty to investigate the murder of Breonna Taylor, but what most Kentuckians do not know is that she was sent to investigate by Daniel Cameron. Anyone and everyone who knew Barbara knew that there would be no real investigation. There was a big show of her making a presentation to a special grand jury, but this was likely all a show for an angry populace who wanted some accountability. Barbara Whaley didn t even ask for any indictments, and she likely had no intention of asking for any, either.What Kentuckians also do not know is that the Fraternal Order of Police is singularly the most powerful political organization in Kentucky. They have a lot of members and money to donate to political candidates like Cameron, and they did. It s not their money, incidentally; it s your money.You see, one of the scams that the Fraternal Order of Police in Kentucky run is the impound lots. The FOP endorsement is needed by any political candidate, and one of the biggest sources of revenues for the FOP is impound lots. Oh, you d think that money goes to the state like it does in almost every other state, and you re wrong. All of the money raised by the impound lots goes to the police retirement fund, which is already funded by the state. Speculation is that this is a separate fund that is run by the FOP for things like $5,000 dinners at popular steakhouses with Chateau Lafitte Rothschild on the menu at $500 a bottle or Dom Perignon. (I know, I ve served them before. Daniel Cameron, who desperately wants to be governor and senator after his terms, is not and has no intention of alienating the second-largest voting blocks in Kentucky, with teachers being the first. Teachers just don t have a crooked union that s as bad as any mafia family Mario Puzo could write about. Barbara Whaley brought a single Wanton Endangerment charge against the alleged serial rapist Brett Hankison, for which he was acquitted, but since Hankison had multiple allegations of rape against him in his Internal Affairs file, when he went to the normal rubber-stamp arbitration hearing, thanks to the FOP s special clause with the city contract, his firing remained and was not overturned. Two of the other officers retired with full pension; one went to work in Carroll County, where he has already been in the news for a hit-and-run accident under mysterious circumstances where hemighthave been driving drunk.One of the more important details in the Breonna Taylor case was that her former boyfriend had given her $10,000 in cash to hold for him. Nothing was ever said or spoken about the $10,000, but the attorney general sure did know about the allegations of the cops making some extra cash on the side by robbing drug money.But again, Daniel Cameron is an ambitious man, and as I said before, he is entirely amoral. He is also a religious nutter who wants to impose the most draconian abortion bill nationally, which is why he steadfastly refused to say anything about it because he saw how that turned out in both Kansas and Ohio when religious nutters tried to pass a six-week ban.Mitch McConnell knows how to get his protege to do what he wants, and he has. But Cameron is about as popular as syphilis in a cheap New Orleans whorehouse. There is little that could possibly defeat his naked ambition for higher office.Truly, I do not say this with any sense of irony at all, Daniel Cameron would fornicate with a snake on live television while eating a barbecued baby if he thought it would get him a win of any kind. There simply aren t enough superlatives to convey in any language I am aware of that can convey what a scumbag Daniel Cameron is. ( ."
suffolknewsherald_2023_10,"Published 6:22 pm Tuesday, June 27, 2023ByJen JaquaDuring an annual dinner meeting in 1969 for the Suffolk Nansemond County Chamber of Commerce, Richard S. Gillis Jr., executive director of the Virginia State Chamber of Commerce, made several predictions about how things would be in another 50 years. Included in those predictions was that the Suffolk and Nansemond County area would become an integral part of a metropolitan Hampton Roads. The population here would grow from 48,000 to more than 100,000. (The estimated population of Suffolk in 2019 was 92,277. Other predictions included that, for all practical purposes, there would be one city extending from Suffolk to the ocean. While the various cities might want to preserve their separate identities, they would band together on many things — including a regional chamber of commerce. With a 30-hour work week predicted, Gillis said this area should be a good one for development of recreation facilities.In April, Suffolk City and Nansemond County began a program to connect many organizations and planning committees. Included in this was the combined Christmas charity of the Salvation Army. This program would set in motion the combining of Suffolk and Nansemond County.In June, astronauts entered lunar gravity and orbited the moon. Apollo 10’s climactic moment came when the astronauts triggered Apollo 10’s engine to steer the craft into an orbit 69 miles above the cratered surface. The firing, behind the moon and out of range of ground stations, started a perilous 2 1/2-day lunar adventure intended to clear the way for two Apollo 11 astronauts to land on the moon in July.On July 20, a “giant leap for mankind” took place. Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. left their footprints in the lunar dust and in the history of man. Through the magic of television, an estimated 500 million people around the world had a ringside seat to man’s greatest adventure.The picture was black and white and somewhat jerky, but it recorded history. As Armstrong planted his size 9 1/2 left boot on the powdery surface at 10:56 p.m. Sunday, he spoke words that will be remembered for all time: “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.’’There were other memorable utterances during the day of high adventure. There were Armstong’s words when Eagle separated from the command ship to start the dangerous descent: “The Eagle is flying.” There were Armstrong’s — and man’s — first words from the moon’s surface after touchdown at 4:18 p.m.: “Houston . . . Tranquility base here. The Eagle has landed.” Or when Aldrin, a deeply religious man, relayed this message to the world shortly after the landing: “This is the LM pilot. I’d like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening, whoever, wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.’’They planted an American flag and saluted it, but made it plain they came to the moon as ambassadors for all mankind. They unveiled a stainless steel plaque bearing these words: “Here men from Planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969, A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.” They left a disc on the moon with recorded messages from the leaders of 76 nations. They left behind mementos for three Americans and two Russians who died for the cause of space exploration.On Nov. 19, the second moon walk took place. The first color video from the moon’s surface showed Alan Bean and Pete Conrad as ghostly white figures shuffling through an alien world.Both reported initial difficulty in walking. “I’ve got to take it easy and watch what I’m doing,” Conrad reported. “You get on a little slope and you tend to keep going.” “If you don’t pick up your feet you really kick a load of dirt ahead of you,” Bean commented. Noting the powdery black dust, Conrad said, “I tell you one thing, we’re going to be a couple dirty boogers.” Later, Conrad said, “It helps you move if you hop a little. I’m beginning to feel like Bugs Bunny.”The second moon landing was a bull’s-eye landing. Within minutes after stepping on the surface, Conrad strolled to the edge of the crater and sighted the unmanned Surveyor spacecraft that soft-landed there 2 1/2 years prior. Surveyor had been their landing target, and they had zeroed in on it during their approach.The moon landings provided a climactic end to a decade filled with turmoil and advancements.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_94,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Amid a shock this past weekend that was as monumental for Israel as was Sept. 11, 2001, for the U.S. a generation ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set out a good framework to respond. Whether he can stick to that strategy and execute it, rather than repeat the mistakes the U.S. made in the years after al-Qaeda’s equally unexpected attack on New York, will decide his place in Israel’s history.Netanyahu said his country was now at “war’’ with Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. Though understandable, or even inevitable, given the moment, this wasn’t a good sign. Wars demand clear battlefield victories that don’t necessarily bring strategic ones, and Israel’s strategic priority right now should be containment. This conflict could grow a lot worse if allowed.The more substantive part of Netanyahu’s statement on Saturday was hard to fault. He divided his prescription for the days and weeks ahead into three parts: First, clear Hamas fighters from Israeli territory and restore security to the border; second, exact a price from Hamas, including in Gaza, while securing other borders to ensure nobody else attacks; and finally, unite and remain level-headed. It’s the second and third parts that will be hard to stick to, so let’s take them one at a time.Netanyahu’s second point is critical. It balances the need for retribution, and to weaken Hamas’s capacity for any repeat, with the need to make sure that this brutal raid on Israeli territory doesn’t become a real war, fought by Israel on one side against a range of state and non-state actors on the other. This is likely to be Hamas’s intent.Despite all the 1973 parallels, this isn’t the Yom Kippur war — yet. Israel has been attacked by just one of its regional adversaries, and one of the weakest at that. Some of the country’s battlefield opponents from the 1970s have even reconciled with it since. Still, all this can change quickly if the conflict escalates with the fury of the moment.As with the U.S. and Afghanistan after Sept. 11, Netanyahu has little choice but to send his armed forces into Gaza, not least to retrieve hostages. But the nature and extent of that assault aren’t predetermined. Gaza is a densely populated urban territory of about 2 million people, and achieving full control will likely require the most vicious, difficult form of warfare.The Israel Defense Forces are equipped to do that, but it isn’t clear what an achievable endgame would be, and that needs to be determined in advance. Failure to do so cost the U.S. and ordinary Afghans dearly. Iraq was a still-worse example.A full-blown invasion aimed at wiping Hamas and its supporters from the map would increase the risk that other regional players become involved, seeing an opportunity as Israeli forces become bogged down in Gaza. Public support for action in Arab states also would likely grow, in tandem with online images of civilian Palestinian casualties.Some, including Republican U.S. senators, have concluded already that Iran organized Saturday’s attack, enabled by $6 billion in fresh funding approved by the Biden administration as part of a prisoner exchange deal.It’s an understandable question. Iran does finance and support Hamas, and on Monday President Ebrahim Raisi congratulated the group on an attack that has already claimed more than 1,000 lives, many of them civilians. The U.S. says there is no hard evidence of Tehran’s substantive involvement. A Wall Street Journal report says there was Iranian coordination, citing sources in Hamas and Hezbollah.Regarding the $6 billion. That money — which consists of previously frozen Iranian cash — is, as far as anyone can be sure, still tied up in Qatari banks. Given that the funds arrived in Qatar only after a Sept. 27 agreement, they couldn’t have paid for the months-long preparations needed for Hamas’s multi-pronged attack.It’s also reasonable to expect that if this plan had originated with Iran, it would have involved a second front opened by Hezbollah from Lebanon. So far, Hezbollah has only fired a few warning shots into the tiny, disputed Shebaa farms strip, which were met with a similarly symbolic response from the Israelis. A larger Hezbollah intervention could yet come.Others have accused Russia, which could well benefit from the distraction from its war in Ukraine. But again, there is no evidence to support this. Perhaps it will come, too, but Hamas had plenty of reasons of its own to act when it did. Confirmation of an Iranian role in particular needs to be rock solid, because that could trigger a much wider regional war with unpredictable consequences.And if Iran did plan the attack, a wider war will have been part of its planning, if not its goal.Which brings us to Netanyahu’s third agenda items: unity and level headedness.There is no justifying what Hamas has done, yet there will also be no repairing the puncture its attack has inflicted on Israeli confidence in the invincibility of its defenses. That needs to feed into a reassessment of whether the Netanyahu government’s uncompromising approach on every Palestinian red line — from access to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, to the status of Jerusalem or settlement policies in the West Bank — is sustainable. Saturday’s mayhem suggests strongly that it is not.One reason Hamas had so much success in achieving operational surprise against Israel’s storied intelligence service, as well as in storming the border, appears to have been that so many security services resources had been diverted north to the West Bank, to deal with Palestinian protests over the actions of Netanyahu’s government and its supporters. Israeli protests over his attempts to weaken the independence of nation’s judiciary created further distraction.That record isn’t encouraging when it comes to achieving either unity or a level head. The political pressure on Netanyahu to exact maximum possible revenge rather than act strategically, especially from the right wing of his coalition government, will be overwhelming.So, it’s a good sign he said he’d consider forming a new cross-party government to deal with the emergency. As opposition leader Yair Lapid put it, the coming fight “won’t be easy and it won’t be short. It has strategic consequences, which we haven’t seen for many years. There is a serious risk that it will become a multi-front war.” Less promising was Netanyahu’s address on Sunday, in which he pledged victory in a war that would turn every hiding place in the “evil city” of Gaza to rubble. He needs to stay the course and follow his own advice on how to respond to Hamas’s attack, for the sake of Israelis, the vast majority of Palestinians who aren’t combatants and his own legacy.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2023_211,"Published 4:25 pm Tuesday, August 29, 2023ByJen JaquaThe 1983 primary election had a low voter turnout, but nowhere was that more apparent than in one Suffolk precinct. The Airport Precinct, one of three “split” precincts in Suffolk for that election, had only 71 eligible voters for this primary. Only eight of the voters actually went to the polls. The cost of operating that polling location turned out to be about $25 a vote.In the fall of ’83, Planters Park, a 5.5-acre recreational area, was given to the city. Nabisco Brands Inc., which was the owner of Planters Peanuts at the time, donated the facility, “recognizing the community’s continued need for Planters Park.”Construction was active in May ‘84. Two bridge projects in Suffolk were among the construction, repair and resurfacing projects being carried out by the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation. One project was the construction of a two-lane bridge over the Norfolk and Western Railway and Seaboard Coast Line railroad tracks on Pinner Street. Also set for completion in the fall were the repairs to the bridge on Route 125 over the Nansemond River in Chuckatuck.According to a story in the Oct. 31, 1984, edition of the paper, Suffolk is home to several ghosts. “In the days of the great iron horse, when Suffolk was a major railroad center for the East Coast of the United States, there was a tragedy one dark and foggy night. One of the mighty trains roared along. Just before a crossing on Jackson Road, there was a huge tree across the tracks, fallen during a storm the night before. Unfortunately, the engineer failed to see the ancient oak, and the mighty engine wrecked.Train cars piled atop the engine, and coal spilled out across the farmland. In the tragedy a brakeman, just stepping across from one car to the other, was crushed between them. The story says he was decapitated in the dreadful wreck. Several others lost their lives that night.But the brakeman…the brakeman never left Jackson Road. His spirit still walks along the railroad track, searching for his head. And on dark and foggy nights when the moon drifts beneath thick clouds, you can see his light on the railroad tracks. Eyewitnesses report the light is greenish-blue and as you stand and watch, it comes closer and closer until the dread is so awful, so horrible, you’re compelled to run. Suffolk residents who have seen the light will assure you it’s there. Some brave souls try to say it’s phosphor or swamp gas, but those who have seen the light, those who believe in ghosts and spirits, know it’s the brakeman searching for his head.A strange noise radiates from Bright’s Pond on cloudy nights, when the stars aren’t shining and darkness falls thick across the water. It sounds as though someone is wailing, maybe calling to a lost love. The noise has often been attributed to the wind, but the wail continues on dark nights even when there is no wind.Even the Suffolk News-Herald’s former building on South Saratoga Street was reported to have a ghost. “The resident ghost changes radio stations when the music doesn’t appeal to him and often opens doors rather than walking through walls. The spirit, say those who know, is that of a circulation manager who died in an upstairs room. Footsteps are heard in the halls late at night when there’s no one in the halls. A certain footstool moves slowly across the floor without assistance from human hands. ‘I was here very late one night,’ says one who has encountered the spirit. ‘I heard footsteps running in the hallway. When I walked out to investigate, staples flew from the wall and telephone wires fell from their mounting.’ This resident ghost of the newspaper remains mostly in the upstairs room where, several years ago, he sat down, put his head in his hand, and passed on to another world. But on a night like tonight, he may even venture onto the streets of Suffolk.”Jen Jaquais the creative director for the Suffolk News-Herald.

The Commission on Water Resource Management, on the other hand, has implemented a phantom water management area designation for the area north of Palani Road that has put a hold on new housing there also.As a result, new developments proposed for this area by Stanford Carr and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands remain in limbo because the water commission has decided not to allow the drilling of new water wells into the aquifer.This issue was supposedly addressed back in 2015, when the commission tried to implement a water management area for West Hawaii at the National Park Service’s request. The NPS asserted the drilling of water wells into the aquifer above the Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park has an adverse effect on park resources.The perfect storm of these water and archaeological issues has made it difficult to develop new housing in Kailua-Kona. This has resulted in more people moving out of state, or to areas like Ocean View and Puna in search of affordable housing.I strongly believe we need to ease up on these barriers or the current status quo will continue.Aaron SteneKailua-KonaHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2023_138,"Published 6:23 pm Friday, February 3, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardFor anyone who has ever spent a few hours in the Great Dismal Swamp, it’s hard to imagine making a life there. But for escaped slaves during the 19th century, the alternatives could be far worse.That’s part of what made the swamp an important stop along the Underground Railroad, the route taken by slaves who had escaped their awful lives of inhumane treatment and oppression throughout the South and who were headed to freedom in the North before and during the American Civil War.Perhaps the most inspiring of Suffolk’s numerous observations of Black History Month is the Great Dismal Swamp Underground Railroad Pavilion Tour, set for 10 a.m. Saturday, Feb. 18. Tickets are just $7 for adults and $5 for seniors 60 and older, military veterans and children ages 8-12. The tour is not recommended for children younger than 8.Conditions in the swamp were surely brutal, but the maroons, as they were known upon their escape, were free there and could take steps toward new lives in the vast wilderness that existed in what is now Suffolk, Chesapeake and Northeast North Carolina.Through the years, many thousands of runaway slaves found refuge in that wilderness, aided in their quest for freedom by others who had gone before them and by abolitionists who believed that all men and women deserved to live free. Some stopped in the swamp on their journey north. Others made a home there.Teams of archeologists have found everything from the imprints of cabins to tools left behind by American Indians and repurposed by the maroons. The evidence led not only to confirmation of the legends about the maroons but also to the ability of the swamp to be listed as part of the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.After years of hard work to verify the legends, a pavilion was built a decade ago just inside the swamp’s entrance off Desert Road to commemorate the brave men and women who ventured into that inhospitable place in search of freedom and a new home.Participants in the Feb. 18 tour will learn more about their story and surely be moved by the experience. Bus transportation to the swamp is available at 9:30 a.m. from the Suffolk Visitor Center, 524 N. Main St. The walking tour includes uneven and elevated surfaces, so comfortable shoes and weather-appropriate dress are recommended.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

The jury is still out on that one. It is possible the plan constructed by Hamas was so bold and detailed that it was dismissed as being too complex for Hamas to carry out.One can only hope if Israel succeeds in destroying Hamas, the end result would be Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank deciding terrorism is not the answer.Then, maybe a two state solution will become a reality.Don BakerVolcanoConcerns aboutmosquitoes planOn Nov. 22, a court case was filed in Kauai against the state Department of Land and Natural Resources and their board, who voted to release Wolbachia bacteria-injected mosquitoes without a full environmental impact statement.Their stated goal is birth control for mosquitoes that carry avian malaria. They claim this will save native birds. However, per their own assessment, they don’t know if this experiment, which has never been done at this level anywhere in the world, will work.When asked how they are going to test to see if this experiment is saving native birds, their reply was that that was not part of their experimental protocol.What?!Studies have shown that Wolbachia bacteria can cause mosquitoes to become more capable of transmitting avian malaria and West Nile virus. The mosquitoes being brought in transmit other human diseases, including elephantiasis and encephalitis!A Freedom of Information Act request was sent to the EPA requesting how they are going to screen the mosquitoes for pathogens before they’re brought into Hawaii, and they are withholding that information.The BLNR has approved experiment, and their DLNR has a lab that will create these mosquitoes and release them forever in the islands. Isn’t that a conflict of interest?They claim a small, insignificant number of injected females will be released. One injected female can lay up to 300 eggs in her lifetime. That’s hundreds of females compatible with injected males. How will this experiment be stopped if they are breeding in the wild?With the strictness of animals and plants coming into Hawaii, why isn’t there the same rigidity for an insect that could change the entire ecosystem?HawaiiUnites.org has a court case on Maui that is expected to continue early next year, and thank God for the two men who filed a case in Kauai.Michelle MelendezHiloNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
suffolknewsherald_2023_246,"Published 4:42 pm Tuesday, July 11, 2023ByStaff ReportsPart two in a series of threeSister Mary Wilhelmina Lancaster was born Mary Elizabeth Lancaster on Palm Sunday, April 13, 1924. At age nine, she had a vision of Jesus who wanted her to be his. She was “in love with our Lord.” She graduated valedictorian in a Catholic school established by her parents.At 13, she had wanted to enter a convent and joined the Oblate Sisters of Providence. She began her formation as a sister in 1941. She took the name “Wilhelmina” when she took her vows, in honor of her pastor, Fr. William Markoe, Society of Jesus, who encouraged her to pursue her vocation.As a nun of the Oblates of Providence, she dedicated most of her life teaching inner city youth and advocating civil rights in different Catholic schools in different archdioceses of Baltimore, Washington, Charleston, St. Louis, Philadelphia and Miami.After 50 years with the Oblate Sisters of Providence, she left her community to found a new order, in 1995, the Benedictine Sisters of Mary, Queen of the Apostles. Her new community moved to the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph in 2006. Four years later, her order moved to Gower, Missouri. Sr. Wilhelmina, Oblate Sisters of St. Benedict, became the first “Prioress” or superior.When she died May 29, 2019 at age 95, her body was not embalmed. In a simple wooden coffin, she was buried two days later in the monastery’s graveyard.On Aug. 15, 2020, a biographical book, “God’s Will: The Life and Works of Sr. Mary Wilhelmina, Foundress of the Benedictines of Mary, Queen of the Apostles,” was published by her order. As the book’s title suggests, it features the life story of Sr. Mary Wilhemina and her love for poetry.In one of her poems in the book, you read: “Home is where you drink and sleep and eat; Home is where you pray and God’s orders keep; Where you live united in love! Where you look to Heaven high above!”In another poem she wrote, “Honor St. Joseph’s Fidelity to grace! That you may come to see at last God’s face…Honor St. Joseph’s Love for Mary! That to God’s Will you never be contrary. Honor St. Joseph’s Love for the Holy Child! That you pass through life Pure and undefiled!”On April 28, the Benedictine Sisters of Mary, Queen of the Apostles, decided to exhume the body of their foundress, Sister Wilhelmina, to transfer it to a new shrine altar honoring St. Joseph, the patron saint of the universal church. Four years after her death, they found that her exhumed remains were intact. In short, this nun’s miraculous body was incorrupt. That is, it didn’t rot or decompose, as if she’s only sleeping!.The Diocese of Kansas City, St. Joseph, Missouri has issued a statement on May 22, saying that Sister Wilhelmina’s remains “has understandably generated widespread interest and raised important questions.”-Chris A.

suffolknewsherald_2023_51,"Published 4:36 pm Tuesday, May 9, 2023ByStaff ReportsAs much as we love the idea of Virginia being powered completely by clean energy, and believe it will one day happen, we understand that the electrical grid just isn’t there yet. So does Dominion Energy Virginia.The state’s largest utility made that clear with its most recent integrated resource plan (IRP , which proposes how it will meet ratepayers’ electricity needs for the next quarter-century. There are significant changes from Dominion’s IRP just one year earlier.Highlights of the May 1 filing include 2,900 megawatts of new natural glass plans and 1,600 megawatts of small modular nuclear reactors — a warning that the Virginia Clean Economy Act, passed three years ago with a mandate of carbon-emissions-free electricity by 2045, is out of touch with reality.Dominion’s plan also aligns with Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s energy plan, which calls for expansion of both nuclear and natural gas to ensure the electrical grid’s reliability and affordable electricity for Virginians while admirable and needed work continues toward 100% renewable energy.Steve Haner of the Alexandria-based Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy opined this week on Dominion’s filing and what it means for ratepayers and policymakers:“Adding the new SMR nuclear capacity and natural gas capacity allows Dominion to propose either building or buying substantially less solar capacity. The preferred 2022 plan projected adding almost 26 gigawatts of solar but this new plan trims that to below 20 GW. Both the 2022 and 2023 plans include the second phase of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, another 2.6 gigawatts, coming online in the early 2030. But the 2023 plan, for the first time, also includes more than 600 megawatts of onshore wind turbines.“As before, Dominion offered five alternatives in all, one intended to be ‘least cost’ and showing no concern for reducing CO2 emissions, and then two that achieve a claimed zero emissions by the VCEA target date of 2045. Interestingly, the zero carbon alternatives rely on even more nuclear power to balance demand with supply. The least-cost plan adds no nuclear but far more natural gas generation. What are Virginians willing to pay for miniscule, too-tiny-to-matter reductions in worldwide CO2 levels?“Last year Dominion projected a residential bill on 1,000 kilowatt hours per month would reach $177 by 2035, and now it has lowered that to $174. (The actual bill was under $117 three years ago. The earlier estimate using the State Corporation Commission’s method was $213 and now it projects that bill reaching $235 by 2035. Yes, the SCC methodology has bills doubling between 2020 and 2035.”Work on a carbonless energy supply must continue with urgency, but impractical mandates like the Virginia Clean Economy Act mustn’t be allowed to wreck the economy and consumers’ pocketbooks in the meantime.Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

philinquirer_2023_13,"When a group of Philadelphia-area rabbis visited Tel Aviv recently, they heard plenty of horror stories. But they also experienced the inspiring unity of Israelis, both Jewish and Muslim. TEL AVIV, Israel — The moment one arrives at Ben Gurion Airport, the burden of the nation after the atrocities of Oct. 7 comes into sharp focus. Along the ramp to passport control, there are glass panels overlooking the tarmac. These days there are nothing but planes from El Al — Israel’s national carrier; all other airlines have stopped serving Tel Aviv. Sitting on a ledge at the base of the windows are placards bearing the faces of those kidnapped during the attacks — faces that I would later see on T-shirts, on posters, on billboards, and projected onto the walls of buildings. The seemingly ever-present portraits of so many smiling faces around Tel Aviv delivered an eerie, silent, and familiar message — “Let my people go!” As on the tarmac, Israelis bear the burden to bring its people home. Two weeks ago, a small group of local rabbis went on an emergency solidarity mission to Israel led by the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia. During our 56 hours on the ground, we found a nation in mourning for the 1,200 souls who were murdered by Hamas, but also a nation that was also working hard to heal itself. We heard from family members of the kidnapped and shared their anguish in not knowing the fates of their loved ones, we visited aid centers where volunteers worked to provide everything from mental health counseling to food and supplies to those who survived the terror, and we were given a rare briefing by an elite Israeli Defense Forces team that is still sorting through evidence and other forensic data from Oct. 7. The team,Unit 504 — the soldiers responsible for interrogating terrorists —told us about theHamas kidnapping manuals, which they said included explicit instructions to commit atrocities with sadistic savagery. The manuals made clear that their authors, Hamas’ leadership, many of whom arecomfortably ensconced in foreign countries, sought totrigger Holocaust traumaand provoke the Israeli government into a response that would catalyze world opinion against Israel and inflame the Arab street. Similar motives account for Hamas positioning theirmilitary operations in and under hospitalsto ensure either a military victory, if not attacked, or a public relations coup if they are. Hamas’ ideology is one of Islamic supremacy: Only faithful Muslims can rule in dar-al-Islam, the abode of Islam — the lands where Muslim sovereignty once prevailed. Fortunately, their fundamentalist mentality is not shared by all in the region. » READ MORE:A week in a warzone | Opinion When Arab states have acquiesced to Israel’s existence, Israel has made peace or normalized relations with them: Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. Hamas’ recent brutality was prompted by the news that Saudi Arabia was poised to normalize relations with Israel. Hamas couldn’t tolerate that because Hamas can’t tolerate the existence of a Jewish state in what was once the abode of Islam. The sin of Islamic supremacy is, in theory, no worse than the sin of Jewish supremacy, which exists amongsome political parties in Israel’s governing coalition— and the sin of white Christian supremacy, which exists in some quarters of America’s politics, especially the extreme wing of the Republican Party. They’re equally pernicious, although not equally bloodthirsty. Our solidarity mission heard plenty of horror stories, but we also experienced the inspiring unity of Israelis, both Jewish and Muslim. In addition to providing mental health care,a resiliency centerin the southern city of Netivot had begun collecting and distributing food, medicine, clothes, and hygiene products thanks to dozens of volunteers. Roughly 360,000 Israelis have been called to reserve duty, leaving many parents alone with their children. Another quarter million Israelis have been evacuated from their homes. Volunteers, from Israel and abroad, are opening schools in evacuation centers, providing after-school activities, harvesting neglected fields, and cooking and delivering food. Foreign firefighters have volunteered to cover two-week-long shifts so their Israeli counterparts can join their military reserve units on the battlefield. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment, and so many people are stepping up. The seemingly ever-present portraits of so many smiling faces around Tel Aviv delivered an eerie, silent, and familiar message — “Let my people go!” The hope expressed by Israeli Jews and Israeli Muslims reminds me of the words of our collective prophet — whether he be called Moses, Moshe, or Musa — who issued a challenge to us that echoes through the generations. “I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse,”the prophet said. “Choose life — if you and your descendants would live long upon the land that God swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” The children of Abraham — Jews, Christians, and Muslims — must choose life and abandon ideologies that deny the divine image of the other. That image should serve as a reminder to us all of every true religion’s unifying message — that the lives of each and every member of the human family is equally precious.

leoweekly_2023_30,"LEO is dedicated to bringing you engaging, fun, and unique content that crosses many spectrums. From our sister paper in Tampa, Creative Loafing, we’re happy to share the Oracle of Ybor, written by Caroline DeBruhl. Here you may submit your questions about life, and the tarot will help to guide your answers.Dear Oracle,As an arts major, my career has always been an adventure, but I found a full-time role up north that I mostly enjoyed before we moved to Pinellas County two years ago. I found a related job in Tampa but quickly realized it wasn’t a good fit for me. Now I’m commuting 6+ hours a week to a difficult, stressful, unfulfilling job while struggling to meet people where I live. I’ve applied to positions with no luck, hired a career coach who sent me jobs located even further away, and considered going back to school. This job is sucking the soul out of my body, but I don’t know if I can take a $15k pay cut to work closer to home. Do the cards have any wisdom for me?Thank you for your help,New Floridian from the Great White NorthCards: The Chariot, Eight of Swords (rev. , Six of Pentacles (rev. , The Hierophant (rev. Dear New Floridian,So I’m going to start off this reading with some pagan theology but stick with me because I promise I have a point.In the religion of Wicca, there is a central tenet known as the Wiccan Rede: “An’ harm none, do as ye will.” Like most quotes of religious texts, people of the faith have argued about its meaning (and exact phrasing since Doreen Valiente first spoke it in 1964.Some argue that it means that as long as you don’t harm anyone, you can do whatever you want. Others argue that this phrase comes from the older tradition of Thelma: “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” In Thelma, “thou wilt” doesn’t mean “do whatever you want.” It’s supposed to be following your True Will or the grand destiny of your life.The argument for this interpretation is that you should follow your destiny as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone else. But here’s the catch: to deny yourself your True nature or your True calling is to harm yourself. That breaks the first part of the rule.I bring all of this up because of the very first card of the spread: The Chariot. It is a major arcana card and the only one right side up, meaning it’s the most crucial energy you’re facing.The Chariot is a powerful card of momentum. It’s a card that can plow through barriers and propel your forward at a breakneck speed. The Charioteer stands their ground; they are in absolute control. But this type of energy is a double edge sword. You have to really know yourself to be in control of The Chariot. Because while it can obliterate barriers and plow through challenges, it can also send you off in the wrong direction at 100 mph.It is most defiantly a “shoot first, ask questions later” sort of card, and right now, I think you need to ask the question: what is my True Will?What is it that you really, in your soul, know you want and need to do for your career? Be completely honest with yourself, even if that answer feels unrealistic or silly, or impossible. That answer is going to be how you navigate this Chariot.Your current job sucks, and you should absolutely quit it as soon as you can financially swing it. But you want to make sure that you don’t go galloping off into another dead-end job. You need to be intentional about the next steps.I know you’ve been applying to jobs without hearing anything back and have hired a career coach who has been less than helpful. You’re feeling stuck; we can see that with the Eight of Swords reversed. But, as I’ve written about before, the Eight of Swords is deceitful; there is a way out if you can find it.You might need to get creative and look at different strategies. A slight pivot into an adjacent field may actually provide a more satisfying career path. But again, be honest with yourself about what you’re looking for and what you need. As an arts major, do you need a flexible day job that allows you more time to create? Do you need to be in the field to feel connected and inspired?You brought up possibly going back to school, and with The Hierophant, I think that’s a solid option to consider. Getting an advanced degree in your field could help with job prospects, but it could also help you explore your interests and find that True calling, and then help you hone the skills you need.But there are financial worries right now that need to be considered. The Six of Pentacles is a tricky card because it’s both about giving as well as receiving. It might mean you need to find a job that is more giving---or it might mean you need to take out loans to pay for grad school.Take a holistic look at all of the finances of your household: pull out all bills, all debts, all information about savings and income, and bonuses and assets. What is the base amount you need every month? What makes you feel comfortable savings-wise? Having a clear picture of your finances will help you see if you can take a significant pay cut for a job or not and what you would need finically to go back to school (if you choose. Would others in the household be able/willing to cover changes in financial circumstances? This is also a great place for honest conversation.The good news is, whatever happens, you’ll get out of this soul-crushing job. You are The Chariot, goddammit, a mighty and fierce thing to behold. You have the power to plow through barriers while still being rooted with the reins in hand. It might be a bumpy road, but with your True Will to guide you, you’ll be on the path you’re meant to take.Subscribe to LEO Daily newsletters.|NewsBreak (coming soon ||||| ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_57,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°With great anxiety about the future of America, we will watch three justices decide whether the man who gave them lifetime appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court is still eligible to be elected president despite organizing, fomenting and then executing a violent uprising against Congress.Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh hold the future of our storied democracy in their hands as they consider a robust 213-page ruling from the Colorado Supreme Court that found former President Donald Trump engaged in insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. Because of their appointment by Trump, these three justices are uniquely positioned to enforce the Constitution and avoid a crisis that could unravel the foundations of America’s republic.The case Anderson vs. Griswold is clear; Trump’s actions have disqualified him from holding the office of president.Four members of Colorado’s Supreme Court spelled out exactly how and why Trump cannot appear on Colorado’s primary ballot in 2024 in a ruling that slams the door on many of the exit ramps the U.S. Supreme Court could take to avoid actually considering the consequences of Trump’s actions.Insurrection has a common, widely-understood definition, according to the ruling, the dictionary and legal precedent, of “a public use of force or threat of force by a group of people to hinder or prevent execution of the Constitution of the United States.”As he desperately clung to power from the White House despite having lost a free and fair election on Nov. 3, 2020, Trump worked for weeks to foment unrest among his supporters based on an elaborate election fraud lie. He then organized a rally near the U.S. Capitol on the very day Congress was set to seat President Joe Biden by counting the Electoral College ballots in a joint session of the House and Senate.Trump worked behind the scenes to pressure members of Congress and the vice president to only count the ballots from states that would ensure his victory, but he also urged the crowd at his rally to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell.” The crowd did just that, breaking through security barriers, assaulting Capitol police, entering the U.S. Capitol and forcing Congress to shut down its official proceedings as the mob entered the chambers where members had been about to finish their vote to officially make Biden president.The language of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution could not be clearer. Anyone who “engages in an insurrection” while holding public office, is disqualified from holding office in the future. The amendment’s precise language does not require there to be a criminal conviction of insurrection – the equivalent of which would be charges of treason, sedition or subversive activities. Rather the amendment merely requires a determination that someone engaged in insurrection.The amendment became part of our Constitution following the insurrection and rebellion of political leaders in the South that eventually led to the Civil War. Confederate President Jefferson Davis was never tried for a crime following the Civil War, but the 14th Amendment’s plain language makes it clear the people and Congress never wanted Davis, a former senator and congress member, and those who had followed him to war despite having sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution, holding federal office again. Unless, as spelled out in Section 3, Congress overwhelmingly voted to forgive someone of their insurrection or rebellion. Another critical point is that the Amendment doesn’t say unless someone is acquitted in a court of law. The intent is clear that this determination is separate from criminal proceedings.The reality is that following the Civil War, very few people faced criminal prosecution for their actions. The decision not to prosecute was a concerted effort to reunite America following the war. Davis was the only Confederate leader who remained stripped of his citizenship following the war.Some hold now, that the U.S. Supreme Court, if asked on appeal, should take a similar conciliatory approach to keeping Trump on the ballot. If Trump is denied another bid for the presidency his supporters have already proven themselves capable of violence in the former president’s name. Shouldn’t we allow democracy to run its course and trust that the American people will not put a man in office who already once attempted to undermine our republic?No. Trump has already once convinced millions of people that the 2020 election was fraudulent and then inspired thousands of his followers to attack the U.S. Capitol. When Trump loses the 2024 election, it will be no different. His lies will again permeate among his followers inspiring extremism and violence. Worse, he could win and then, wielding the power of the White House, become the threat from within that the drafters of the 14th Amendment were trying to prevent when they wrote Section 3. Congress agreed that the threat was real by passing the Civil Rights Amendment in 1866 and it became part of the Constitution in 1868 when 28 states ratified the amendment.The U.S. Supreme Court, if asked on appeal, must protect our republic. The court is charged with upholding and enforcing the Constitution, including Section 3 of Amendment 14. And in doing just that the court will defend our democratic process by which elections determine who leads this country. Trump is not only unqualified to hold office according to the Constitution, but his actions have proven he is a real threat to the United States of America.Gorsuch, Barrett and Kavanaugh – given their unique positions as those appointed by Trump — can save America by uniting behind Colorado’s Supreme Court ruling.— The Denver PostNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
eugeneweekly_2023_36,"We ve got issues. Eugene Weekly’s June 15 cover story “Where’s the Humanity?” described how sad and ultimately unjust Eugene’s policies are towards the homeless. Here we are, living in one of the most liberal cities in the country, and yet — when the rubber meets the road, we find a city that ultimately creates a non-humane environment for those of us that have the least. As liberals, we are living a lie. Why is this? I know that the city of Eugene is filled with honest and good people who try to do the best job they possibly can. A good part of the problem is the city charter, which is designed to neuter elected officials for the sake of management efficiency. Having elected officials with more accountability for daily operations of city government would be nice, but that’s not going to happen in the near future. For government structure, we have to play with the cards that have been dealt to us. So instead, I’d like to appeal to our collective better angels. The city government needs to rethink its positions, because its current regulations on camping are pretty much a joke. Are we going to supply every homeless person with a tape measure? Why are homeless camps prohibited 1,000 feet from a school? Are they that big a threat to young, impressionable high school seniors? All of this was done, supposedly, to legally comply with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decisionMartin v. Boise. I contend that the recent policy changes have substantially made Eugene less legally safe, and more vulnerable to legal challenges. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Homeless case law today is very similar to the state of civil rights legislation in the late 1940s. A future Supreme Court case on the magnitude ofBrown v. Board of Educationwould no doubt set off legal requirements that will be more expensive to implement in the future. A locally based lawsuit could easily develop as well with the same results, and the byzantine nature of new city standards has made matters worse. For example, showing a city map where camping is allowed was not done. I made a joke about the map requirement. The city of Eugene did submit a map. It was of the city of Springfield! Eugene needs to be motivated to rethink its positions again — simply because it’s in the city’s self interest to do so as quickly as possible. And a good deal of “legal fireproofing” is not costly, and it’s easy to implement. First, a city ballot measure should be put together to authorize $100 million for low income and moderate income housing. While I would support this enthusiastically — even if the measure failed — such an action would demonstrate that the city was making a large-scale good faith effort to tackle the problem head on. Another easy approach would be the establishment of daily fee campgrounds. At least two 30-unit facilities should be available both for campers and vehicles, complete with rules and facilities for short-term living. And fees could be set to cover all infrastructure and operating costs on a break-even plus basis. Other steps that can be taken include obtaining federal or state money for converting empty commercial space into low income housing, SROs (single room occupancies , or other housing modalities that are not currently available. Increased lobbying in Salem and Washington, D.C., is necessary for obtaining a more robust mix of mental health and drug/alcohol treatment. Nationally, Oregon is ranked 49th for mental health, and 47th for drug/alcohol services. Eugene is in dangerous waters. The car is going down the road, and the warning light is on. Clearly, the mechanic’s diktat operates here: You can pay me now, or you can pay me later."
suffolknewsherald_2023_114,"Published 5:14 pm Friday, February 24, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardMuch has been said about election integrity in our nation’s political discourse in recent years, and reasonable people can disagree about the depth of the problem.But when fraud is obvious, the system must work quickly and efficiently to expose and punish perpetrators. Such assertive action will earn the confidence of the electorate and discourage future attempts to undermine election integrity.So we were pleased to learn that a Suffolk Circuit Court grand jury has indicted a campaign worker for former City Council candidate Art Bredemeyer.Dana Marie Cooper faces 17 felony counts of election fraud after allegedly gathering fraudulent signatures for Bredemeyer’s qualifying petition.City Registrar Burdette Lawrence initially certified Bredemeyer as a candidate for the Suffolk Borough council election after a petition with 222 signatures was submitted. A council candidate needs 125 valid signatures to be put on the ballot. But Lawrence’s office soon was flooded with complaints from citizens who said their alleged signatures appeared on a document they never signed. After initially saying Bredemeyer could stay on the ballot, the three-member Suffolk Electoral Board reversed course and kicked him out of the race.While Cooper is innocent until proven guilty, the evidence appears to be damning. She faces the possibility of prison time and fines if convicted: imprisonment of a year to 10 years per count, a fine of up to $2,500 per count, either or both.We believe that honest, fair elections at the local level head off problems, real or perceived, at the state and national levels. After all, every vote, whether in Virginia or Vermont, is cast in a local precinct and tabulated by local people. A conspiracy to alter the outcome of a statewide or national race would require so many participants as to be impossible to pull off, in our view.Local election officials here and elsewhere are democracy’s unsung heroes and worthy of commendation rather than scorn. In this case, they got it right by removing Bredemeyer from the ballot and asking the commonwealth’s attorney to investigate the apparent fraud.Bredemeyer has said he was unaware of the fraudulent signatures and blamed it squarely on Cooper, a consultant for his campaign. Nonetheless, his petition didn’t follow the rules, and his remaining on the ballot would have left a permanent cloud over his City Council service had he been elected in November.Suffolk voters should take comfort in knowing that local elections are in good hands.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2023_67,"I can’t believe that we still have to write the same stories and relive the same ignorant history that follows people of color and those in the LGBT+ community. I’ve been following the news as red state legislators double down on bullying instead of working to help Americans eat and provide for their families. Instead of building pathways for people, these wacky motherfuckers are in full slash-and-burn mode on Americans who are not white, religious, or heteronormative, all the while, throwing stones and living in giant glass houses.I’m convinced, even more, after reading arecent article about Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, that the entire GOP is a collection of cracked lunatics who hide under cloaks of righteousness to do the work of the demons they want to cast out of everyone else. Lee, who, himself, donned women’s clothing while in high school is agreeing to sign a partial ban on drag passed by Tennessee legislators. The Tennessee Holler called out his hypocrisy on .? WATCH: “Do you remember dressing in drag in 1977? Is it only illegal when gay people do it?”@GovBillLeedidn’t appreciate that we printed out the FRANKLIN HIGH YEARBOOK PHOTO — but did not deny it’s him. Meanwhile he’s about to make drag a felony by signing an absurd law.?pic..com/C7YQcQyis3The proposed Tennessee law is like many versions of the Republican agenda across this country where Republican majority states want to ban drag in public, in front of children, and within so many feet of a school or church. KY’s ownSB 115would label venues that host drag shows, story hours, or brunches as adult-oriented businesses. Further, it equates drag with stripping and nude performances. As the bill mandates adult-oriented businesses be located at least 1,000 feet from the nearest residence, school, walking trail, and a number of other places, it would essentially end drag as it exists today in Louisville.Nevertheless, Republicans haven’t stopped attacking things that adults do and innocent drag performances that have absolutely nothing to do with sex. If drag is sexual, then perhaps it would do Republicans well to read the works of William Shakespeare. In particular, if they spent a little time reading “Merchant of Venice,” they might understand that the use of drag was, in this story, and has been throughout history a practice that gave voice and agency to those who had none.Drag being sexual in the function of a story hour or a brunch is ridiculous — as ridiculous as Republicans and these bills are dangerous. It isn’t drag queens or adult performers grooming children.Let’s jump to the next bill for clarity.In KY’sSenate Bill 150, Republicans are on the bandwagon of attacking transgender people, in this instance particularly vulnerable youth. The hateful legislation seeks to allow educators to refuse to address students according to the pronouns of a student’s wishes and would also allow parents to preview course materials relating to human sexuality which opens the door for obscenity claims and other religious and moralistic artifacts leaking into the educational environment. The goal here is to equatebiological sex to genderwhen all current study and research has clearly made distinctions between the two. So any use of pronouns or educational materials that contradict this woul be vulnerable to further attack.Another bill,HB 470which would restrict transyouth medical care. Both bills would force the adults in the lives of these children to become unsafe spaces for their needs.Are the people who sponsored these bills doctors? Not one. The only medical professionals include aregistered nurse,an audiologistanda speech pathologist. None qualified to make finite decisions about the physical or mental health of those who would be affected by these bills.In fact,Oldham County Republican Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, one of the signatories and the prime sponsor of the anti-drag bill SB 115, lists herself simply as a realtor and christian, nothing more, nothing less than a piece of paper saying she took some courses in real estate and an affiliation with religious dogma.This entire group is a mishmash of generic religious affiliations (every one of them lists their faith and unrelated experiences that give them absolutely no authority nor credibility to give, legislate or have any say in medical decisions between doctors and their patients, parents and their children, educators and their students, nor the skill and knowledge to create legislation that will absolutely result in the death of more queer children. Furthermore, the absolute gall of this group of godly folks to sign onto such a bill when the statistics of their churches’ horrific sexual abuse crimes is so well-documented and public.Studyafterstudyhas linked high religiosity to instances of child sexual abuse. In short, it is the people who support bills like this who also give their time and faith to organizations with opportunity and documented track records of grooming children for abuse. Like I said, it isn’t drag queens. Yet, these individuals decided to co-sign this vile and dangerous bill even after one oftheir colleagueslost a child to suicide for the very reasons this bill should be dead on arrival. It s gross and just another piece of evidence that Republicans only care about their own freedom, yours doesn t mean shit.So what should Kentuckians do? Follow the children.Each week, students from area schools are walking out of their classrooms to protest against these bills and in support of their friends and their own lives. As I’m writing this, a group of sixth graders at Noe Middle School are finishing their protest.They know what the adults around them seem to ignore — that letting these bills go unchecked, without a battle is unacceptable. If 11-year-old kids are fighting for their rights, we should be right behind them and it is time the fight got its hands dirty. We’ve been too quiet and too kind to this right-winged, religious subterfuge for too long. We can t continue to meet these people half way, be accommodating or even civil. It s time to end the GOP for good.*** ."
eugeneweekly_2023_61,"We ve got issues. What happens in rural Coos County, more than 100 miles away from Eugene, may not seem very important to Eugene politics. However, the happenings in the rural areas of the state that surround our metropolitan area inherently have an effect, both direct and indirect, on our politics and our life. I just moved to Eugene from having spent five years in Coos Bay. I was a leading activist there and attended every major event, protest, commemoration, city council meeting and more while there. I took up a specific struggle against fascist forces there because I could see that they were rising and planning to try taking power. I had to move unexpectedly to Eugene last summer, but I’ve been keeping track of what’s going on. Rodney Taylor, who participated in the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, has won a seat on the Coos County Board of Commissioners. He now plans to institute his Christian nationalist, anti-homeless, anti-LGBT+, anti-labor agenda, which is based on decoupling from the state and federal funds, milking Coos County of its natural resources and giving into all the chauvinist, backwards sentiments which fester in rural southern Oregon. Coos Bay had a few progressive moments in the last couple years. There has been no fundamental change for any oppressed community, or for the working class of Coos Bay at large, but the precedent had been set to actually move forward with progress in Coos Bay. They recognized and memorialized the lynching of Alonzo Tucker more than 100 years ago, Oregon’s supposed only lynching of a Black man (although another Black man, Timothy Pettis, was also murdered in Coos Bay 100 years ago and hasn’t been given the same recognition , and they finally recognized LGBT+ pride month and allowed a pride flag to be flown at the boardwalk. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. It seemed then that Coos Bay may be progressing, albeit slowly, and the regressive forces were losing. However, it seems the city just gives into whoever is the loudest. When the protests fragmented and burnt out in late 2020, and activists left the progressive circles based on infantile petty drama and a lack of true organization or leadership, the only forces in Coos Bay that remained active were the fascist forces. They pushed against the recognition of racist history. They pushed against Coos County’s mask mandates. They pushed against the LGBT+ pride flag being flown. The city just gave into their push against the pride flag policy and took up the position that they would not approve the flags anymore because it was a “divisive” issue. It wasn’t divisive when it was brought forward or when it was approved and flown. It was only “divisive” when the hateful forces of the county made an issue of it and said all flags had to be flown. With fascists winning in Coos County and the governments there capitulating to them, who will stop them? Who will stop the rising fascist tide in Coos County from spreading to Florence, Cottage Grove, Springfield… Time to realize politics in Coos County matters to us in Eugene. The recruitment for the fascists that clash in our streets with protesters or attack our businesses that support oppressed communities like Old Nick’s Pub happens in rural areas like Coos County. Tossing political action in our surrounding rural areas aside as many activists did in 2020, saying “those places will never change” just aids the fascist forces there, and they’ll then come here, and they’ll hurt us. Coos County has a history of racism and hate. From Tucker’s lynching to Pettis’ murder, to the age of Charles Hall and the Klu Klux Klan in Marshfield, to the white separatist Northwest Territorial Imperative and Robert Miles’ attempted move to Coos Bay, to the secessionist movements like the state of Jefferson, to the rhetoric and actions of people like Commissioner Rodney Taylor and right-wing talk radio host Robert Taylor, Coos County isveryripe for a fascist movement. That fascist movement, if it is allowed to grow and establish itself, will attack us here in Eugene and along the I-5 corridor. We have to fight back against it by organizing a united front against it, both here in Eugene and in rural Coos County. Stop Oregonian fascism in its tracks."
suffolknewsherald_2023_92,"Published 4:30 pm Tuesday, March 21, 2023ByLetters to the EditorEditor:Ah, well, here we go again.A couple of years ago the (then chairperson of Suffolk Public Schools Dr. Brooks-Buck made a public statement that White people “took offense of the racial and gender makeup of the school board.” Brooks-Buck clearly violated School Board policy by making the statement in her capacity as the chair without clearly stating the remarks were “her opinion” as required by policy that she herself passed. She never provided any facts to back that statement, and she was never held to account for the statement.Now we have a superintendent of schools that in his official capacity using the same language that any criticisms of his actions or the performance of the schools is all based on race. He makes this statement with absolutely no facts to substantiate his claim. The News-Herald published these remarks without any due diligence to those remarks.For example, “There’s certain political organizations that at the beginning of their organizational meeting, the very first agenda item is Suffolk Public Schools, and who’s going to speak at the School Board meeting, and here are the talking points that we want you to say so that people will believe that the school division is terrible.”What a ridiculous and reckless statement to make. Here is a question: Where is the proof of this? Because he says so? The superintendent of schools just charged “certain political organization” (plural of racism. What political organization? Where is the proof? And where is the challenge by the News-Herald that proves these audacious claims?The only proof of any collusion to make a race bait statement is provided in Dr. Gordons very own words, “When we had Linda Johnson, the former mayor, speak at the School Board meeting, do you know that those same individuals are now attacking her?”Time out. So, the super brought in the ex-mayor to make racially charged accusations at the last school board meeting? And now he is using her statement as proof? He did this as he is making accusations of collusion of “political groups?” The reporter that typed up this story did not challenge those remarks? Talk about collusion and hypocrisy.Racism at its roots needs to be eliminated. I think we can all agree to that. We can best stop that by eliminating those that practice the language of bigotry in their official capacity and by ignoring those that endorse the message by recklessly publishing the race baiting that it is.The good Dr. Gordon truly wants everyone to “get along,” then he needs to stop with the ignorance of calling anybody attacking the SPS system as racist and address the accreditation issue facing the school system. Maybe then people will stop challenging his leadership.Travis McKinneySuffolkCorbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

eugeneweekly_2023_1,"We ve got issues. October 7 stands out in the lived experience of every Jew. This wasn’t just another violent event among many; it was the bloodiest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. The victims were mostly non-combatants; they were babies, kids, elderly and families, and international young people at a music festival. Over 250 were taken hostage, more than half of whom are still being held in captivity. The statements by some in our community and elsewhere that justify Hamas’ acts of horror are unintelligible. These are acts that deserve nothing but our unequivocal condemnation. And yet the response from the populist Left has been to ignite a roaring flame of antisemitic Jew hatred. Instead of building international solidarity on universal claims to dignity and human rights, many activists defend atrocities committed against Jews or deny the reality of proven facts. One clear account is Hamas’ use of gang rape and torture against Jewish women. Rather than call out such acts as evil, some activists elect to deny video, testimony and medical evidence verified and reviewed by officials from the U.N., U.S., France, EU, and others. Evidence of the evil perpetrated on Oct. 7 is plain as can be. Human suffering by Jews, Palestinians, Druze and many others in the region has been an ongoing condition for so long it makes the heart break. Beyond the claims by extremists that erase the other, at core we have a conflict of identity, of narrative and of the love of a single land. Two peoples, with two different stories, each have legitimate claims to the same land. The heroes who are working diligently for a shared society are too often silenced by extremists within, and by the supposed allies in the international community, who choose sides as if this were a sports match. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Since well before Oct. 7, there has been a tendency for people discussing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to retreat into the comfort of blame to absolve themselves from feeling compassion for the “other’s” grief or indignation about the injustices they’ve experienced. Whether it’s the dismissal of Palestinian death and displacement in Gaza with the claim that there are “no innocent Palestinians,” or the justification of Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7 as “liberation by any means necessary,” the voices that are “pro” tend to express their position through a callousness about the grief of the other. If you actually care about the lives of Israelis or Palestinians, it’s time to stop being “pro-Israel” or “pro-Palestinian” and start being “pro-humanity.” One branch of criticism labels Israel as founded through settler colonialism, and therefore considers it illegitimate as a country from the onset. This critique equates the founding of Israel to the colonial projects of Europeans, in which people voluntarily left their homeland and sought advantage through taking lands far away. Those who would criticize Israel must understand that for Jews around the world, and certainly those who live there, the country represents thousands of years of hope for a return from exile and freedom from persecution. Even after the Roman Empire kicked Jews out of their homeland, there has been a continuous Jewish presence in the land for over 2,000 years. The fledgling state of Israel absorbed displaced refugees from Europe who had literally nowhere else to go after World War II. Israel has accepted hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from the Middle East, North Africa and Ethiopia after those governments engaged in ethnic cleansing or collapsed under war and famine. There is no home “colonial” state for the millions of Israeli Jews to return to. They have faced unrelenting rocket-fire from Hamas. At the same time, Palestinians have a legitimate, ancestral claim to the land. They also have the trauma of displacement, exile and unrecognized grief, and — increasingly, even in the West Bank, which is not at war — Palestinians face land seizure and violence at the hands of Jewish extremists, including in the Israeli government. Neither Israelis or Palestinians are leaving, nor should they. They deserve better than a zero-sum understanding of their situation. To pretend that either people are expendable actively undermines any long-term vision of peace and justice. What actually helps is raising up the voices of those on the ground there who are working for a shared society. The path to peace lies in creating frameworks for both Israelis and Palestinians to live in security and peace, the return of the hostages and difficult, long-term work of removing extremists from power and empowering those who seek coexistence."
suffolknewsherald_2023_143,"Published 7:13 pm Friday, January 27, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardVirginians feel better about their state than their country.That’s a reasonable conclusion to draw from the latest survey by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University.A plurality of respondents (45% to 37% said Virginia is headed in the right direction, while 50% approve of the job Gov.

leoweekly_2023_71,"Howdo we determine what we need vs. what we want? We place some things above others according to our need for comfort and perceptions of security. We do the same with our funds. We put things we need higher on the list than the things we simply want. Should our cities do the same?For instance, police are entrusted with the protection of public interests. The public interest is not necessarily human interest, but the protection of the interests of monied individuals and landowners. The problem is that this is very expensive for the public and not those with money and landowners.Is there a public service element to police work? In theory, yes.However, in certain areas of the city, this public service portion of the police occupation seems to manifest as a way to enclose and patrol the movements of Black and brown communities, poor people, and other marginalized groups. These areas are heavily patrolled, not just by officers, but also high-tech surveillance like cameras and ShotSpotter. Policing in these areas does not work for the safety of those individuals, as people in these poorer areas are more susceptible to criminal threat than perhaps other less desperate parts of the city. And cops don’t prevent criminal activity; they generally only appear at a crime scene after a crime has happened.The police are there, not to help, but to maintain a certain order that keeps the ‘unsavory’ folks away from sight. In these areas, police don’t always play by the rules and at times, blatantly disrespect the citizens and rules of decorum.Josh Wood’s piece this week about a warrantless LMPD raid in the post-‘Breonna’s Law’ climate raises these issues again — cops acting above the rules and blatantly being insensitive in order to push control on others.Will we see a change in our policing with the new Greenberg administration? The administration says that new transparency is their M.O. But will that extend to being transparent when cops fail citizens and breach their rights? Will we see Greenberg not only tell Louisville about police misdeeds, but also aggressively address it in a way that lets Louisville citizens live without fear of injury, invasion, or any other threat from the police force?LEO will certainly be watching. At some point, the story of “bad cops” needs to become measurable reforms, or better yet, dissolution of the general need for punitive forces.I’ve written before about the punitive model for policing and crime punishment and prevention in this country and how it does not work. It does not prevent nor change criminal behaviors before they happen, so we need a new approach. A completely new system that gives citizens more power in deciding how they wish to deal with the management of crime in their areas. To those who don’t know the statistics, it seems that we’re asking for lawlessness and anarchy, but, according to the Vera Institute of Justice, with low-level offenses like drug possession responsible for 80% of arrests nationwide, we could create a more effective and efficient system.Most police time is non-emergent, and that alone is enough to make the cost-benefit analysis regarding policing. We’re putting billions of American dollars into a system that runs at a huge efficiency deficit.What else could we do with those dollars? In Louisville, specifically, we could change the entire city. Put every young child in quality early education and give people who’ve been mistreated by the system real avenues to finding dignity again.So, as you read through this issue of LEO, which is about assessing value in many ways — the value of police work, the value of love, and the value of our time — think about the ways in which our money and our time is spent, and consider what’s worth it.Is policing in the way it exists worth it?Is the struggle to find love worth it?What could we do better?One thing for sure to us, at LEO, is that we could definitely spend money more wisely if cops would just act like the people they accost are, in fact, actual people with feelings, fears, and rights. This small change would eliminate a lot of city funds being spent to pay families and victims of police violence and police ‘mistakes.’*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_16,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Ohio voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved Issue 1 at the ballot, making it the sixth state to either pass a constitutional amendment protecting abortion access or reject a measure that would have specified the state constitution does not protect abortion rights. A seventh state, Montana, rejected a“born-alive” initiative that would have mandated life-saving care to a fetus born alive after a later-term abortion or a baby born with such severe health problems that it would not be able to survive.It’s a remarkable achievement, and not just because Ohio is a politically conservative state. Antiabortion state legislators tried to block Issue 1 from passing with a sneaky ballot measure in August that would have raised the vote threshold for passage of constitutional amendments (like Issue 1 to 60% from a simple majority. Supporters of reproductive rights had to fight back against a campaign of misinformation.Abortion also figured into outcomes in other elections around the country, notably in two states where it seems conservative state legislatures are at odds with their constituents on this issue. In the very red state of Kentucky, voters reelected Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who strongly criticized his Republican challenger for supporting the nearly total abortion ban in that state with no exceptions for rape or incest. One Beshear campaign ad featured a young woman who was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant but later miscarried.And Democrats in Virginia took control of the state Legislature, campaigning on abortion rights. The state’s Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke exulted in a statement, “We have thwarted MAGA Republicans’ attempt to take total control of our government and our bodies.”In election after election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade in June 2022, obliterating the constitutional right to abortion, voters of various parties in red, blue and purple states have made it resoundingly clear that they want the right to control their own bodies and that the choice to continue a pregnancy should be theirs to make, not some state legislator’s.That is a message that all elected officials should heed as we head into the 2024 elections. So far voters in elections where abortion is an issue have made it clear that they care deeply about keeping this right in the states where they live — no matter whom they voted for in the last presidential election.Will voters and candidates keep that in mind in 2024? This will be the first presidential election since Roe was overturned. In 2020, voters had the luxury of holding fuzzy views on abortion. Their rights were largely protected by the Roe decision, which blocked states from banning abortion though they could pass laws making access difficult.Presidential candidates who oppose abortion are no doubt shaken by this unbroken string of victories for reproductive rights in state elections and may soften their messaging for some audiences. Even Donald Trump, running for reelection, wouldn’t say on“Meet the Press” if he supported a federal ban on abortion, and he called the Florida six-week abortion ban, instituted by his main rival Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, “a terrible mistake” without saying whether he would support an abortion limit.This is absurd. Trump can have amnesia about his past antiabortion actions, but voters shouldn’t. In his time in office, he appointed three antiabortion Supreme Court justices who were instrumental in overturning Roe vs. Wade. Trump is largely the reason why people do not have a national constitutionally guaranteed right to abortion. If he were to win, a federal ban on abortion could all too easily become a reality. Voters should remember that when they cast ballots next year.— Los Angeles Times"
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_182,"Democrats and the independents who caucus with them will be playing defense in 23 of the 34 Senate seats on the ballot in the 2024 congressional elections. Four of the 23 are in swing states that Joe Biden won narrowly in 2020. Three are in states that Donald Trump won in both 2016 and 2020.If Democrats were to lose all seven of those, a catastrophic defeat, they would start the next session in Congress with a weak minority of senators — its fewest since the days of President Herbert Hoover — who would nonetheless represent nearly half the population of the United States.Depending on where you stand in relation to partisan politics in this country, you may not find this disparity all that compelling. But consider the numbers when you take political affiliation out of the picture: Roughly half of Americans, some 169 million people, live in the nine most populous states. Together, those states get 18 of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate.To pass anything under simple majority rules, assuming support from the sitting vice president, those 18 senators would have to attract an additional 32 votes: the equivalent, in electoral terms, of a supermajority. On the flip side, it is possible to pass an item out of the Senate with a coalition of members who represent a small fraction of the total population — around 18% — but hold an absolute majority of the seats. And this is before we get to the filibuster, which imposes a more explicit supermajority requirement on top of this implicit one.Last week, The Washington Post published a detailed look at the vast disparities of power that mark the Senate, which was structured on the principle of equal state representation: Regardless of population, every state gets two members. A carry-over from the Articles of Confederation, the principle of equal state representation was so controversial that it nearly derailed the Philadelphia Convention, where James Madison and others were trying to build a national government with near total independence from the states.It is not for nothing that in the Federalist Papers, neither Madison nor John Jay nor Alexander Hamilton attempts to defend the structure of the Senate from first principles. Instead, Madison wrote in Federalist No. 62, you should consider it a concession to the political realities of the moment:A government founded on principles more consonant to the wishes of the larger states, is not likely to be obtained from the smaller states. The only option, then, for the former, lies between the proposed government and a government still more objectionable. Under this alternative, the advice of prudence must be to embrace the lesser evil; and, instead of indulging a fruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue, to contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify the sacrifice.Today, the Senate is a distinctly undemocratic institution that has worked, over the past decade, to block policies favored by a large majority of Americans and even a solid majority of senators. And while there’s no immediate hope of changing it, a cleareyed analysis of the chamber’s structural faults can help answer one of the key questions of American democracy: Who, or what, is this system supposed to represent?As the Post piece notes, equal state representation has never been equitable: “In 1790, Virginia, the most populous state, had roughly 13 times the population of Delaware, the least populous, with a difference of about 700,000 people.” But as the country has grown larger and more diverse, the disparities have grown greater and more perverse. The population difference between the states is so large now that a resident of the least populous state, Wyoming, as many observers have pointed out, has 68 times the representation in the Senate as does a resident of California, the largest state by population. In fact, a state gets less actual representation in the chamber the more it attracts new residents.There is not just a disparity of representation; there is a disparity in who is represented as well. The most populous states — including not only California but also New York, Illinois, Florida and Texas — tend to be the most diverse states, with a large proportion of nonwhite residents. The smallest states by population — like Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire — tend to be the least diverse. And the structure of the Senate tends to amplify the power of residents in smaller states and weaken the power of those in larger states. When coupled with the potential for — and what is in truth the reality of — minority rule in the chamber, you have a system that gives an almost absolute veto on most federal legislation to a pretty narrow slice of white Americans.One response to these disparities of power and influence is to say that they represent the intent of the framers. There are at least two problems with this view. The first is that the modern Senate reproduces some of the key problems — among them the possibility of a minority veto that grinds governance to a halt — that the framers were trying to overcome when they scrapped the Articles of Confederation. The second and more important problem is that the modern Senate isn’t the one the framers designed in 1787.In 1913 the United States adopted the 17th Amendment to the Constitution, providing for the direct election of senators at the ballot box rather than their selection by state legislatures. This change disrupted the logic of the Senate. Before, each senator was a kind of ambassador from his state government. After the amendment went into effect, each senator was a direct representative of the people of that state.If each member was a kind of ambassador, then you could justify unequal voting power by pointing to the equal sovereignty of each state under the Constitution. But if each member is a direct representative, then it becomes all the more difficult to say that some Americans deserve more representation than others on account of arbitrary state borders.This brings us back to our question: Who, or what, is the American system supposed to represent? If it is supposed to represent the states — if the states are the primary unit of American democracy — then there’s nothing about the structure of the Senate to object to.It’s plain as day that the states are not the primary unit of American democracy. As James Wilson of Pennsylvania observed during the Philadelphia Convention, the new national government was being formed for the sake of individuals rather than “the imaginary beings called states.” And as we’ve expanded the scope of democratic participation, we have affirmed — again and again — that it is the people who deserve representation on an equal basis, not the states.There is no realistic way, at this moment, to make the Senate more democratic. But if we can identify the Senate as one of the key sources of an unacceptable democratic deficit, then we can look for other ways to enhance democracy in the American system.I know that, given the scale and scope of the problem, that does not sound very inspiring. But we have to start somewhere.© 2023 The New York Times Company"
suffolknewsherald_2023_84,"Published 5:03 pm Tuesday, March 28, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardAmerica’s foreign relations are way outside our lane of community journalism, but we’re keeping a close eye on growing tension between this country and China, and how elected leaders in Richmond and D.C. are responding to it.Western Tidewater has a lot at stake, after all: namely one of our anchor employers, Chinese-owned Smithfield Foods.Democrats and Republicans don’t agree on much these days, so when politicians as ideologically diverse as our own Sen. Mark Warner and Arkansas U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton deem China one of the greatest threats ever to America’s economy and national security, and when the sharply divided Virginia General Assembly passes a bipartisan bill to ban Chinese (and other foreign adversaries’ ownership of farmland in the state, it gets our attention.It’s also getting the attention of Smithfield Foods’ senior management.CEO Shane Smith went on the defensive in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, declaring that the company is “as American today as we were in 2013,” when China’s WH Group bought Smithfield Foods for $4.7 billion.Smith went on to note that the nation’s largest pork processor has flourished since the ownership change, with annual sales increasing from $13 billion to nearly $18 billion and U.S. employment up by 3,000 jobs.Despite lots of local handwringing at the time of the sale, Western Tidewater has fared pretty well under Foods’ new ownership. After being shut down like most all workplaces during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the headquarters campus in Smithfield is now busier than ever, from our vantage point. Recent changes in production processes, such as the announced elimination of pet food processing, were a fact of life locally even before 2013. We don’t blame the Chinese owners for working to be more efficient, as all companies must do to survive.Notably, WH Group has kept Americans in charge, typically promoting from within to fill senior management vacancies. Smith himself has been with Foods since 2003, rising through the ranks.Yet, we worry, as political rhetoric escalates, that one of our region’s anchor employers, on which many Suffolkians count for a paycheck, could become collateral damage in one of the biggest international conflicts of our lifetime.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_41,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Over the last two weeks, Jenna Ellis, Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell, three lawyers central to Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, pleaded guilty in the Georgia racketeering case against the former president and 18 co-defendants. All admitted significantly lesser crimes than charged and escaped prison time.Prosecutors may be more interested in Trump himself, but the lenient plea deals fail to comport with the culpability of these and other lawyers in Trump’s plot against the election. Eight attorneys were indicted in the Georgia case, and the federal indictment of Trump in the Jan. 6 plot includes five attorneys as unindicted co-conspirators, unnamed but identifiable as Powell, Chesebro, Rudolph W. Giuliani, John Eastman and Jeffrey Clark.Lawyers weren’t just involved in Trump’s plot; they devised and enabled it. Lawyers developed the strategies, manufactured a faux constitutional crisis and manipulated legal requirements in the effort to keep Trump in power and give his attempted coup the trappings of legality and legitimacy.Only lawyers could have performed these services.It was clear that Trump had lost the 2020 election by early December of that year. But rather than accurately advise him that there were no further legal options, Chesebro circulated a memo outlining a plan that would circumvent court losses, subvert states’ certified electors and allow Trump to win. What could transform defeat into victory? The lawyer’s craft: manipulation of law and fact.Tellingly, the attorney co-conspirators have protested that they were just providing legal advice. Before her tearful guilty plea on Tuesday, Ellis asserted that the Georgia indictment was “criminalizing the practice of law.” Chesebro once contended that their advice was simply “the kind of war-gaming that attorneys do.”Despite these lawyers’ readiness to help Trump overturn the election, the judiciary had proved fairly impervious to his assault of over 60 postelection lawsuits. That wasn’t happenstance. Lawyers are required by the rules of procedure and professional conduct to have a reasonable basis in law and fact for anything they submit in court. They also have a duty of candor to the court requiring them to identify controlling contrary arguments.But attorneys’ advice to clients has been treated differently. Lawyers violate the rules on advice only if they “counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent.” That means lawyers can even advise clients to engage in illegal conduct as long as they don’t know it’s criminal or fraudulent. Moreover, lawyers are not required to have a reasonable basis in law and fact for their advice or to identify contrary precedents.This is particularly problematic in the context of legal advice to government officials regarding the use of their power. Such advice shapes the use and abuse of government authority, which belongs not to officeholders but to the people.With the exception of Clark, who worked for the Justice Department, the implicated attorneys were private-sector practitioners advising the president. Because they didn’t formally work for the government, they weren’t bound by federal regulation of government attorneys or the entity rule, under which a government lawyer has a duty to the government itself and not merely an official.Even when advising Trump as to the use of government power, these private attorneys had no duty to anyone but Trump. Consequently, they acted entirely in Trump’s personal interests, bending law and fact to his interests, even against the interests of the government and people.Take the false elector scheme outlined in Chesebro’s Dec. 6 memo. Eastman, Giuliani and Ellis would all join Chesebro in advising or implementing the plan, with Eastman drafting his own now infamous memos. The plan was to recruit fake electors in seven states and assert that Vice President Mike Pence had the power to refuse to count the supposedly disputed electoral slates.Chesebro emailed detailed instructions for the false electors for each state to make sure they cast their votes in the manner set out by law and provided counterfeit elector certificates to print and sign. The idea that this technical “compliance” with law would somehow render these slates legal would be laughable if it weren’t so dangerous. Chesebro had the phony electors sign certifications that they were “the duly elected and qualified Electors” from those states, which they emphatically were not.These electoral slates were a machination that the lawyers treated as fact and the basis for their advice that “7 states” had “transmitted dual slates of electors.” In fact, not a single state or authorized representative had created or certified these slates. Eastman nevertheless advised, “The fact that we have multiple slates of electors demonstrates the uncertainty of either,” lending the counterfeit slates the same efficacy as those certified by the states. This advice would have usurped the states’ constitutional power to elect the president and given it to the federal executive branch.The attorneys’ advice also incorporated the false assertions that the election was stolen or fraudulent. Attorneys promoting a radical scheme to disenfranchise more than 26 million voters had a duty to ensure that their advice was grounded in fact.Most government officials have at least qualified immunity for actions taken in carrying out their duties. Knowing that officials might not be held accountable for their actions should compel lawyers to act with even greater fidelity to both fact and law when advising government clients. Preposterously, Trump is now asserting immunity for “organizing” the false electors.If lawyers can manipulate law and fact to justify whatever a government official wants, then official immunities can become a license for oppression, abuse and lawlessness backed by the full weight of government power.Trump certainly wanted to stay in power at all costs and refused the counsel of many good lawyers and advisers who told him he had lost. But what if Chesebro, Eastman, Ellis and Giuliani had told him the same thing?Trump would have had nowhere to go. He could not have come up with the false elector scheme on his own. He could have fired off angry tweets, ranted at rallies and thrown dishes and ketchup, but he couldn’t have undermined the electoral process without the lawyers who crafted the plan.And without the phony electors, none of the efforts to use them to undo Joe Biden’s victory would have occurred: no pressuring of Pence to reject the votes, no rally in Washington to “encourage” him in that direction and no storming of the Capitol.State bars can begin to respond to these glaring deficiencies by enacting professional conduct rules for lawyers advising government officials, including private lawyers. These rules should specify that lawyers owe a duty to the public to uphold the integrity of our constitutional system and the office being advised. The rules must require lawyers to have a good-faith basis in both law and fact for their advice. And state bars should discipline lawyers who don’t.Lawyers swear an oath to uphold the Constitution. That oath is meaningless if they fail to protect our system of government from those most likely to subvert it: lawyers themselves.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

leoweekly_2023_26,"Tryingto keep one’s place in the universe protected is tough work. It is never good to wish harm upon others or to actively harm others. At some point, the universe will correct itself, and the harm will come back to you.Do Republicans know this? Do they realize that the retribution of the universe (or of the person they call God might be so forceful that their downfalls will be powerful and public? I mean, we’re seeing pieces of this unfold with Donald Trump and the litany of legal issues he’s facing, some of which he’s already under indictment from.Regardless, I can’t imagine being so heartless, cruel, or blatantly evil as Republicans in America have been in the last few years. Their attacks are widespread against many, including women, Black people, Asian people, and those in the LGBTQ+ community, particularly individuals who are transgender. They’ve damaged the livelihood of all of these groups and are gloating over their spoils.One of the more sinister plots of the Right is how they have used Asian people as pawns in the fight to destroy Affirmative Action, which benefitted white women the most. The false claim that talented Asian students were overlooked in favor of other groups, particularly Black students, is being used to stir fear in the Asian community. The truth is different, Asian students represent the highest number of admissions of color at many U.S. universities, especially in the Ivy League schools, more so than Latin or Black students.But more to the point, Republicans are on a wild path of bad deeds and it’s time for some checks and balances. Certainly, we need to vote but it’s more than that. From school boards, to city councils to the White House, those of us who are opposed to the actions of the Right Wing need to organize actively at all levels of governance and public service to build walls against them.How far are we going to let them go before they are rounding people up into train cars and shipping them off to slaughter? We’ve seen this movie… this history before.When the U.S. District Court Judge David Hale rescinded his previous block on the Kentucky ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors allowing the ban on this care to take effect, Republican candidate for governor and general human waste farm Daniel Cameron gleefully sucked his flippers at the chance to insert his thoughts into the issue, calling it a win for “parents and children.”Cameron, a new parent, said in a statement issued after the ruling saying, “Moving forward, my office will continue to defend Senate Bill 150 and stand up for the right of children to be children, free from the influences of leftist activists and radical gender ideology.”Oh, Daniel — here is where I mind my space in the universe but issue what is as close to a curse as I will ever come — may the leftover feather on your next chicken wing poke your esophagus on the way down.Maybe us radicals on the left would rather you Right Wing loonies keep your invisible men to yourself and out of our panties, and those of underaged children, you fucking weirdos.Okay, what I’m getting at with this whole thing is this… Republicans are due for a curse, ahem… a course correction and I think one is coming. Daniel Cameron losing the governor’s race is a good start but clearing the Republican refuse in the Kentucky General Assembly and other state governments is even better.•*** ."
eugeneweekly_2023_20,"We ve got issues. Given the ballooning expense to build a new stadium for the Eugene Emeralds — now projected to cost more than $100 million — and a lack of transparency related to the future maintenance, operating costs and the community’s return on investment, Lane County should pause this project. As a sports fan and Ems sponsor over the years, I want to see the team continue to play ball here. As a concerned citizen and as a taxpayer, I want more transparency. Owned by Elmore Sports Group Ltd., an out-of-state for-profit company, the Ems have proposed paying 20 years of rent and equipment in advance to get the project off the ground. That’s $13 million the county could use toward construction, but it is still rent — money the county would be entitled to anyway for use of the stadium. It is not an outright capital contribution. By prepaying, the Ems are in essence locking in their rent for 20 years — that’s a pretty sweet deal. In comparison, the owner of the Hillsboro Hops is contributing $75 million of the $120 million it will cost to build that team’s new stadium. Other proposed funding includes $1.5 million in federal tax dollars, $7.5 million in state tax dollars and $35 million in local lodging tax dollars — all public funds. All told, that’s $57 million, if you count the prepaid rent. The remaining $43 million is still a question mark. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. It’s important to note that lodging tax dollars are to be spent on projects that support tourism. If we spend $35 million in lodging taxes to fund this project, it will tie up our local tourism fund for 20 years, meaning no major projects could be funded to support tourism for two decades. Where will it be built? The Ems are asking Lane County to carve out 9.5 acres (20 percent to build the stadium at the Lane Events Center — an allocation that could force large conferences and events to look elsewhere, reducing overnight stays and visitor spending. An example is the annual Oregon Logging Conference that generates $5.5 million in economic impact from visitor spending each winter. Are there any guarantees? Despite their request for a huge financial commitment, there is no obligation for the Ems to remain in Eugene or for Major League Baseball (MLB to keep them in the league. The reality is that there are dozens of minor league ballparks around the country that sit empty after municipalities spent millions in taxpayer dollars to build them. A reorganization by MLB just three years ago left 40 municipalities seeking long-term solutions for their stadiums. Baseball stadiums cannot be easily repurposed. They are built for one thing — baseball. Proponents claim that a new stadium will reap economic benefits, but studies conducted by economists and tourism experts have invalidated the idea that publicly funded baseball stadiums are financially profitable for anyone other than the teams’ owners. In a study published by George Mason University, economist Dennis Coats concluded that despite the millions of dollars spent, little to none of that money makes its way back to taxpayers who subsidize teams by building new stadiums. How much will a new stadium cost to maintain? Who will pay that expense? No credible economic analysis or pro forma operating budget has come to light that answers these questions. This stadium decision shouldn’t happen in an information vacuum or without the consideration of other projects that might produce a better return on investment, like an all-season indoor sports facility that could host large-scale tournaments and also serve as a critical emergency shelter — an identified top priority. On August 22, Lane County commissioners will consider whether to 1 proceed with the design and permitting, which could cost upward of $5 million; or, 2 put the Ems stadium project on hold until questions are answered and funding is secured. Once the design and permitting happens, the pressure to close the $43 million gap will rise exponentially. Where will those funds come from? As much as we all love the Ems, this stadium is not a home run for our community. Email County Commissioners and ask for an intermission until we have answers."
suffolknewsherald_2023_102,"Published 6:03 pm Friday, March 10, 2023ByLetters to the EditorEditor:According to Virginia Code, school boards play a crucial role in the oversight of the budget submitted to them by the superintendent and have the authority to revise and to ultimately approve the budget. The norm and best practice of a transparent school board includes presenting and explaining the budget to their constituents. The budgeting process can be complex and challenging as it involves balancing the needs of students and employees while also considering the financial resources available. However, when done effectively, budgeting can help to ensure that schools have the necessary resources to provide students with a high-quality education.One important aspect of school budgeting is ensuring that the budget aligns with the school district’s strategic plan. The board’s strategic plan outlines the goals and priorities of the school district, hence the budget should clearly reflect these goals. This may include allocating resources to areas that have been identified as priorities, such as improving student achievement, supporting professional development for teachers, and enhancing school safety. By aligning the budget with the strategic plan, the school district ensures that its resources are being used in a way that supports its long-term goals.Another important aspect of school budgeting must address schools that continue to struggle with student achievement, year after year. Budgets must reflect additional support and resources for these schools to improve. Allocating additional resources to these schools for specific teacher training, for classroom management or to fund an analysis of curriculum efficacy at these schools may be clearly designated within the budget.Finally, presenting the budget at open town hall meetings in every borough well ahead of board approval, is a board “best practice” practiced by many school districts around the state and would benefit Suffolk. The budget belongs to the school board and is funded by taxpayer dollars. By engaging with the community in this way, Suffolk Public Schools would demonstrate collaboration with the community leading to greater stakeholder support for the school district.Sherri StorySuffolkCorbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_131,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Artificial intelligence is developing faster than many of us can imagine and is now becoming an integral part of everyday life. So far, businesses are the primary catalysts for this deployment. Studies show that in one year of introducing a new type of AI, one-third of respondents reported their organizations were using the technology in some form, and 40% expected to up their usage investments.As we saw with the development of computers, once the workforce gets a taste of advantageous technology, it’s likely irremovable. And that is why our policymakers must get off the sidelines in regulating AI.Despite AI’s burgeoning usage, Americans are just starting to warm up to the technology in many ways because of the “unknown” factor. In the same vein, they are skeptical that elected officials can get enough of a grasp on the gravity of AI capabilities to regulate. Recent polling found that 57% of voters said they were extremely or very concerned with the government’s ability to regulate AI to promote innovation and protect citizens effectively. While these voters are rightfully concerned and calling for action, it’s important our lawmakers approach this issue delicately, not applying too broad a brush but also not letting perfect be the enemy of good.Some legislators in Washington are catching onto this. Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., is a part of the bipartisan Senate AI working group to create rules to protect Americans from AI while promoting its potential uses. At an event in October, Young said the United States should use a “light touch” when regulating AI. He emphasized the importance of harnessing the power of AI, stating that “our bias should be to let innovation flourish.”He also argued that the government must safeguard Americans from the risks that come with AI. He says this will involve carefully filling the gaps within existing laws.There are several possibilities for how to go about regulating AI. In October, the White House issued an executive order regarding AI that will require safety assessments, research on labor market effects and consumer privacy protections. The Department of Defense also announced a Generative AI Task Force. In Congress, there is the Senate working group, while House Democrats have also announced an active group to enact legislation authorizing more programs and policies geared toward harnessing the power of AI.No matter what form it takes, the regulation of AI will involve a tightrope walk that balances protecting national security without choking off potential innovation. Regardless of what future legislation and rulemaking will look like, most voters have indicated they are concerned with the government’s actions so far. While discussing how we could potentially regulate AI is continuing, tangible movement is just beginning.Americans, regardless of their political perspectives, are concerned about inaction. The ball is in Congress’s court to take these concerns and enact meaningful, bipartisan legislation to keep pace with the development of AI by regulating its risks and capitalizing on its rewards."
suffolknewsherald_2023_220,"Published 6:47 pm Friday, August 18, 2023ByStaff Reports“Light in a messenger’s eyes brings joy to the heart,and good news gives health to the bones.” — Proverbs 15:30“Won’t You Be My Neighbor?” by Fred Rogers“It’s a beautiful day in this neighborhood,A beautiful day for a neighbor.Would you be mine?Could you be mine?”There’s a good chance this song, one of over 200 songs written and sung by Fred Rogers, is now in your head. I’m hoping that it made you smile. I like to smile. I even like to smile at random people I’ve never met. The best is when they smile back.I do this from Food Lion, to Sentara Obici Hospital, to our city parks, even at the DMV — can you believe that? Now, time for confession: I don’t always do it, but I try to be intentional and authentic about it as much as possible. Some may think I do this because I’m a pastor. That’s partially true, but most folks won’t know I’m a pastor when I’m in Crocs and an old T-shirt grabbing bananas, or beer, at Kroger. Perhaps my attempts are because I admire Mister Rogers so much. Perhaps I do it to be a good neighbor, as Jesus commands, and as Fred Rogers taught for decades. There are other reasons as well.If you were to consult scientific research, you would find that smiling is good for you. It’s good for others as well. Personally, I need all the help I can get for good health.As humans are quite amazing at adapting to a changing world, research has shown that many of us now process the smiley face emoji just like we do a smile from a human face. It releases all sorts of good chemicals in our brain. This helps to reduce stress, boost our mood, even fight depression and physical pain.The church I serve with as pastor recently installed a new sign. It was expensive. We are grateful for the gift someone left for this purpose. Yet, I worried for a bit about spending all this money on a sign. We want the sign to be more than just a place for advertisement of our activities. We want it to help our community and especially spread the Good News. So, on a regular basis, as you drive on Godwin Boulevard between Oakland and Chuckatuck, you will see a big ol’ smiley face. It’s meant just for you.Simply put, the more we smile, and the more we make others smile, our individual and communal health will actually improve. Sure, it won’t solve all our problems, but even a little momentary uptick in our general well-being is worth seeking.Give it a try. Smile more. Smile for no apparent reason. Smile because the person you are walking by is a child of God, just like you — no matter who they are. Smile because it improves your health. Smile because it builds communities, and strong communities have fewer problems.

suffolknewsherald_2023_109,"Published 5:27 pm Tuesday, February 28, 2023ByJen JaquaThe years 1938 to 1940 were shadowed by full blown war in Europe. Several such headlines and stories bannered the front pages of the Suffolk News-Herald.On June 4, 1939, it was reported the SS St. Louis, a ship carrying 907 Jewish refugees, was denied permission to dock in Florida after already having been turned away from Cuba. Forced to return to Europe, many of the passengers later died in Nazi death camps during the Holocaust.Other war headlines included “Nazi planes attack British fleet at sea, claim another carrier sunk,” “Berlin claims Warsaw ready to surrender,” “Germany planning blitzkrieg on the Allies,” “Italy warns U.S. Sale of Destroyers to England ‘Dangerously involves country in Europe’s war,’” and “British continue attack on Nazi industrial areas.” Every day brought more news as seemingly the entire world was pulled into war.On Oct. 16, 1940, hundreds registered for the first peacetime draft in the U.S. Young men aged 21-35 swarmed to the designated registration places. At Suffolk High School, one of several locations, an average of 54 men were registered every 20 minutes. A total of nearly 5,000 men were registered. Two weeks later, on Oct. 30, a headline read, “First peacetime draft lottery over.” About 40 men from Suffolk and 80 from Nansemond County were included in the first draft call.Business in Suffolk continued to prosper and grow. On Oct. 24, 1938, the minimum wage was set at 25 cents an hour by the Fair Labor Standards Act.In a Jan. 11, 1939, story, headlined “Churn defined skating limits,” the police chief informed parents to caution children about skating in the downtown area. Skates must be removed to cross streets, and at no time must they skate in the street. Skating was only permitted west of Chestnut Street, north of Seaboard Railway, east of Liberty Street and south of Norfolk and Western Railway. Any skating inside these boundaries would be cited.In June 1939, work started on a new theater to be built at the rear of a preexisting North Main Street building. The Pitt-Roth Movie House was expected to cost $100,000. Instead of just another theater, the corporation decided to build an amusement and recreation center offering a modern theater and a 10-lane regulation bowling alley. The new motion picture palace would occupy the space at the rear of the North Main Street building at the time occupied by the Suffolk Floral Gardens and Saunders Service.The News-Herald often highlighted unusual farm stories. One such story on July 19, 1939, was titled “W.E. Harris grows large cucumbers.” Harris, who resided on the Rosedale Farm near Zuni, brought two cucumbers to the offices of the News-Herald measuring about 25-inches long. These were supposedly not the largest of the crop. Several had been pulled on his farm that measured 35 inches from tip-to-tip. Harris often experimented with different varieties of corn. He had been working for several years to develop better strains and varicolored types of corn. He reported corn growing on his farm which was solid blue and another variety containing nine different colors on the same cob.A local favorite to this day, the Peanut Fest was held in August in the late ’30s. A special treat was reported on Aug 9, 1939, in an article titled “Jumbos eat jumbos as Suffolk gives elephants a feast.” A herd of five of the largest animals In the world — circus elephants — ate their fill of the largest peanuts in the world, in the largest peanut market in the world. Trainer Buck Taylor put his mammoth charges through a variety of stunts for the amusement of thousands of children and adults who packed the traffic-cleared square in front of the City Market. An hour before the demonstration took place, trucks arrived and unloaded tons of peanuts in the middle of the street. Hundreds of youngsters waited patiently on the sidewalks to get a glimpse of the mammoth beasts who were to be the guests of honor at the greatest peanut feast of the century. Workmen ripped open the bags of peanuts and soon a pile more than 20-feet in circumference and some 6-feet high stood in the middle of the street.Although the war was raging in Europe, here in Suffolk it seemed times were prosperous and full of growth.Jen Jaquais the creative director for the Suffolk News-Herald.

suffolknewsherald_2023_37,"Published 5:11 pm Friday, May 26, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldMemorial Day is a solemn national holiday that like many other days of remembrance, and for reasons both seasonal and societal, has had its meaning largely subsumed.Don’t let it be.We won’t print a paper here, but we will cast an eye toward both the somber ceremonies taking place and the ongoing commitment of many of our fellow citizens. We have our share of important symbols to their sacrifices made here in Suffolk and encourage you to visit one.One of those is the annual Memorial Day observance at 10 a.m. Monday at Albert G. Horton Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery, 5310 Milners Road.The ceremony honors and remembers all men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice in service to our nation, from the Revolutionary War to present day. In one of the most beautiful patriotic displays you will see, American flags will be placed at each grave in the cemetery by volunteers prior to the ceremony.The event is free, and you won’t regret attending. In fact, you’ll be a better person and citizen for having gone.Speakers at this year’s ceremony are Army Maj. Gen. Jerry F. Prochaska, deputy director of Suffolk-based Joint Force Development and Design Center, and Matthew T. Sullivan, chief financial officer of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration.Whatever you do this weekend, guard against the inertia and blissful ignorance afforded us by having our all-volunteer armed forces and a modern style of warfare that sometimes conceals the magnitude of their challenge. Don’t allow Monday to be entirely about the finishing of school years, opening of pools and shopping for sales. Take more than a cursory pause between bites of barbecue and leaps off the diving board.Memorial Day was actually initiated as a way to honor those who died fighting the Civil War, but it was rightfully expanded to encompass all American casualties.As our nation is increasingly divided by political squabbles of the day, a time to honor those who gave their lives to defend our freedom and the principles of our democracy is even more meaningful.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_166,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°A sign points the way to an early voting location in Phoenix, Arizona on Oct. 16, 2020. (Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images/TNS Yajaira Gonzalez became a U.S. citizen and a registered Democrat on the same day.She arrived from Mexico 20 years ago, and was granted temporary legal status in 2012 after President Barack Obama established DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The policy allows some immigrants who were brought illegally to the U.S. as children to avoid deportation.After Gonzalez married and gained citizenship, joining the Democratic Party seemed a natural step. She appreciated the party’s relatively supportive stance toward immigration and immigrants, a contrast with the antagonism of Republicans under President Donald Trump.But Gonzalez, a scholarship coordinator at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, has been disappointed with President Joe Biden.“He made many promises, and many of them he did not keep,” she said. “I would like to see immigration reform for undocumented immigrants and a path to citizenship for ‘Dreamers,’” — as young immigrants under the DACA program are known. “I would also like to see more Latino people in the next president’s Cabinet.”Gonzalez said she could see herself backing some other candidate for president in 2024 — a Republican, even — depending on his or her views on immigration. First, though, she would “have to see what their platforms are.”Gonzalez, 28, was among those who took part in a nationwide survey conducted by The Times in partnership with KFF, a nonprofit formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation.Her views — an affinity for the Democratic Party but a willingness to consider alternatives — reflect a widespread ambivalence among a voting group that is considered an essential part of the Democratic base.The survey was conducted earlier this year among more than 3,300 immigrants, who were interviewed in one of 10 languages. The first-of-its-kind research was intended to develop a clearer picture of the immigrant population in the U.S., where roughly 1 in 6 adults were born abroad.In recent years, much attention has focused on two sets of voters considered key to winning the presidency. The first is blue-collar workers in the industrial Midwest. The second is college-educated residents of the Sunbelt’s burgeoning suburbs. Both remain crucial to the prospects of the two major parties.But The Times/KFF poll suggests there’s another potential swing group: the nation’s immigrants.Among its gleanings, the poll found that the American dream is alive and well, at least among those who came from abroad, despite the sour mood that suffuses much of the country.Overwhelming majorities of those interviewed said that their financial situation was better because of their move to the U.S. and that educational opportunities for themselves or their children had also improved.Turning to politics, the survey confounded some of the conventional wisdom surrounding the immigrant community and its presumed partisanship. While leaning Democratic, the ranks include a large number of voters not strongly wed to either major party.Asked which party better represents their political views, about a third said the Democrats, while 16% named the GOP. A quarter said neither party, and the rest were not sure.Ali Mostashari is one of those with little use for either of the major parties.“The way I look at things is not very ideological,” said the 47-year-old biotechnology executive, who emigrated from Iran a quarter-century ago and lives in upstate New York.“I’m less interested in partisanship. I’m more interested in finding common ground and negotiating ways to find not the ideal solution where everyone optimizes their own, but one where we can actually create less conflict,” Mostashari said.Though he considers himself “more on the liberal end of things,” the self-described political independent values practicality and pragmatism and doesn’t see much of either coming from Democrats or Republicans.He’s not alone in his discontent.“I don’t think there’s a party out there that really represents most of middle America today,” said Shawn Chen, 42, who came with his family from Taiwan when he was 9 years old. He lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, and works for a supply-chain firm.Chen left the GOP about 16 years ago, put off by President George W. Bush and some of his policies. But he didn’t join the Democrats; Chen sees both parties caught in the grip of special interests and too profligate.“From an economic standpoint, all we do is spend,” Chen said. “Our national debt is growing at a significant rate, and it doesn’t seem like there’s an end in sight from either party.”Strikingly, given the hard-edged rhetoric of Trump and fellow Republicans over the last several years, the poll did not turn up a huge Democratic advantage on the volatile issue of immigration.Just over a third of respondents said immigrants in the U.S. have been better off under Biden, while 16% said they were better off when Trump was in office. About half said it made no difference who sat in the White House.Immigrants were also asked which party they perceived as representing their interests. Under half — 46% — said Democrats did so very or at least somewhat well, compared with 20% who said the same about the GOP.At least 3 in 10 said they were not sure how well either party represents immigrant interests.In focus groups conducted as a part of the nationwide survey, some respondents said they felt the country’s immigrants were being “used as pawns” by politicians seeking office or were being courted “just for their vote.” Many said voting made no difference.Julian Mensah, who spoke in a follow-up interview, said politicians had done little to address what he cares most about: social justice.“I just feel there’s a lot of lip service,” said Mensah, 38.An immigrant from Ghana, Mensah arrived in the U.S. with his family at age 2. He raises money to help run one of Dallas’ largest homeless shelters, and though he’s a registered Democrat, he considers himself more of a political independent.“At the end of the day, nonprofits kind of jump in to fill the void that government entities aren’t really addressing,” said Mensah. He feels most political power these days rests with “old white males.”He added: “I just think they aren’t in touch with my generation.”That’s a widely shared sentiment regarding the two presidential front-runners.“I feel like both candidates, Biden in the Democratic Party and Trump on the Republican side, don’t represent the views of most Americans,” Chen said. “You have two angry old people that really talk out of a lot of hatred instead of focusing on key issues we have in this country.”If Trump, 77, and Biden, 81, end up as the two major-party nominees, it could take a good deal of persuading to convince a significant chunk of the immigrant population to support either with very much enthusiasm.And given the nation’s deeply discontented electorate, is there anything more American these days than that?Mark Z.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_189,"It has become impossible to distinguish between Israel’s decidedly non-surgical operation against Hamas militants in Gaza and the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians. When so-called humanitarian pauses in the bombardment and ground operations are too brief to realistically permit innocents to flee, or when there is no place for non-combatants to go that is not also in the line of fire, such pauses are so deficient as to be meaningless.It is time for a cease-fire. It is time for the Biden administration to assert strong and sustained pressure on the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to stop attacks that have reportedly already killed more than 11,000 Gazans. The world cannot stand by to witness more slaughter of civilians.No one should harbor illusions about Hamas, the radical militant organization that serves as the de facto Gaza government and began the current hostilities with its murderous Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israeli civilians. Militants killed about 1,200 people and continue to hold more than 200 hostages— Israelis, Americans and others.Israel claims Hamas has used Shifa Hospital as a command center and weapons warehouse. Although Israeli soldiers who entered the hospital were able to produce little evidence of that, there is no reason to doubt that Hamas would treat Palestinian civilians as human shields.But Hamas’ atrocities do not justify atrocities in kind. Following Hamas’ initial attack, Israel instructed the people of northern Gaza to leave their homes and made no commitment that they would ever be able to return. Israel’s reprisal destroyed homes and cut off power and communications, making it impossible for survivors of the bombing even to search for the remains of family and neighbors beneath the rubble.Now Israel is signaling that it will step up its assault in southern Gaza, into which much of the territory’s population of more than 2 million have crowded in response to the warnings to flee the north. They will not be permitted to enter Egypt on Gaza’s southwestern border, and they cannot enter Israel. They are trapped.Already, more children have died in Gaza in the last month than in all other conflicts around the world this year, according to Save the Children. That cruel fact is one of many that have turned world opinion against Israel, and against the U.S., its chief ally and the provider of most of its weapons. The consequences for both nations will last generations. The trauma inflicted on Palestinian survivors only increases the recruiting ability of Israel’s enemies, whether they be Hamas, Hezbollah or any successors bent on destruction of Israel.On Wednesday, the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution calling for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors” in Gaza for “a sufficient number of days” to allow unhindered access for agencies delivering aid. The U.S. did not vote in favor of the resolution, but importantly, also did not veto it. Still, pauses and corridors mean little if they are immediately followed by a resumption of deadly attacks.Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken testified at an Oct. 31 Senate hearing that a cease-fire would “simply consolidate what Hamas has been able to do and … potentially repeat what it did another day.” But neither Israel nor the U.S. has explained how Hamas can be eradicated or removed from power without an unacceptable level of civilian deaths and casualties. Nor have they set forth what they intend to happen next. Israeli occupation?On his visit to Israel in the wake of Hamas’ initial attack, President Biden noted that the U.S., following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, made mistakes. The statement was a clear message to Israel: Don’t blunder as we did. Don’t squander the goodwill of the rest of the world by killing civilians. Don’t mimic your enemy’s cruelty. Don’t leave a power vacuum that can be filled by other, even more potent enemies. Have an exit strategy.Remaining mindful of America’s mistakes, it is incumbent upon the Biden administration now to avoid complicity with Israel’s. We are past the time to excuse the horror in Gaza. Biden has to press Netanyahu hard to stop the mass, indiscriminate killing. That starts with a call for a cease-fire.—Los Angeles Times Editorial Board"

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_170,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Robert Crimo Jr. leaves the Lake County Courthouse following a hearing for charges on seven felony counts of reckless conduct on Jan. 26, 2023, in Waukegan, Illinois. (Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune/TNS Robert Crimo Jr.’s guilty plea to reckless conduct for helping his son obtain authorization to own firearms three years before Robert Crimo III allegedly opened fire on Highland Park, Illinois, paradegoers should be a wake-up call to everyone: If you hear or see things about potential violence, you must alert the authorities. And if you do things that could potentially enable it, you will face legal consequences.Crimo Jr. agreed earlier this month to plead guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail and two years on probation. He also will have to complete 100 hours of community service.Prosecutors alleged that Crimo Jr. ignored signs that his son was a danger to himself and others yet signed for him to obtain a firearm owner’s identification card, which is required to buy guns. Just months before the state permit was issued in 2019, a family member contacted the authorities and said Crimo III had threatened to “kill everyone.” Police removed 16 knives, a dagger and a sword from the home in response to that but did not make any arrest.After that incident, Crimo III bought several guns, including a high-powered rifle that prosecutors say he used in a mass shooting during Highland Park’s July Fourth parade in 2022, killing seven and wounding dozens more.While prosecutions against family members of mass shooting suspects are rare, the case against Crimo Jr. is not exactly an outlier. James and Jennifer Crumbley, the parents of a school shooter in Oxford Township, Michigan, are awaiting trial for their alleged roles in the slayings of four students by their son in 2021. The Crumbleys are facing involuntary manslaughter charges that they have fought and failed to get dismissed. Their final appeal was to the Michigan Supreme Court, which decided in October not to hear their case. If convicted, each parent faces up to 15 years in prison.Their son, Ethan Crumbley, pleaded guilty last year to killing his classmates at Oxford High School. His parents are accused of ignoring their troubled son, who was just 15 years old, and instead of getting him help, they allegedly bought him a gun as an early Christmas present in 2021, just days before he went on a shooting spree.Obviously, the Crumbleys have the presumption of innocence for now, but the fact that they face trial is a good sign and should put parents everywhere on notice. Accountability is an important safety net for all communities.Parents should make sure they do not enable things like this and have to speak up. Notably, even people speaking up about seeing or hearing something alarming it is not guaranteed to stop a determined shooter.After a 40-year-old man, Robert Card, killed 18 people and wounded 13 others during a shooting spree at two locations in Lewiston, Maine, last month, it was reported that authorities were told of warning signs but may have dropped the ball.According to reports, in the months before the Oct. 25 shootings, Card told friends or relatives that he was hearing voices and planning violence and that he demonstrated alarming behavior. Family members and colleagues in his Army Reserve unit did the right thing and alerted the authorities, including the Sagadahoc County sheriff’s office and the Army, but not enough was done.For parents, friends and colleagues, the simple mandate still applies, perhaps now more than ever: If you hear or see something, say something. And if agencies receive reports from someone’s parents, friends or colleagues of a potential threat, they should follow through to ensure potential shooters are not overlooked. Too many lives depend on it.Attorney Jeffery M. Leving has dedicated his career to safeguarding children and reuniting them with their fathers.Emmress Ann Harpole, 75, of Hilo died July 29 at home.

A world at war was the main topic of every front page of the News-Herald for several years.Almost immediately after the United States entered the war, talk of rationing began. The top headline of the Jan. 28, 1942, paper read, “Nation faces rationing of all commodities sold by stores; price fixing near at hand.” The story stated that living costs had risen more than 11% since September 1939. In another story on the same page, it was predicted that taxes were expected to be higher than in previous years to fund the war effort.In May 1942, the Coach Company bought a property at Saratoga and Cherry Streets to erect a bus terminal; it would open in April 1943. An inset story detailed plans for an upcoming gas ration, which took effect before the end of summer and would continue the duration of the war. It was just one of many items rationed. Meat, razors, sugar, gas, mileage, tires, canned, dried and frozen food, alcoholic beverages, shoes, coffee, and many other items were rationed, according to various stories on the front pages throughout the war years.On Feb. 4, 1942, all clocks shifted ahead one hour. For the remainder of the war, a nationwide, year-round Daylight Saving Time schedule was kept. The purpose was to conserve resources such as heating oil and electricity for use in war.Even during war, relaxation and rest are needed. To assist this, the Suffolk library opened Sunday afternoons to provide servicemen a place to read, listen to music, dance or just relax. A group of volunteers served the men refreshments.With attack by air a real threat, films such as “Fighting the Fire Bomb” instructed individuals on how to protect themselves from incendiary bombs were presented to the police, as well as several local banks. This was one of several examples of training given to the public to prepare for possible attack.Along with new air raid sirens, in June 1943, Suffolk began an observation post. The post operated by volunteers that for a minimum of two hours a week observed and reported airplanes to the Army headquarters in Norfolk.In late August, the Suffolk airport was completed. It had three 500-foot runways, a single beacon light and only a dirt driveway. No barracks or buildings had been built. The airport was leased upon completion to the U.S. Navy until the end of the war and then six months thereafter.Suffolk was still a small community. Several front page stories detailed the efforts citizens went to to assist each other in times of challenge. One such story detailed the efforts of the fire chief while on vacation with the help of his acting fire chief.“If your cow gets stranded on the house roof or the cat falls in the cistern, don’t despair — just call the fire department, for its members apparently know all the answers. A sparrow got into the Suffolk News-Herald composing room, some time during the night. Then the frightened little bird flew up into a skylight, where it was beyond the reach of workers. As morning advanced and the heat mounted to a point closely approaching that of Hiram’s forge, the bird’s distress increased — heat goes upward, you know, and there was no ventilation in the skylight. Fire Chief J.H. Bangley, apprised of the situation, came with Acting Chief J.W. King — Chief Bangley is on vacation — and with the aid of a ladder and a net attached to a pole, finally scooped the frightened bird from its heated surroundings. The bird was released and the firemen departed with the staff’s thanks.”On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

The children are invited to celebrate and search for eggs, but just like the story of bunnies who lay eggs, there is often little truth about why Christians celebrate this special time of the year.Those big celebrations often appear to coincide with the times of unconnected events in our Christian faith. Some “celebrations” are fun, especially for little children, even though they have no relationship with our Christian faith.So how did all this about Easter become connected with our Christian faith? It may be shrouded in the history of Rome.We know the word Easter comes from the Roman goddess Eostre. The day for Easter is determined by the vernal equinox; so this year, 2023, it falls on the second Sunday of the fourth month.Christians will not be remembering that false goddess, but rather the death and resurrection of the most important person of all history — an event which took place 2,000 years ago with the ignominious death of Jesus the Christ who had done no evil but was despised by religious and other rulers.To know more about this One sent from God to save us and make it possible for us to have a new life, we must go to the only true and accurate record, the Bible. The Old Testament sets the stage with prophecies. The New Testament confirms them. Matthew is first with the fullest account.This Sunday, we will again remember the terrible death of the One man who had done no evil, Jesus Christ. He came in human form, sent from the Creator, God, in His love for a creation lost in sin.Jesus would die on that cross, but He would rise again and be able to give us hope and the promise of a new life when we confess our sins and choose to worship Him. Christians will be remembering these details on “Good Friday,” but rejoice in them as God’s plan for our salvation.I am filled with joy when I remember the political powers that tried God’s plan and found they were no match for the Eternal God. Because of this, I have no fear of death. Because He lives, He has promised life eternal to all who believe and receive by faith in His message of salvation.Myrtle V.

suffolknewsherald_2023_236,"Published 5:17 pm Friday, July 21, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldDean Ridings, chief executive officer of one of the trade organizations to which we belong, America’s Newspapers, penned this editorial in response to the newest congressional effort to bolster a free press in America. We pass it along with commendation.It’s no secret that recent years have been tough on small businesses and on newspapers. A bipartisan bill, the Community News & Small Business Support Act, introduced in Congress would offer relief to both newspapers and local businesses.For too many newspapers, help can’t come soon enough. Economic challenges have resulted in too many communities seeing their local newspapers being forced to lay off staff, cut back on publication days or — worse yet — close. On average, two newspapers are closing each week. That hurts local businesses and residents in the long (and short run. However, despite the challenges, what remains true is that local newspapers make a difference in their communities.But don’t just take my word for it. Let’s look at the numbers and why America’s Newspapers has been pushing for the Community News & Small Business Support Act to be introduced.A recent national study of 5,000 Americans over the age of 18 was conducted by the independent research firm Coda Ventures for America’s Newspapers, and it provides compelling evidence of the importance, relevance and vitality of today’s newspapers in the American media landscape.Readers told us that their local newspaper makes a difference. The study shows that 79% of Americans read/use local news “to stay informed” about their cities, counties and communities. All of that takes a committed, local staff — something the legislation introduced by U.S. Reps. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., and U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., will help make happen.So, what would this legislation mean to your local community?Businesses with fewer than 50 employees would receive a five-year non-refundable tax credit of up to $5,000 in the first year and up to $2,500 in the subsequent four years based on their spending level with local newspapers and local media.For local newspapers, a five-year refundable tax credit would help them hire more journalists to bring you more news. It’s a win-win for local communities. Newspapers would receive a tax credit to be used for the compensation of journalists. The credit would cover 50% of journalists’ compensation in the first year and 30% of compensation (up to $50,000 in the subsequent four years. This tax credit would only be available to local community papers with fewer than 750 employees and, if they don’t invest in their newsroom, they don’t get the credit.And these tax credits are only available to local newspapers. National newspaper outlets are not eligible.The importance of local newspapers and local business is the reason Reps. Tenney and DelBene introduced the legislation. We are most grateful for their support.We need your support, as well, to encourage legislators to enact this legislation. Please contact the offices of your senators and representatives in Congress and encourage them to add their support to this legislation. These tax credits aren’t permanent; they will sunset in five years. But these critical five years will allow the newspaper industry the time needed to address the challenges that it is facing from Big Tech, which often uses newspapers’ content without compensation, as well as other technological and market challenges.More local reporting means more access for hometown news that citizens like you rely on. And stronger newspapers mean stronger advertising vehicles for local businesses.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_127,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In exchange for approving a supplemental national-security bill providing aid to Israel and Ukraine, Republican lawmakers are insisting on a far-reaching crackdown on the flow of migrants at the US’s southern border. Many Democrats continue to resist the GOP’s demands. They should reconsider.The Republicans’ plan is not unreasonable. They want to increase detentions of unauthorized migrants, curb the use of “humanitarian parole” to release asylum seekers into the US, and require that migrants apply for asylum in countries they pass through before arriving at the border. They say these measures would deter people from giving themselves up at the border, requesting asylum and then being granted entry until their cases are processed, often years later — an influx that is overwhelming communities stretching from El Paso to New York City.Faced with criticism from Democratic mayors, President Joe Biden’s administration has backed some GOP proposals, including toughening the “credible fear” standard that migrants would have to meet in their initial screening to determine their eligibility for asylum. But Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Senate Democrats have balked at harsher restrictions and pushed to include a path to citizenship for the more than 2 million undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children, a group Democrats refer to as the Dreamers.Republicans have refused to give ground. Last week, they blocked Schumer’s attempt to advance the national-security bill, increasing the likelihood that the Pentagon will run out of aid for Ukraine in early 2024.It’s fair to say Republicans are acting cynically. But such is life in divided government. Failing to make an immigration deal that unlocks additional Ukraine aid would hand a Christmas present to Vladimir Putin and waste the $110 billion in US taxpayer money that’s already gone to defend the country. It would also scuttle Congress’s best opportunity in years to make meaningful reforms to an asylum system that both parties describe as broken — at a time when daily border crossings have reached a record high. If Democrats think they can reject efforts to restrict unlawful entry and escape blame for the results, they’re deluding themselves.Biden needs to step in. He should insist that Democrats redouble efforts to reach a deal, despite potential opposition from progressives, and lay out the terms he’d be willing to accept. The White House appears to have signaled some openness to additional deterrence measures, including expanding the government’s authority to deport unauthorized migrants and sending some to third countries while their cases are processed. That should be the basis of compromise. A policy that combines tighter restrictions on asylum with more funding to hire immigration judges and protections for at least some of the Dreamers — those who’ve been in the country for more than 10 years or have earned college degrees, for instance — would be in the interests of both parties and provide a first step toward comprehensive reform.The disorder at the southern border has fractured the Democratic coalition and damaged public support for admitting the foreign talent that the US needs to compete. By fueling populist anger, it’s also making Donald Trump’s election next fall more likely. If the Democrats miss this opportunity to address the problem, the whole country will pay the price.— Bloomberg OpinionNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."
suffolknewsherald_2023_21,"Published 8:44 pm Friday, June 16, 2023ByStaff ReportsThe third Sunday in June is the time to celebrate fathers. On the second Sunday in May, moms got a lot of attention, cards, visits, flowers and maybe chocolates.Now it is time to celebrate our dads. We know we would not be here without a mom, but neither would we be here without the man who fathered us.A gift for fathers might be a tool or some new technical device. That is just one way we know dads are different from moms.When I think of the human creation it is very obvious God had a special purpose and design in mind for each person born. There is often little we can compare, but I think it was God’s intent that a man and a woman would need to learn how to become “one,” especially when it comes to having children and a family.The child needs both a mom and a father in the home. God’s creation has been that from the beginning. for each of the first two humans made in His image. No two people are just alike.Let’s rejoice today in fatherhood as God planned it.First, the man was stronger than the woman. God put the man in charge of all that He had made. That presupposes he would be the leader. Let’s not forget he took the woman from a place near the heart of the man, from a rib. That should teach us God’s desire was that a man was to love a woman, not treat her with wrong intentions.What lessons can we learn about the fathers in the Bible? We find in the scripture stories of many men who must have had some direction from their fathers. Lamech’s three sons were multi-talented. One became a tent dweller, a second son became a musician and a third became an iron forger. Joseph was a very loved son but a very mistreated brother. He is credited with rescuing the family in a time of serious famine. Kindness must have been something he learned from his father who sent him to check on his brothers. Abraham was fatherless when he cared for his nephew. Caring for relatives was a characteristic in his life and in the life of other Bible characters. No family or children are mentioned when we study the life of some prophets, but Elisha called Elijah his “father.” That tells us older men can help provide guidance to young men.Sadly, in today’s culture there are many children who have not had the opportunity to know their fathers. How do we respond to that? Our wonderful God of love knew His creation would make wrong choices and choices have consequences. Women want and need attention and are easily charmed. They may fall for a man with low standards, someone who had no intention to take a wife. These men did not understand the purity of love as God planned it, did not want the responsibility of a family.The idea of home life was not appealing and the relationship broke up, sadly often repeated with another woman. Those ruined lives of women had to find other ways to cope.What about the children? Who is a father they can count on? Thankfully we have a wonderful promise in the scripture. God has promised to be a “Father to the fatherless.”Psalm 68 says “Sing to God, sing praises to His name…A father to the fatherless and a judge for the widows… is God who makes a home for the lonely…only the rebellious dwell in a parched land…The Lord gives the command, the women who proclaim the good tidings are a great host…”Single moms can find strength and guidance in God’s word. Proverbs will help them learn how to train the children in the right ways of life.There is blessing for fathers and God will perform what He promised to women and children who trust Him when there is no father in the home. What a gracious God is ours and how we can thank Him today for His blessings!Myrtle V. Thompson is 95, a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_6,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Los Angeles is a city where the closure of a one-mile stretch of freeway triggers a state of emergency.It’s true that the 10 isn’t just any freeway. It’s one of the busiest corridors in the country, and the primary route between east and west Los Angeles. The section of the 10 Freeway damaged Saturday morning by a pallet yard fire is a major artery carrying some 300,000 vehicles in, out and through downtown most days. (The fire is being investigated as arson. So the temporary shutdown is a big deal. It’s also a painful reminder of Los Angeles’ transportation challenges. This sprawling region, where many people commute long distances to jobs and school and for other needs, remains too dependent on cars as the primary mode of transportation. Past temporary freeway closures have been considered so potentially catastrophic that they were given names like Carmageddon and Jamzilla. And now we have the Palletpocalypse.In an ideal world, a freeway closure wouldn’t upend lives and businesses. With more bus and rail lines, along with faster, reliable service, there would be no need to panic. Travelers would have ample choices to get to their destination, and with fewer passenger cars on the road, cargo trucks could have easier passage.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom have pledged to get the 10 Freeway fixed and reopened as fast as possible, which is good and necessary. But why stop there? They should also push for a rapid expansion of transit service. That would serve travelers now during the closure and encourage people to keep using transit after the route reopens.Indeed, Metrolink, the six-county Southern California commuter rail network, announced it would temporarily add six round trips between Union Station and Covina on the San Bernardino Line, which will mean trains run about every 30 minutes. Metrolink has aspired to provide such frequent service to make its trains more appealing to commuters, tourists and leisure riders in advance of the 2028 Olympics. But why not plan to make some of these changes permanent?Transit advocates want L.A. and California leaders to turn this emergency into an opportunity, by accelerating existing transit services and programs. For example, Los Angeles could speed up the installation of bus-only lanes in areas affected by the 10 closure so riders don’t get stuck in traffic.Metro could boost service on the E Line, which runs between East Los Angeles and Santa Monica, paralleling the 10 Freeway. By giving the light rail line priority at traffic signals and running trains more frequently, more riders could be enticed to use the system and, ideally, keep riding after the 10 reopens. Metro, however, is taking a wait-and-see approach, a spokesperson said, and will increase service if ridership increases. This seems like a missed opportunity.Los Angeles has been on a public transportation building boom, thanks to voters who have approved four sales tax increases since 1980 to pay for bus and rail projects and programs. In fact, over the summer, Metro opened the Regional Connector that ties together three rail lines along one route under downtown, providing more direct access to the city center and eliminating the need to transfer for many riders.Get the 10 Freeway fixed and reopened quickly. But don’t let this crisis go to waste — Los Angeles can use this moment to build a better transportation future.—Los Angeles Times"
eugeneweekly_2023_46,"We ve got issues. Human, All Too Humanis the somewhat haunting title of one of Friedrich Nietzsche’s books from 1878. What does it mean to be human today, in the Dataverse of technological mass society? Where the synthetic, the virtual, and the prosthetic seem more and more to displace, or even define life. When we ponder Progress, what is it that we are progressing toward? What happens to our humanness as the Machine takes over more and more of our lives? One take on all this is to reverse the perspective, to look at humanness at a time when there was no technology. Tools, yes, but no systems of technology. What were our Homo species up to many, many years before our vaunted Homo sapiens tribe came on the scene? At a site in Israel, it was recently found that people were cooking fish there 780,000 years ago. It is also pretty clear that scavenged or hunted game was cooked by fire in Africa about a million years ago. In recent decades, anthropological literature has pushed the emergence of Homo sapiens back a bit. In much of the 20th century our species was thought to have begun about 50,000 years ago. The consensus starting point now is more like 200,000 years ago. And the standard for Homo sapiens is its resemblance to “behaviorally modern” humans, or symbolizing humans. You know… the presence of or capacity for art, number, time measurement, and the like. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. But as I’ve already pointed out, human intelligence was capable of a lot, a very long time before any evidence of symbolic culture. Evidence of stone tool use 3.4 million years ago stands out. The superbly crafted Acheulean hand axes and scrapers had a million and a half year run, with their exquisite tear-drop shape and edges often sharper than steel surgical knives. There were sea-faring humans in the Pacific as of 800,000 years back. But cognitive ability is only a part of what it is to be human. InThe Wisdom of the Bones, Alan Walker and Pat Shipman ponder the situation of a woman who lived 1.7 million years ago and suffered from vitaminosis A, a “completely immobilizing” condition. She lived for some months after its onset. “The implication stared me in the face,” wrote one of the authors. “Someone else took care of her, or she wouldn’t have lasted two days in the African bush.” An almost unimaginable span of time ago, there were social bonds in band society of face-to-face equality. The evidence is there, of both intelligence and humanness. Are we not struggling for both, here in the technosphere, where the symbolic is all that’s left? We are progressively de-skilled and beleaguered in spirit, as the planet is ever more ruined. Can we reconnect with our aboriginal humanness?

leoweekly_2023_40,"Itis said that when a woman has a baby her DNA changes with the creation blooming inside her. She is forever shifted and connected primordially to this new soul. I was 42 when I had my first, and only son. Nothing has gone as planned.I have always wanted to be a mom but did not think it would happen for me. I married at 38, and we were not sure if a child was an option or if we even wanted to be parents. My mind was already damaged from all the years of social work. I knew exactly what was going on in the world and was unsure I wanted to bring a life into that energy.We watched our friends’ families begin, and it was an amazing experience to see growth from the people I love. We knew it would be difficult because I was older and not in the best of health with obesity and some managed health issues. We began our attempts, which lasted about six months before we gave up and I accepted that it was not meant to be for us.My husband and I decided to plan our future with travel and adventure so we booked our first trip into the woods for our anniversary in June. We would eat, drink, stay naked all day, create, and hang with mother nature to toast to our newly defined future.I found out that I was pregnant a month before we were to embark on our woodsy celebration of being childfree creatives. When I told my husband, he could not speak and probably saw his, or my death, flash before his eyes. He was speechless, and unnerved. I was not afraid.I have always wanted to accept life as it was presented to me, and to strive for blessings in whatever situation I found myself in, even if it meant not getting what I wanted or causing strife and challenge to the journey.For us, our son Vincent, was simply meant to be.Pregnancy came easy for me aside from some changes in my palate. I was monitored relentlessly for the high risks of being an older mother. For the first time in my life, I felt the feeling of not being alone in the most symbiotic way. This baby relied on me for everything and I spoke to him often — a constant dialogue that continues now that he’s 12. I shared my fears that I was too old to give him the energy needed for motherhood, and shared my excitement over who he would become. We were both evolving into a new world that was a family.My scheduled and induced delivery was set and turned into the most unnatural experience of my life. I just wanted both of us to survive. I labored for three days, had different doctors probing around my nether regions, strange devices inserted that meant to force dilation, and chemicals to induce progression for natural delivery. I came to the solution that my cervix was petrified with age as I never progressed beyond four centimeters. It was a nightmare, and my doctor was leaving for vacation to Australia. It was evident that he had already left in his mind.My husband was reaching critical mass on day three, ready to slam the doctor into the wall for the neglect, but the physician was already on a plane.Vincent’s heartbeat weakened and a whole team of people rushed in, rolling me around like bread dough to get the heartbeat back. At that point, I’d had enough, did what I’ve had to do all of my life — without fail — and stood up for myself. I demanded to speak to the legal department about why the medical staff was not moving forward with surgery. My politeness left my soul. I found myself in a queue of women also waiting for their surgeries. I distinctly remember thinking this was like waiting at Jiffy Lube for an oil change.Finally, Vincent came via emergency cesarean by an OB/GYN I’d never met.The only voice I heard throughout was the anesthesiologist. He got me past all the fears that I was not numb enough, and stayed with me through the surgery. I do not remember seeing my husband’s face but I had seen many births before and knew he would be forever changed by the experience.After the tiger cub scream that told the world a new soul was here, Vincent was shown to me like a puppet from behind the sheet separating my head from my body, and then whisked off for all the usual tests and documentation.I knew at that moment something was going wrong inside me. I felt like I was suffocating. I shared my fears and the voice of the anesthesiologist continued to keep me calm. The countdown for stitches and instrument accountability filled the room. They were in a hurry and I wanted to get off that table and hold my baby.After some time in recovery, I got my wish. I looked into his squinty eyes and laid him on my chest to make sure he remembered the body that housed him. I could feel myself change as I began healing and bonding with this new little person. My body, forever changed from the experience, was entering another, more perilous journey. This was just the tip of the iceberg.• ( ."
philinquirer_2023_7,"I am a resident physician in West Philadelphia, and most of the patients I see who make a full recovery after cardiac arrest have been white. We can do more to erase these disparities. Damar Hamlin is alive. Not only is he alive, but he is home; heattended a Buffalo Bills playoff gamelast month andhas spoken publicly. Let the gravity of that sink in. After his heart stopped beating on national television, after his teammates mourned while helay lifeless on the ground, andafterspending nearly one week in the ICU, he is home. The sole reason for this miraculous recovery is because Hamlin received high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. » READ MORE:NFL players like Damar Hamlin aren’t paid enough, given the danger of football CPR saves lives. Yet nationally,only 46% of people whose heart stopssomewhere outside a hospital receive CPR. And Black people, who are twice as likely as white people toexperience a sudden cardiac arrest, areless likely than white people to receive CPRfrom a bystander. This is regardless of if they are at home, in a public location, in a predominantly white neighborhood, or ina predominantly Black or Hispanic neighborhood. Unfortunately, this trend is seen even here in Philadelphia, where those who live in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods areless likely to receive CPRthan those living in white neighborhoods, and 44% less likely to survive. While these racial disparities in who gets to benefit from CPR may be jarring to some, to me they are no surprise. I am an emergency medicine resident physician in West Philadelphia. In my work in the emergency department and the intensive care unit, most patients I have taken care of whose hearts stopped did not get CPR until the paramedics arrived. Most either do not survive or survive with significant brain damage. Ofthe few patients who I have seen make a full neurological recovery from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, most have been white. The data match my experience — after a cardiac arrest in public,28.9% of white people make a full recovery, vs. only 17.5% of Black and Hispanic people. “Why do we see such disparities in CPR?” So why do we see such disparities in CPR? This is partially due to the continuous barriers to public education about witnessing a cardiac arrest, and how to administer CPR quickly. I grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Baltimore, and I never learned how to provide CPR until I was a medical student, yet many of my fellow students who are white knew what to do. They had learned these skills long before medical school. The paucity of resource allocation in communities of color — suchas the lack of Spanish-speaking 911 dispatcherswho can communicate instructions on how to administer CPR over the phone to callers when someone experiences a cardiac arrest,and the lack of public investment in CPR training— exacerbatesthese disparities. These are all offshoots of structural and systemic racism. Lastly, there is an element of implicit bias, when bystanders (regardless of race more quickly recognize the need for CPR when the patient is white. CPR saves lives. In order to fight these disparities, we must bring communities of color what they often lack: awareness and training. In 2019,Pennsylvania began to require CPR training to graduate high school, but this is not enough. CPR training needs to be brought directly — and regularly — to churches, recreation centers, and schools in communities of color. Outreach to community leaders, such as those in nonprofit organizations and religious leaders, can guide how to increase the attendance and uptake of CPR training in their own neighborhoods. I recently partnered with a local nonprofit organization, thePhiladelphia Black Women’s Health Alliance, to bring CPR training directly to the places that need it most. In an upcoming health equity summit, I will facilitate a workshop focused solely on CPR administration, and how to determine if someone is having a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital. Our goal through this workshop is to increase awareness regarding the importance of CPR in Black and Hispanic women and girls of all ages, and slowly bridge that educational gap, while garnering continued community interest for future CPR workshops through this organization. These are only the first small steps to fight these disparities in Philadelphia, but they are still steps forward. Long-term progress requires continued investment, both in resources and commitment, into communities of color. Damar Hamlin survived because he was surrounded by a trained care team who quickly recognized a cardiac arrest and administered high-quality CPR as soon as possible. Everybody deserves the same treatment. Let’s use his story to reframe the approach to CPR in our neighborhoods. If we can equip individuals in communities of color with the skill set to quickly administer high-quality CPR, then we can begin to chip away at the disparities that lead toshorter life expectancies for Black and Hispanic peoplein Philadelphia.

Uncle Sam, however, insists on sending billions of dollars of lethal arms to his allies, objectively extending and even escalating the tragically inhumane violence.In the latest United Nations maneuvering, the U.S. vetoed a Brazilian-sponsored Security Council resolution (on a lone dissenting vote, versus 12 nations voting in favor calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, to be followed by fair negotiations for a legitimate two-state solution between Israel and Palestine.Then, in the General Assembly, the U.S. side again voted with 13 others against a call for a ceasefire, versus a huge majority of 120 member states.So, who is really on the “democratic” side of global affairs and governance?

Ulysses S. Grant is president in his second term. Henry Rose exhibits barbed wire at an Illinois county fair for the first time. The first U.S. postal card is issued. Central Park is officially completed in New York City, and also in New York City, P.T. Barnum’s Circus, the Greatest Show on Earth, debuts.Here in Suffolk on Jan. 1, 1873, a divide between churches indirectly led to a Methodist man, Dr. Thomas E. Cropper, beginning publication of the Suffolk Herald. A Methodist newspaper, the Herald was housed in Washington Square. It was published every Wednesday morning and carried the banner “Fearless and Free.”In 1917, the newspaper was moved to the corner of East Washington and Commerce streets, near current-day Amici’s.Fast-forward to 1923. President Warren G. Harding is about to hand over the presidency to Calvin Coolidge. The first Yankee Stadium opens its doors. The Hollywood Sign is inaugurated in California (originally readingHollywoodland and Roy and Walt Disney founded The Walt Disney Co.On March 23, 1923, the Suffolk News began publishing for the first time as the first modern-day daily paper in Suffolk. The paper was published every afternoon except Sunday.In 1924, when the Suffolk News was at risk of shutting its doors, the stock of The Suffolk News Co. was bought by Amedeo Obici. Most known in Suffolk for being the founder of Planters Peanuts, Obici reportedly admitted to knowing nothing about operating a newspaper, but could not stand by and watch the daily paper fold. The paper was later sold to R.A. Harry.A few years later in July 1927, the Suffolk News bought out the Suffolk Herald and combined it to become the Suffolk News-Herald. The paper has run continuously under that name since.Late December 1934, the country was in the middle of the Great Depression, and food was in short supply nationwide. Here in Suffolk, things were no better. Upon hearing about the inability of churches and other local charities to meet the demand of hungry children in the city at Christmastime, the newspaper ran a front-page editorial in Dec. 18 edition. It was an urgent call for the citizens of Suffolk to help. By the next day, a committee was formed, and money had started to flow into what was originally called the Empty Stocking Fund. The name Cheer Fund was coined that second day. By Christmas Eve 1934, $501 had been raised, and the Cheer Fund was created. These days, this fund created by the News-Herald is its own nonprofit and each year collects roughly $40,000 to buy toys for children in need.The News-Herald’s original location was 151 S.

eugeneweekly_2023_11,"We ve got issues. Two weeks ago, I got an email from a constituent. She confessed that she had signed the petition to put this recall election into motion. She went on to explain that she had been lied to by signature gatherers when she signed and was angry and upset. Along with her apologies, she also asked me to please fight the recall because she was grateful for what I had done for her and our community. This email is one of many similar stories from our Eugene community. I am so unbelievably grateful for the outpouring of support and solidarity I have received in the course of this recall. Like all of you, I am also incredibly disappointed by the blatant misinformation and lying by a disgruntled lobbyist and United Food and Commercial Workers union leadership, who have abused our state’s recall system and wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars of their own members’ money that should be used to better their workers’ lives. These kinds of deceptive tactics have no place here in our community. Here’s the truth: I’m so proud and honored to serve our community and to deliver for working Oregonians for nearly 20 years. Together with union partners and workers, I was there on the front lines helping to raise the minimum wage and craft a paid family leave program that was both effective for workers and fair for businesses. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Environmental advocates like Oregon League of Conservation Voters and Sierra Club turned out hundreds of supporters to help me ban field burning in the Willamette Valley and push state policies to address climate change in our state. I have been honored to partner with farmworkers to help them to tell their story in the Legislature and ensure their right to be paid overtime, just like every other Oregon worker. Especially in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturnRoe v. Wade, I’m proud to work alongside Planned Parenthood to pass the most progressive reproductive health protections in the country. I’ve supported members of our community who have spent countless hours organizing community investments, raising private donations, and come to the state legislature to obtain public funds to complete those local projects in our community; projects like Kids Sports Civic Alliance, the YMCA, Ollie Court affordable housing, behavioral health stabilization center, University of Oregon and Lane Community College renovations, and many more. All this is why every other union and progressive organization is standing with me and opposing this reckless recall. Regardless of what happens on the Oct. 3 Election Day, I’m so proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish together, and with your “No” vote on the recall, I will continue to work for our community."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_70,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°There should be no debate over the language we use to describe Hamas and its depraved Oct. 7 attack on Israel.Hamas is a terrorist organization, and the acts of its agents on Oct. 7, when they crossed the border into Israel with the express intent of killing and kidnapping civilians, were terrorism.That makes them terrorists.While some have suggested Hamas’ political role in Gaza means it is not a terrorist organization, it is clearly targeting civilians for political ends, which is the very definition of terrorism.The danger in using euphemisms such as “militants” to describe terrorists is that it normalizes heinous acts of terrorism and implies that the deliberate targeting of civilians is a military act and that Hamas at large has some other, less despicable objective.But let’s be clear: Hamas’ stated goal in its founding charter calls for the obliteration of the state of Israel. The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada have all formally designated Hamas a terrorist organization. It should not be confused with Palestine or the innocent Palestinians now suffering in Gaza.Hamas’ terror attack on Israel is clear and indisputable proof that Hamas continues to be committed to its original goal, despite its 2017 charter revisions.The grisly details that have emerged in the days since the attack leave no doubt.Terrorists stormed Israeli towns, killing and kidnapping anyone they encountered. They recorded the atrocities on body cameras and posted the video to social media sites.Footage compiled by the Israeli government shows civilians shot in bedrooms, bathrooms and yards. At a music festival celebrating “friends, love and infinite freedom,” terrorists gunned down 260 revelers and took an unknown number of hostages. Authorities also released photographs of slain babies, their bodies shot and burnt.In Be’eri, more than 100 are known to have been killed and others were taken hostage. News reports describe homes riddled with bullet holes and cars reduced to burnt husks. In kibbutz Nir Oz, at least 20 people were murdered and upwards of 80 were kidnapped.In response to all of this, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin described the atrocities committed by Hamas as “worse than what I saw with ISIS.”Hamas currently holds more than 200 hostages from their Oct. 7 attack on Israel and has promised to begin executing them if Israel retaliates.There is a word to describe the intentional targeting of civilians to political ends, and that word is “terrorism.” Those who commit acts of terrorism are terrorists.To call these acts or their perpetrators anything other than terrorism and terrorists is not only intellectually disingenuous, it also risks normalizing such acts by obfuscating the essential truth of their nature.— New York Daily NewsHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2023_17,"(This piece comes with a little help from Rufus Wainwright Eachday in America feels like 10 years. There are daily shootings, workers are overworked and underpaid, public school systems are underfunded, so much political posturing and corruption, race relations are certainly at a bottom, and improvements in any or all of the above seem highly unlikely.Rufus Wainwright is playing in Louisville with the Louisville Orchestra on Sept. 30 and I hope that, even though he’s scheduled to play songs from his“Want One”and“Want Two”albums, he makes room for this one song from a different album, “Going to a Town.”Why?Well let’s take a look at some of the lyrics.The song begins like this:But I don’t know where I’m goingSearching for that placeIt’s not inside meI wonder where I’ll goDon’t we always linger‘Cause we know this ain’t had no goodI’m going to a town that has already been burnt downI’m going to a place that has already been disgracedI’m gonna see some folks who have already been let downI’m so tired of AmericaThe last line, which is repeated throughout the song says it all. I’m so tired of America. I’m not the only one and I know that we keep trying and trying to move forward and make it better but sometimes, does it feel like ‘horrible’ is winning? Sure, we’ve rejoiced and laughed in the face of Trump’s mugshots but until that bloated windbag is behind bars or paraded in the streets with a scarlet letter, then why are we cheering? Even if those things happen, is America any better?America is a nation of band-aid solutions. Nothing ever truly gets fixed but we are great at kicking the can down the road and hoping someone else will fix the problems we’re either too stupid or too lazy to remedy. In this last year, with all of the changes at LEO and in looking around the world, it tracks that I’m having a bit of a gloom right now. Is America still worth it?I’m gonna make it up for all of The Sunday TimesI’m gonna make it up for all of the nursery rhymesThey never really seem to want to tell the truthI’m so tired of you, AmericaMaking my own way homeAin’t gonna be aloneI’ve got a life to lead, AmericaI’ve got a life to leadI know, I know, I can hear you saying it, “But..but…Freedom.” Is it free whenever you go to a movie, or school, or a shopping mall, or any public festival that you’re hypervigilant about not getting shot in the next mass shooting? How long will we look over our shoulders, searching every angry or slightly irregular face for hints of them being a killer?How long will we pay the high costs of healthcare that doesn’t really restore health nor seem to care at all about the people it treats. Again, even our system of health kicks the can down the road hoping someone else will convince Americans to stop eating sugar, start moving more when the rest of our systems add more sugar to our diets, move us farther away from places to walk, to move, to breathe the clean air so we can do all of those things. We’re being overloaded with giant apartment developments eating away at land that could grow good, clean, healthy food in the face of American farms being shut down and the best products being shipped overseas while giving scraps to the American public.In case you hadn’t noticed, I’m feeling cynical about America. What is America, right now?I don’t want to hear about freedom but I do want us all to reflect on the ideas that America claims and what America actually is. Do we think it’s okay, and how long will we kick the can down the road before we demand that America lives up to its promises?Tell me, do you really think you go to hell for having loved?Tell me, enough of thinking everything that you’ve done is goodI really need to knowAfter soaking the body of Jesus Christ in bloodI’m so tired of America•*** ."
suffolknewsherald_2023_1,"Published 7:36 pm Tuesday, December 26, 2023ByStaff ReportsI like to remind people that Jesus was a refugee too, whenever I’m talking about the current human matters of immigration and refugee care. Born in a manger, hidden by His earthly parents in Egypt from murderous King Herod, Jesus was an emigrant, a traveler, a sojourner. So is every one of us.Of course, aside from a small population of Native Americans, there is a very practical sense in which every one of us are immigrants. The greatest telling of the American story is one of migration. People fleeing poverty or persecution arriving at the distant shores of America in the hope of a more prosperous telling of their life’s story to future generations.In 1883, Emma Lazarus penned a poem to help raise money for the construction of a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty. In it, she included the lines that have become an eternal appeal to the highest virtues of our land. She wrote, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…”The greatest achievement of America isn’t material wealth. The greatest commodity of export from America to the world isn’t material at all. Our most important export is hope. But you can’t give away what you don’t have. I’m afraid that the current turbulence and noise about immigration policies and foreign involvement is putting pressure on our highest virtues.When we scoff at the refugee, the immigrant, the migrant, the stranger, are we forgetting that just a few generations ago, that may have been our great-grandparent?If you, like me, are a follower of Jesus there are more pressing powerfully important concerns. The author and finisher of our faith was a refugee. Not only that, His life and love, His word and way, compel us to share compassion and kindness to refugees. In the New Testament book of Hebrews 13:1-2, it says, “Let brotherly love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.” (ESV There is a political and policy component to the refugee crisis that must be addressed with wisdom globally. There is a personal spiritual component that must be addressed with great care personally if we are to keep the heart free from the ugliness of dehumanization common to our time.People aren’t political issues. They’re people, many of whom fled home because, as Warsan Shire said, “Home was the mouth of a shark.”My dear friend, fellow traveler on the lonely road, remember this. When you and I look into the eyes of the man working at Walmart who doesn’t speak English or the nervous kid in class who just showed up from Latin America, we may be looking into the eyes of our ancestors or the eyes of Angel.We are looking into the eyes of fellow travelers, made in the image of God, deserving of compassion.

suffolknewsherald_2023_133,"Published 4:08 pm Tuesday, February 7, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardFor many, February is just too soon to be thinking about Christmas again. For those of us involved with the Suffolk News-Herald’s annual Cheer Fund drive, however, this is the time of year we learn just how successful the previous year’s fundraising campaign turned out to be.And what great news we received: The fund raised a record $49,425, with donations still trickling in.Ever since the newspaper launched the Cheer Fund sometime during the Great Depression, folks in Suffolk have stepped up to help those who are less fortunate. A successful Cheer Fund results in collecting donations sufficient enough to fund the purchase of toys for the following year’s effort. From another perspective, the Cheer Fund is also successful when community awareness is high about the fund drive and the distribution it supports.We’re pleased that — because of the generosity of the fine people of Suffolk — the 2022 Cheer Fund was successful on both counts. Individuals, families, community organizations, businesses and employees of government agencies in Suffolk joined forces to achieve the campaign’s goal of $40,000 by Christmas Day, then keep giving to shatter the previous record of some $45,000 in 2021.On the other side of the equation, thousands of underprivileged children in Suffolk received toys on Christmas morning because of the generous donations to the Cheer Fund and to Suffolk’s Toys for Tots.“Each year we do this program, you hope and pray that the generosity of others will come through,” said Suffolk volunteer extraordinaire Margie Wiley, whose many “hats” include guiding the Cheer Fund as its head elf. “And each year I am amazed by the citizens of our city to give back to others during the Christmas holiday season.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_89,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°If it wants to survive, Israel surely must annihilate Hamas, this ever more venomous, maniacal Islamic group of terrorists misruling a next-door neighbor, Gaza. But should Hamas’s proud, strong, enabling boss Iran also be a target with the United States participating in its demise as a world hazard on its way to nuclear weaponry? Even with Hamas gone for good, an untethered Iran would still have Hezbollah to boss around and the means of forging new Hamas-style, Palestinian invaders with civilization the final loser.Yes, it was absolutely horrendous, the Hamas invasion of Israel with thousands of missiles launched as an introduction of massacre intentions. The assault was not for the purpose of combat with largely missing Israeli soldiers as much as for the joyful torture of civilians, including the rape of young women, the killing of children while their parents watched and even cutting off the heads of babies. There was also the taking of hostages Hamas is now threatening to kill If Israel continues to fight back.These unexpected, cleverly skilled barbarians killed the most Jews assassinated since the Holocaust after inexplicably being able to cross a border supposed to be uncrossable thanks to U.S.-Israeli coordination. Conducted on an Israeli holy day, the invasion was the first inside Israel since the Yom Kippur War a half century ago and was clearly part of the frequently stated antisemitic dream of killing all 9 million Israelis while acquiring their land.It might seem ironic, but all of this inhumane outburst seems to have happened in part because of an excellent Donald Trump policy, something worthy of a Nobel Prize. He and his coordinators managed to persuade a number of Arab countries in the Middle East to form peace accords as virtual allies of Israel while also benefitting more from trade. The participants have altered the Middle East balance of power by helping themselves as much as Israel was helped by increased protection and fewer threats. Still, there was the tricky question of what formidable, sizeable, oil-rich Saudi Arabia, a past enemy of Iran, was going to do.Saudi Arabia worked closely with the United States in oil and military trade under Trump while not caring much for President Joe Biden’s doing endless, billions of dollars-worth of favors for Iran. Lately, however, there were hints that Saudi Arabia might join the Abraham Accords. Iran, which went from limping under Trump to racing fast under Biden, has been more than a little upset. It is the major anti-Israel power in the Middle East, very, very close to obtaining nuclear weaponry and would be set back if Saudi Arabia made that move. According to an excellent Wall Street Journal account superior to publicized U.S. intelligence, Iran used money and demands to get Hamas to jump in where it did not particularly want to go.The war, in fact, does seem to have caused Saudi Arabia to be less likely to make the pro-Israel move, although recent Israeli internal divisiveness, apparently seen by Iran as another advantage, has quickly disappeared.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had upset large portions of the population in wanting to limit supreme court authority, but national unity and enthusiastic support of Netanyahu became the immediate way of things with the Hamas invasion. Biden is standing strongly behind Israel but has given no indication of ceasing his appeasing approach to Iran. He should do as much immediately and definitively.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2023_9,"Fallis my favorite time of the year, and as I have aged, I am able to understand who I am on a different level. It’s the dying time, and it is as necessary as it is primal for the soul.I have learned that I must live somewhere with all the seasons as it sets the pace symbolically for how I have chosen to exist. It’s deeper than pumpkin spice and cooler temperatures, and more than the vibrant turning of the leaves, fires, and warm sweaters. It has become my reflection time on the last phase of another year of learning and letting go.It is also a magical time where adults get the opportunity to play with shadow selves that naturally whisper in their ears to frolic in the darker things. We are allowed to peek between our fingers at spooky images that excite our adrenaline and unsettle us.I was twenty-three when my father died unexpectedly, and my childhood giggles of dressing up for Halloween and spooky stuff became difficult. I fought the necessity of death in all things, and I was unsettled for quite some time as the leaves fell away to a barren landscape and the coming coldness of winter. I understood winter all too well by that time.My father’s death shoved me into a struggle with real depression for many years. I dropped out of college, gained 60 lbs. and moved home with my mother. I ravenously read books from all faiths to find an explanation as to why someone so loved and needed could be ripped away from us.In the end, I decided to become a rock, never loving anything or anyone that deeply again. I made myself invisible and was able to hide in my career as a social worker and therapist to allow hope to flow through me for others, but not necessarily for myself.I worked and made enough money to survive on. I found other souls searching during that time, and those friends were the touchstones that kept me laughing instead of crying.Oddly enough, these times were the most vibrant of all, and I have journals full of revelations and truths that had to be addressed. I found that some of the most honest conversations came in sessions with my clients, as there is no faster way to get to the truth than when you are at the bottom of the barrel with nothing else to lose.My love affair with the fall came on a drive home from a week-long training at Indiana University in Bloomington. It was a warm day in early October and the drive home to Louisville was absolutely breathtaking. The sunroof was open and all the smells and colors of fall swirled around me. My soul took a big breath and exhaled. I realized, death in this world was not something to focus on with paralyzing fear. The real answer was to face it and celebrate the blessings of life in honor of those who no longer get to witness and experience it.As hard as it is to say, my father’s death was the biggest gift of learning that I have ever received in my life. I drove through colors that I had never seen before, trees were sharing a vibrancy that can only come right before death, and I understood it completely.I separated the entire world by those that knew a real loss and those that haven’t experienced it yet. I began to see the masks that people wear with one another, and I could see it more clearly than ever before. Thus began my practice at letting go.I had a therapist for a while after my dad passed and remember walking out on her when she shared with me that I will find real healing when I could find something good in the loss of my father. I never showed up again, and remained angered for many years by her sentiment.Today, I thank her for being real with me, even if I could not understand at that time. It was too soon. I have no idea how many years it was between our last session and the awakening drive of the fall, but it started my path back to life — my life.Open your eyes this fall and let the death that is needed come. It may not be a physical death. I have had three internal deaths in my lifetime after five decades of living, and I am enjoying myself now more than ever.My father is with me at all times, especially in fall — the beautiful dying time until the rebirth of spring.• ( ."

suffolknewsherald_2023_125,"Published 4:37 pm Tuesday, February 14, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardIt is heartening to know is there are groups such as Suffolk Clean Community Commission and Keep Suffolk Beautiful stepping up to address the litter problems along Shingle Creek.Kudos to the 15 folks who turned out recently to participate in this clean up.These volunteers from the SCCC, friends of the program with the help of six Nansemond-Suffolk Academy students collected 75 bags of litter, several larger items and 19 tires along Shingle Creek, resulting in 2,300 pounds or 1.15 tons of trash collected, according to Suffolk Public Works Litter Control Coordinator Daniel McDonald. He serves as the city’s liaison for Suffolk Clean Community Commission and Keep Suffolk Beautiful.The two organizations were awarded a grant from Keep Virginia Beautiful to assist with this effort by funding use of floating booms to gather litter from the creek and push it to shore where it can be collected.It remains disturbing, however, that in this day and time we still have to battle litter problems in our city. The images from Shingle Creek in the Sunday News-Herald should serve as a wake-up call to all of us.It’s difficult to believe people still toss garbage in areas where it can end up in Shingle Creek, knowing it could end up in the Nansemond River and beyond. Additionally, all of this is too close to the Nansemond National Wildlife Refuge — an area and habitat we all want to preserve and protect.Keeping Shingle Creek and other parts of Suffolk litter free isn’t difficult.Keep America Beautiful found in its most recent national survey that 85% of littering is due to individual attitudes. Changing that behavior is the key.KAB found that one in five opportunities at disposing of something ended in littering. Dropping something that became litter is the most frequent way it occurs at 54%. Flicking and/or flinging items was next, causing 20% of litter, and 7% was simple intentional littering. The organization found that about 15% of those surveyed self-reported that they litter now, a big improvement from the 50% who said they did back in 1969 when KAB was formed.While the litter problem has improved, here are steps KAB said can take to end the it alltogether:Another important role groups such as Keep Suffolk Beautiful change these bad habits are through the educational programs they offer to our children. We are fortunate to have a strong program working on this front in our city.If you missed February cleanup, another chance to help make a difference comes next month when Keep Suffolk Beautiful holds its St. Patrick’s Day River Cleanup from 9 a.m. to noon March 18 at Constant’s Wharf Park and Marina, 100Constance Rd.Also watch for information on this year’s Great American Cleanup held each April nationwide by KAB and its local programs.By joining forces to battle litter and clean up what is out there, this is one problem we can eliminate in our lifetime.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

eugeneweekly_2023_50,"We ve got issues. Language is heavily symbolic. It is not only words, but facial and bodily expressions, energy, boundaries and silences. The meanings are contextual, cultural and latent with history, which is why, for many reasons, language means so much. What about symbols? They signal and provide guidance and information to only those introduced and trained to recognize them. Symbols indicate an understanding that also holds history, context, meaning and usually some sort of pride attached to it. When you see them, you are informed, you are linked, and you are all of a sudden “clued-in.” What does it mean for a person surrounded by language and symbols that reflect a history of violence, isolation and pain? When I write I realize that I always think of the rebuttal that comes undoubtedly from a fragile defensive space of white folx and white-adjacent folx. So, with that in mind, living within the U.S. as a Black woman is to constantly and consistently redefine the violence that reverberates in these symbols and language that are now (arguably considered patriotic. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. When you see the American flag, what do you feel? Is it clear, or is it complicated? The names of buildings and streets, hidden origins appropriated and sold back to us in ways that degrade our existence by asking permission for what was already ours. See, as we grew up, and those of us who had the protection of Black elders, community and family, we were told what was true about our history. Growing up knowing two stories: one that is true and one that is comfortable for the privileged people we had to endure. We also grew up knowing which story we would have to pretend to be true. Privileged people are ignorant to what we know. They are ignorant of the weight we carry. This weight gets passed down and so does the ignorance of the dominant culture. This ignorance is protected by the half truths of their definitions. This unfortunate dance continues. Since the events of 2020 led us to a global awakening the weight is no longer tolerable, and entertaining this ignorance is no longer a viable choice. There is only tension and choices to be made. The beautiful thing about an awakening is there is no going back. The scary part is, no one knows what it looks like to truly move forward. However, for Black people, the dominant culture made sure Black and Brown people would always be familiar with fear and uncertainty. Reminded daily — not only with relics of old language, symbols and practices that are protected by comfortable ignorance, but also by casual defiance to change. Passive statements of solidarity with no change to management are made: The “It breaks my heart,” and ”What can we do, it’s systemic?” Meanwhile, what changes have you insisted upon in a space you’re currently comfortable in? Here we are again; it’s up to the dominant culture to face what it has created. Please do not believe you are not part of the problem. You most certainly are, and the casual bystanding is how we are still here. This is not an intellectual problem. Black people not only know the answer, they are the answer. Your discomfort with the language and symbols we understand and persist in changing, the symbols that are stifling the dominant culture’s growth, is more indication of performative change, not tangible movement. When you say it is systemic, do you understand that the system is you and those adjacent to you?

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_31,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Last week, the Federal Reserve did the right thing by leaving well enough alone, keeping the benchmark interest rate at about 5.4%. With the acute pressure that the board and Chair Jay Powell in particular have faced in the past several months, we’re glad they’ve had the wisdom to know when to step back.There have been those that, wedded to formulaic understandings about the economy, have insisted it’s all but mechanically impossible for inflation to come down into acceptable ranges without seriously harming the economy. We’ve even heard that we need a recession, that a recession is the inevitable endpoint of a sadly necessary effort to wrangle inflation under control, and that the Fed should not have relented on its campaign to sharply raise rates.These critics pointed to the 1970s and the reign of Paul Volcker. When things looked grim, the story goes, Volcker stepped up and did what had to be done, pushing the economy into a recession with prolonged unemployment but in the process saving it from a worse spiral of soaring prices that threatened to derail the country’s prosperous postwar climb. The horrifying prospect that this approach may not really have been necessary is something the conventional economic view all but put out of mind.We should all be mightily thankful that Powell and his Fed colleagues didn’t listen to the naysayers, in part because of some powerful and clear-headed voices bucking the trend, including Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee. We now find ourselves right where they said we couldn’t be: not only have we avoided a recession, but by most metrics, the economy is doing great. Unemployment is low, wages are gaining after a virtual decadeslong standstill, inequality is a bit down.None of that is to say that it’s milk and honey for everyone out there; that we haven’t had a recession doesn’t mean that rising interest rates and inflation haven’t both hurt households, and the majority of Americans are still living paycheck to paycheck. The job certainly isn’t done, and a combination of factors including President Joe Biden’s continuing commitment to robust industrial policy and the resurgent power of labor organizing can keep pulling things in the right direction.Is this graceful landing the product of the particular circumstances of the contemporary economic picture? Maybe, but what isn’t?The point is that it worked, and what definitely won’t help now is if the Fed busies itself fixing what ain’t broke.Though the interest rates were kept steady this time around, Powell has repeatedly insinuated that he envisions a potential additional hike in the near term.This doesn’t sound like too big of a deal given that the Fed’s earlier series of successive rate increases did not drive us into recession already; what’s another few basis points?Yet the primary distinction between a healthy economy and a recession isn’t whether interest rates were hiked — pretty much everyone agreed they had to be hiked — but how aggressively and how quickly; the problem is that once a recession sparks, it’s next to impossible to get it back under control before it inflicts massive damage, and why would we play with fire when things are fine now?The Fed should instead revel in pulling off what some thought impossible.— New York Daily NewsHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

A more restrictive SB 47 was passed in the KY Senate. The legislative session ends March 30.24-year-oldLogan County resident Tyra Hubbard, died of colon cancer one week before she was due in court for the possession of a “small baggie” of marijuana and a grinder.Diagnosed with stage three cancer in February 2022, Tyra smoked marijuana to “increase her appetite and to help with pain,” Tyra’s mom, Sheryl Hubbard says.In Kentucky, possession of up to eight ounces comes with a maximum penalty of 45 days in prison. Possession of paraphernalia is a maximum sentence of one year.?Tyra died on October 4, 2022. She was due to appear in court the following week.??“If she had of survived, she would have been standing in court with terminal cancer... for a small bag of marijuana that she used for self-care,” Hubbard says.?“My daughter suffered, and she had this trial hanging over her head when she died.”??In November 2022, just over a month after Tyra’s death, Governor Andy Beshear issued an executive order allowing patients with specific medical conditions to receive pardon for possession of marijuana.??“I can’t put into words how grateful we are for the governor,” Kristin Wilcox, co-founder of the nonprofit organization Kentucky Moms for Medical Marijuana says, “but the executive order does fall short.”?The executive order, which came into effect January 1, 2023, states that patients must lawfully purchase medical cannabis in a jurisdiction outside of Kentucky. They must also be able to provide written certification from a healthcare provider.??The closest marijuana dispensary to the Hubbard family is a three-hour drive.?“Kentucky is a poor state,” Hubbard says.?“I can’t travel to Ohio or Illinois with a stage four cancer patient... for us normal folk, that ain’t going to happen.”?Hubbard says doctors prescribed her daughter opioids, including oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine and the synthetic opioid, fentanyl but, “none of the pain medicine would work.”?“I saw how much marijuana helped my daughter... but the court system kept her charge hanging over her head.”?Legislators have not had to “sit and watch their child deteriorate because they are in so much pain and can’t eat,” says Hubbard, who wants legislators to do “what they have to do to help people, to help my kid… a beautiful soul who is gone.?“A light in this world is gone.”?With the opening of the 2023 legislative session in Frankfort on January 3, some state representatives, as well as the Kentucky Moms, are pushing for change.Rep. Rachel Roberts filed House Bill 22, which calls for the legalization and regulation of cannabis, and Rep. Nima Kulkarni introduced House Bill 47, which relates to full decriminalization.“It could be a veteran with PTSD, a baby with epilepsy, or a terminal cancer patient,” Wilcox said.“People who need this come from all walks of life.”But as Wilcox says, patients who use marijuana for “medical purposes are criminalized... and have to deal with the court system.”At four months old, Shelby, Wilcox’s own daughter was diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome, a medication-resistent form of epilepsy that can affect childhood development.Doctors prescribed Valium in conjunction with the antiepileptic drug Depakote, which “seemed to help,” Wilcox said.But she was still having tons of seizures and was deteriorating both physically and cognitively.”It was only when they started a clinical trial for the cannabis derived drug Epidiolex that she says they saw real “cognitive gains.”“The problem, though, is that this medication costs $45 thousand a year and without Medicaid, we can’t afford that.”Shelby is now 17 years old and has been taking Depakote for 15 years.“It has really taken a toll on her body,” Wilcox said. “Her bones are brittle and her teeth chip easily.”“Medical marijuana is really the hope that we need.”Wilcox and The Kentucky Moms for Medical Marijuana want lawmakers to understand that legalizing medical marijuana would mean “supporting patients... who deserve compassion and dignity.”“We are fierce and strong” Wilcox says “but we lead with our hearts.”“We’re parents” Wilcox says “and we have this fire to do everything in our power to help our children.”Kentucky Moms for Medical Marijuana are calling for Kentuckians to “speak to their legislators and elected officials and push them to get this done for us, because it’s beyond time.”“We’re going to fight till the bitter end to get this passed,” Wilcox says “you’re not gonna mess with the Kentucky Moms.”?•*** ."
suffolknewsherald_2023_172,"Published 5:25 pm Tuesday, December 19, 2023ByStaff ReportsNewspapers are often accused of ignoring good news. On this special day, we’re devoting this space to the news delivered more than 2,000 years ago by an angelic choir, the news of the coming of Emmanuel, God with us. Jesus was God’s gift to the world on that first Christmas, the gift of a Creator willing to take on the flesh of His created beings in order to show them the Way to a relationship with Him. That’s good news, indeed.…Luke 1:26Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,27to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.28And coming in, he said to her, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”29But she was very perplexed at this statement, and kept pondering what kind of salutation this was.30The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with God.31“And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus.32“He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;33and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.”34Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?”35The angel answered and said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.”…Luke 2:1Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth.2This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.3And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city.4Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,5in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child.6While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth.7And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.8In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.9And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened.10But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;11for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.12“This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”13And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,14“Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.”15When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another, “Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.”16So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger.17When they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child.18And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.19But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart.20The shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_105,"Published 5:30 pm Tuesday, March 7, 2023ByStaff ReportsAs I’m writing this piece, I’m thousands of miles away while on vacation with my wife. Indeed, a well-deserved vacation that has been planned a long time ago.My wife’s high school (all girls reunion was put off, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It would have been celebrated two years ago.This time, the successful well-planned and scheduled three-day event finally happened. With, of course, memories of their former classmates/high school Batch ’71 who were not able to participate because of death and/or illness.The all-female high school jubilarians’ reunion was filled with laughter and love, and memories of just being high school teens with amazing ambitions and dreams and, of course, crushes. They have had a lot of things to talk about, to catch up, so to speak. They enjoyed each other’s company. They made connections and reconnections again, after 50 years plus that they haven’t seen each other. They have had lots of fun and stories to share with each other.Such an event is a milestone, truly a once-in-a-lifetime celebration that could never be replicated. Daily themes included a Hawaiian-inspired Luau, Retro in the 70s at Casa Cecilia Hotel and masquerade ball at Mayor Germy in Caoayan. They were treated to various tours of private beach resorts. Transportation was provided by Gov. Jerry Singson of Ilocos Sur.Thanks to the high school jubilee organizers, led by Marie Rose Eleazar, Casa Cecilia Hotel owners Celia Lopez Jennings and her husband Jon, who were gracious enough to provide free accommodations to all participants and discounted hotel rate for their husbands (me, included , and lunch and dinner sponsors, and supporters like Gov. Luis Chavit Singson, Hon. Governor Jerry Singson of Ilocos Sur and Caoayan Mayor Germy Singson Goulart and Chinita Go Parilla of Bantay.You see, the participants, including their husbands, are in their mid 60s. Majority of them have retired from work. They ‘re just enjoying life and trying to have fun, good times, with as much as less stress or none at all.They’re making memories with their family and friends while they can. What else would they do but engage in activities and events that enhance and improve their quality of life as seniors or senior citizens with all the benefits they deserve.With all the things going on in the world, they have accomplished so much in their own ways, notwithstanding wealth materially or otherwise. They have acquired many life experiences that they can pass on to their children and their families. They’ve been a source of wisdom, guidance and inspiration, and great help to their fellow golden jubilarians, family members and friends near and far.Making connections and reconnections and memories are all they do, while aware of their health and other issues affecting their overall well-being. They join clubs, go on tours and travel, volunteer in their church, and meet up, while they stay focused on their health and well-being.They try their best to stay in touch with their friends and family members.Though some of them have concerns about issues related to their health and finances, they seem unperturbed by what’s going on, especially in politics and culture, and other changes and challenges. Why? Because they’ve passed that stage of always worrying about anything affecting their well-being. They let go of the past and enjoy the moment to the best they can.Though resilient they are, they’re vulnerable to everything, such as scams, diseases, disasters, fake news, while still being concerned about their lives and future.On the other hand, for retirees like me, I would suggest or say — make memories while you can, while you’re alive, able and capable. Be active and productive, positive and proactive. Be happy and hopeful, and helpful while you can.Continue to learn and grow with your faith. Cherish all the memories that you have accumulated through the years. Continue to make connections and reconnections with your past. But above all, be at peace with yourself, family and friends, and your God.Live in the present moment well, while making more memories and having fun and good times.Chris A.

Anything to look out for?-Striking While The Iron’s HotCards to Know: Strength, The Seeker, The Empress (rev. Cards to Watch Out for: The Devil (rev. , The Moon, Seven of Swords.Dear Strike,When it comes to union support, I’m Norma goddamn Rae, so good on y’all for organizing. I know it’s a tough road ahead, and with so many states being At-Will, it’s not an easy decision to rock a boat when job security is on the line, but I hope y’all can unionize and get the protections you need.Five of the six cards I drew are major arcana, so this is a mighty issue.As far as what to know, things seem pretty good. With the Strength card, I would remind you that there is strength in numbers (“solidarity forever/for the union makes us strong” , and this is something to pursue with solidarity, not force. You’re walking with a beast. The Seeker is a card unique to my deck (Uusi’sPagan Otherworlds and represents the seeking of the divine and Truth. You know this is what y’all are supposed to be doing. To help with your recruiting and your organizing, we have The Empress. The Emperor is traditionally known as the diplomatic one, but the Empress rules with love as well as discipline. It’s a card of hard workandcompassion. When drafting your demands, it’s crucial that you do not sacrifice your more vulnerable member’s needs to make something more palatable to the boss hogs.What you need to watch out for are egos and strategy. Both could sink you. The Moon is both subconscious and shadow—the parts of ourselves that we keep hidden because they’re ugly or base or selfish. With the single-mindedness of The Devil, it’s easy to see how a few egos, drunk on power or convinced that they alone are right, can send you down a path you didn’t want to go. The Devil is often a prison of our own making—or a downfall we brought upon ourselves.The Seven of Swords, too, is about choices: taking a path that leads to gloriously ego-filled gluttony and destruction or a narrow and dangerous path to freedom. Remember, unions are about the collective, the quiet voices as well as the loud, and it’schallengingto rule by consensus. It’s incredibly easy for a de facto leader to start calling shots without consulting, so be very conscious of how this plays out. Make sure there are some checks and balances for leadership and that things are brought back to members to discuss and vote on. This isn’t to say expertise shouldn’t be relied on or that smaller groups focusing on different parts of the union shouldn’t exist—but broad strategies should be agreed upon by all, not just some.By keeping the collective in mind, y’all have the strength to fight the good fight.Godspeed with your organizing, love.Dear Oracle,I’m a ”millennial” dad, happily married and raising two kids. My wife and I have a lot of couple friends and parenting friends. Usually, we both really like the wife… but the husband ends up being a dud. My wife has connected with many of these women and found great friends, but I haven’t had the same luck. I still have some great guy friends from childhood, high school, and college, but I don’t really have any that live near me. Do the cards have any advice on making dad-dude friends?- Dad-bo(n dCards: Five of Wands, The Emperor (rev. , Six of Swords.Dear DB,Adult friendships often have two issues: they can be hard to make, and the dear friends you do have end up living an airplane ride away. While modern technology has certainly made it easy to catch up with long-distance friends, no one can deny the fun of meeting up for a spontaneous dinner on a Wednesday just because you can.I’m sorry you’re dealing with some dud dads. With the Five of Wands, it does suggest that you do not see eye to eye with some of them. That might be because you disagree on more significant beliefs (different values, different lifestyles or because of more minor issues (no similar interests or sense of humor. Either way, things feel a little isolating.Fittingly enough, the lonely Emperor is the earthly father, so it’s no surprise that he’s here. He rules with diplomacy and a wide worldview, so it might benefit you to expand your social scene by trying things that would bring you in touch with a different crowd. (Or, if you’re a political junkie, working on some sort of campaign. The Emperor can also be a stand-in for the government. The Six of Swords also suggests trying something new and exploring new territory as an active participant. You might have to really put yourself out there and be the one who asks for numbers/texts/arranges hangouts. As someone who is not a cool dad herself, I don’t know where they hang out, but follow your interests/values (Community action projects? Improv classes? and see if anyone there seems like a pal.The Emperor, however, is also a card of deep thought. I don’t think shallow relationships are your thing; you might find them more draining than fulfilling. Deep friendships do take time (otherwise can be a red flag , so hopefully, you find guys who are worth it. If not, remember you have close friends who are a phone call away.I’m sorry.

Some 50 years after I fired into a squirrel’s nest, I recall the shock of seeing them plummet lifelessly to the ground as vividly as if it were only a moment ago. I’m thinking about it now.Iwent hunting once — on a friend’s farm in southwest Georgia. Some 50 years after I fired into a squirrel’s nest, I recall the shock of seeing them plummet lifelessly to the ground as vividly as if it were only a moment ago. I’m thinking about it now.In Maine this year, a high school student gutted a doe she had killed and dragged out of the woods while her friends were celebrating Halloween. She was the last animal the girl needed to get a “grand slam” patch for “harvesting” a deer, a turkey, a bear and a moose in the same year.The bear wasn’t her first. She’s shot five — the most recent was seeking refuge in a tree after the terrified animal had been chased for miles by a pack of hounds. Her victim’s skin is being made into a rug. It took her three shots to kill an 860-pound bull moose. After gutting him, she ate a piece of his heart and smeared his blood on her face to “connect with nature.” She saved his shoulder blades, legs and jawbone.Across Ohio during the state’s two-day youth hunting season more than 10,000 white-tailed deer were killed, well above the three-year average of 7,600 between 2020 and 2022. If you believe the euphemisms, those deer were also “harvested.”“It’s fun to know that you’re the one who killed it and you’re the one who found it and you’re going to skin and dress it and all that kind of stuff,” said one 14-year-old.At a hearing in New York state about extending hunting season for 12- and 13-year-olds — in Missouri, 6-year-olds can be licensed to hunt — a state legislator cut to the chase, saying that hunting is an “economic driver” fueled by new generations of hunters and then reciting the specious argument that it’s important to “deer management.” It isn’t. When deer are killed, the subsequent spike in the food supply increases breeding among the survivors and attracts more deer. If “management” means reducing populations, hunting defeats the purpose.In Wisconsin, a newspaper columnist bemoaning the dwindling number of applicants for gun deer licenses was worried that children wouldn’t learn about patience, discipline, dignity, self-reliance and generosity if they didn’t kill deer. Hunting isn’t really about guns or even antlers on a wall, he fantasized, it’s about teaching kids self-worth.He was also worried that kids who hunt are told that it’s “cruel and unnecessary.”That’s because it is. Hunting’s a blood sport, and it doesn’t teach children or anyone else anything about self-worth. What it does teach them is that the lives of other beings — who, like them, experience fear and feel pain— are worthless.Shy and inquisitive, deer only want to be left in peace to raise their families. Fawns stay at their mother’s side for as long as two years. Turkeys are affectionate, highly intelligent individuals. They enjoy exploring and form strong social bonds. Moose, who can live up to 25 years, are peaceful and rarely become aggressive.Eating a moose’s heart doesn’t connect someone to nature. We connect by recognizing that animals are the same as us in all the ways that matter. We connect by respecting their individuality and their right to live in peace.Let’s teach our children to do that. They — and the animals — deserve it."
eugeneweekly_2023_27,"We ve got issues. Bill remembers limping after injuring his left foot, but he certainly wasn’t thinking the worst. The pain continued, and he learned he had a broken toe, and to complicate matters, diabetes. PeaceHealth Riverbend quickly scheduled his surgery to amputate three toes. The 55-year-old man had recently moved back to Oregon from Georgia, where he had been working part-time in a restaurant and caring for his elderly parents during COVID. He attributes his diabetes to the sugary soda pop he drank in large quantities at his workplace, but he figured it was a better alternative than the large amounts of alcohol on which he had become reliant. When Bill returned to Eugene, he had nowhere to go and ended up living with an acquaintance. However, he didn’t want to burden him while he was recovering from surgery. So the social worker at Riverbend wrote a discharge plan for Bill to stay in a pallet shelter encampment at St. Vincent de Paul on Highway 99. It’s hard to imagine being discharged from a hospital with nowhere to go, especially when our local social safety net for people who are homeless is fragile. ShelterCare recognized this gaping hole in the health care continuum in 2013 and ever since has been providing post-hospital recuperation to people who are medically fragile and unhoused. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. While the temporary shelter was safer than the streets, Bill said maintaining a diabetic diet and caring for his surgical wounds was next to impossible. Once a chef, who prepared healthy vegetarian meals at venues like Breitenbush Hot Springs, Bill knew he needed to adopt a diabetic diet as well as dress his surgical wounds. But he didn’t have ready access to a kitchen and running water. Because Bill was able to walk, bathe himself, administer his own medications and was eligible for the Oregon Health Plan, he was approved for a room at ShelterCare’s Medical Recuperation Program (SMR on Hwy 99. Each unit has a shower and toilet, a small sitting area, and a microwave and refrigerator. ShelterCare’s 18-bed program is funded primarily by PacificSource and Trillium, both Coordinated Care Organizations for Oregon Health Plan consumers. Located in a repurposed hotel in west Eugene, ShelterCare’s SMR program has since early 2023 provided Bill with a warm room, three cooked meals a day, transportation and case management to help him heal and eventually transition to permanent housing. A visiting nurse stops by to change the dressings on his foot. Bill hopes that access to all these services will strengthen him enough for future employment. The SMR program staff have also helped Bill establish a relationship with a primary care physician. Bill’s fragile condition and acute medical needs have warranted a far longer stay than the average of 60 days, requiring his physician and insurance provider to approve extensions every month. Scott Eastman, short-term housing manager at ShelterCare, says about 30 percent of SMR’s participants are on diabetic diets, the result of not having access to nourishing foods, health care and medicine. From May 2022 to May 2023, 49 percent of SMR participants had three or more concurrent medical conditions post-hospitalization, including mental health and chronic health issues, substance use disorders and physical disabilities. SMR provides case management to facilitate longer-lasting solutions to its participants, including long-term housing. While such efforts don’t guarantee a perfect ending for everyone, some 68 percent of the program’s participants transition to more permanent housing arrangements. “We want to increase their options when they leave,” Eastman says. “It’s taken a lot of time to fine-tune the process,” Eastman admits. But the care SMR has taken to create collaborative relationships with local hospitals and insurers has paid off. “Insurers love us because we provide care at a fraction of the cost of hospital care,” he says. Eastman says there are hidden costs involved in not providing care to people who are unhoused and discharged from the hospital or emergency room. Without post-hospital care, many are readmitted to the hospital, make frequent visits to emergency departments, and have a shorter life expectancy, greater use of acute hospital services and higher mortality and morbidity. Sadly, across the country, many hospitals do not have policies that adequately address post-discharge challenges for people who are unhoused. Research shows that most people who are homeless are discharged to emergency shelters or to the streets. With few options, it is difficult if not impossible to clean wounds, prevent infections, get restorative sleep, and eat nutritious meals. Research published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information notes an increase in hospitalizations among the unhoused population. Although the reasons for the increase are not known, speculation suggests that an aging homeless population and a lack of access to preventive care may be two contributing factors. Recent legislation in Oregon emerged following the death of a Salem woman who didn’t have a place to go after her discharge in winter 2022. Seeking a change in the current state system are three Oregon elected officials: Senators Deb Patterson and Kayse Jama, and Rep. Paul Evans, all Democrats. This year, the senators introduced Senate Bill 1076, which would require hospitals to have specific procedures for the discharge of homeless patients. The bill received mixed support, Patterson writes, but a broad coalition supports another bill, SB 1079, that has established a Joint Task Force on Hospital Discharge Challenges to address the issues that hospitals face when trying to discharge patients to appropriate post-acute care settings. A broad coalition of stakeholders, including the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Associations, supports SB 1079, which has until Nov. 1, to submit administrative changes to the governor that do not require legislative actions. In the meantime, SMR will do what it can to assuage the conditions for unhoused people, like Bill, who are leaving hospitals in Eugene/Springfield, and to provide an environment that lends itself to improved health outcomes and enhanced well-being. Bill grants that his extended SMR stay has played a significant role in his healing. “I’m grateful for the ShelterCare program,” Bill says."
suffolknewsherald_2023_83,"Published 5:56 pm Friday, March 31, 2023ByStaff ReportsSpring is a welcoming season, the thought of which causes me to consider good things, circumstances and events that are coming to fruition. Among other things, I appreciate the warmer weather, birds chirping, flowers blooming and longer daylight hours. This season also has spiritual implications that speak of revitalization.Spring has become my favorite season as it transitions into new beginnings after the winter months when aspects of death occur in nature. During this season, it’s nice to get up in the morning hearing birds chirping and to travel throughout the day seeing flowers blooming. Although the official start of spring is not until March 20, it is refreshing to experience longer periods of sunlight with Daylight Savings Time.Sights and sounds of nature present at spring remind me of encouraging Scripture that centers around the blessing of God’s provision, the beauty of His creation and the assuredness of His sovereignty. Luke 12: 24 – 28 encourages me to consider that if God provides for the birds and He clothes the flowers, how much more will He do for me as His follower. In Psalm 104:12 the psalmist also acknowledges how birds nest beside the streams and sing among the trees. The writer of Ecclesiastes 11:7 commented about how pleasant and sweet it is to see the sun and to experience light.Spiritual renewal may also occur at springtime especially during the observance of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Easter, or what I refer to as Resurrection Sunday, is a religious observance of the Christian faith that is always held on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25. This year it will be April 9.Celebration of that holiday brings back childhood memories of getting dressed to attend church, memorizing and reciting Easter themed poetry, and searching for eggs during community wide events. As I mature emotionally and spiritually, Resurrection Sunday develops deeper significance. After giving my life to Christ at age 16, I have gained a greater appreciation for Jesus’ saving power as demonstrated by Him dying on the cross and miraculously being risen to life to pay the price for my sins.Acknowledgment of Jesus’ death, burial and resurrection also makes me consider His role as soon coming King which speaks of His eventual return to earth. According to John 14:2-3, Jesus said, “I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare to place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself…”“Greater is coming,” is a phrase sometimes used to brighten people’s days with hope and expectancy about what is to come. Just as Springtime brings signs of new life and light after a wintry season, Christ’s death, burial, resurrection and promise of an eventual return can bring hope and peace. For me, spring has new meaning that speaks of nature, beauty and God-given joy. It’s a great time to celebrate.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_11,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Republican presidential candidates, from left, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC participate in the NBC News Republican Presidential Primary Debate at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County on Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2023, in Miami. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images/TNS It’s difficult to name a winner in the Wednesday GOP debate in Miami given that all five of those on stage appear to be competing for silver. Yet signs abound that at least one of the contenders could yet emerge as a serious alternative to Donald Trump.Post-debate surveys revealed that Republicans felt former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis turned in the strongest performances, while entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie performed the worst. But the polling, according to fivethirtyeight.com, also highlighted that the event changed few minds and that Trump isn’t hurting himself by refusing to participate.The debate questions touched on a variety of issues, including foreign policy. Haley shines in this arena. She minced few words in taking a strong position against China, Iran and Russia, while forcefully defending the need for additional U.S. aid for Israel and Ukraine. Haley also made a cogent case that Biden administration missteps overseas have made the world a more dangerous place.Haley also stood out on abortion, which has become a major headache for Republicans. The party again suffered electoral defeats last week that many analysts believe can be traced to voter discomfort with the anti-abortion agenda. Haley said that the GOP must be “honest” with the American people about the issue and that a federal abortion ban is simply impossible given that it would need 60 votes in the Senate to pass. “Let’s find consensus,” she said, adding, “We don’t need to divide America over this issue anymore.”In contrast, DeSantis took a more hard-line stance on abortion — which is proving to be a losing hand — and, while expressing unequivocal support for Israel, outlined a less hawkish position on America’s obligation to Ukraine. He also touted his strong record on the border.Both DeSantis and Haley expressed support for Trump’s accomplishments while in the Oval Office but said it was time for Republicans to move forward.Yet the two have had trouble piercing the aura of Trump’s inevitability. It’s worth noting, however, that a significant number of GOP voters have expressed interest in supporting a candidate other than the former president. According to fivethirtyeight.com, nearly half of Republican voters say they would be open to backing DeSantis, while 38 percent say the same about Haley.A recent New York Times/Sienna College poll showed Trump leading President Joe Biden in five of six key swing states — including Nevada. But it also showed other GOP candidates faring well against the president. Haley, for instance, led in all six states — by double-digits in three of them. DeSantis was ahead in four of the states, although by smaller margins.The challenge for Haley or DeSantis will be to consolidate support as the field narrows and to convince the party faithful that nominating the baggage-laden Trump risks alienating the vital swing and independent voters necessary to prevail next November. At some point, after all, Trump will have to engage with his challengers.— Las Vegas Review-JournalRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser."

It is within these loving spaces that children have the opportunity to heal from the traumas that have shaped their young lives and the chance for a brighter and more hopeful future.If there’s one piece of advice I could offer to those contemplating working with foster youth, it is this: Above all, be kind.Expressing empathy, even in the midst of complex and uncertain situations speaks volumes. By consistently demonstrating patience and compassion, you can create an environment characterized by safety and acceptance, leading to a transformation that goes beyond the surface level.For those considering becoming foster parents or volunteering to support these children, I encourage you to explore the resources and opportunities available at rcg.hawaii.gov/.This website provides valuable information on how you can become licensed, volunteer, find support groups, upcoming trainings and events, and additional resources.By taking the initiative to become a part of a child’s life, you can play a crucial role in making an everlasting, positive impact.Naiya SpringHiloKudos for concertfeaturing pianistMahalo to the Hawaii Concert Society for bringing award-winning pianist and humanitarian Mahani Teave to the University of Hawaii at Hilo Performing Arts Center for an evening of inspiring and uplifting music.The mix of classical piano favorites, including Chopin and Liszt, along with ancestral chants and contemporary music of Rapa Nui was pure poetry.Her hands flew across the keyboard as light, fast and colorful as butterfly wings to produce waves of amazing, fluid magic.If the wind, rain and sea could play the piano, this is surely how it would sound.Sylvia DahlbyHiloAsk politiciansfor ceasefiresEndless wars.We must end the climate-changing, carbon-intensive horrors of wars.Demand of Sens.

eugeneweekly_2023_6,"We ve got issues. Since Hamas’ terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, we’ve seen bigots and extremists exploit the crisis to spread hate, disinformation and extremism. This is a moment of deep Jewish pain, mourning the lives taken and praying for the safe release of the hostages in Gaza — and this pain and fear is compounded by a horrific rise in antisemitism here in the United States and around the globe. We also know that we are not the only ones being targeted in this moment. Our Muslim, Arab and Palestinian American neighbors are facing bigotry, threats and violence — including the despicable murder of a six year old boy this weekend outside Chicago, by a man who reportedly espoused anti-Muslim hate. Let us be unequivocally clear: The Jewish community rejects Islamophobia, anti-Arab hate, antisemitism and all forms of bigotry. Particularly as extremists continue to exploit this moment, we are reminded that all of our communities’ safety and futures are inextricably linked — and recommit ourselves to fighting hate in all its forms. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. We stand in solidarity with all our neighbors under threat, and urge our elected and civic leaders, law enforcement, schools and universities, and employers to make clear there will be zero tolerance for any act of hate."
suffolknewsherald_2023_95,"Published 6:58 pm Friday, March 17, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardEvery year around this time — and again in the fall — we complain about the antiquated practice of moving the clock ahead or backward because, well, we’ve always done it that way.Actually, not always. The person credited with the idea to “spring forward” and “fall back” depends on which history you choose to believe. In 1895, New Zealand entomologist George Hudson proposed daylight saving time because he wanted additional daylight hours to collect insects. Ten years later, tired of having to cut his golf round short at dusk, William Willett, an English builder and outdoorsman who also noticed that many Londoners slept through a large chunk of summer days, suggested moving the clock forward an hour in the spring.The U.S. adopted daylight saving time in 1918, and while many countries abandoned the practice after the first World War, it became common again during World War II and the 1970s energy crisis. But how relevant is daylight saving time in current times?In addition to disrupting sleep patterns, studies have shown that the risk of having a stroke goes up 8% during the first two days after the beginning of DST and the chance of suffering a heart attack rises 24% the Monday after the change to DST.Daylight saving time is also costly. According to a 2017 study in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, associated costs for the time change is $275 million annually and roughly 30 people die each year as a result of the time change.According to a recent report in The Hill, two states — Hawaii and most of Arizona — observe permanent standard time, meaning they don’t change their clocks at all. Instead, they change time zones: Arizona shifted from Mountain Time to Pacific Time when the rest of us moved the clocks forward, and Hawaii moved from six hours behind Eastern Time to five hours behind.At least 19 states have enacted legislation or resolutions to stay on daylight saving time permanently, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But these states can’t make the change without congressional approval, or their neighboring states enacting similar legislation, The Hill reports.Interestingly, Virginia isn’t among them. The state Senate this year defeated a bill to add us to the list of states wanting to keep the time the same year-round.We accept that abolishment of time changes shouldn’t be patchwork. Imagine the confusion, for example, if Suffolk was an hour behind or ahead of Gates County, or the Outer Banks, for that matter.The change should happen at the federal level. Here’s hoping Congress, which has dodged the issue to date, comes around and puts an end to the nonsense of moving the clock ahead and behind an hour — a practice that is no longer practical.Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

eugeneweekly_2023_66,"We ve got issues. You might’ve made New Year’s resolutions last weekend, outlining your personal goals for 2023. Research would indicate that many of us have resolved to improve our health and connections in the year ahead. Unfortunately, few of us have an actual plan for how to do that. For most, the difference between setting goals and meeting goals comes down to structure and habit. Writing down goals is the first step toward externalizing an internal aspiration — it’s the same process that organizations go through when composing a mission statement. At City Club of Eugene, we spend a lot of time thinking about the many missions of this community, and about the importance of shared facts and civil discourse. Our mission is to create the space for open inquiry and learning, which is how shared vision comes into focus. And now, more than ever, local journalism is crucial to this endeavor. Journalists are watchdogs, skeptics and fact-finders. They provide a foundation of understanding that shapes community vision. The First Amendment specifies freedom of the press because journalists act as guardians of democracy and of a society rooted in open inquiry — the heart of City Club’s mission. Local journalists sit through those five-hour public meetings. They gather our divergent, ardent opinions. They have a responsibility to hold public officials’ feet to the fire. Most of us rely on journalists to understand current events and the workings of powerful institutions. Critically, local journalists help us to see the story beyond the narratives. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Writer Rebecca Solnit once described journalists as public storytellers with a duty to “break the story” — and she meant both meanings of the word. Local journalists help us to connect the dots and to face realities we’d rather ignore. Before being celebrated, award-winning journalism is usually “disturbing” and “explosive” — that’s how it feels when something interrupts the status quo. Which makes me think of our tenacious weekly. For these reasons and more, City Club of Eugene is proud to feature the role of local journalism and tohonor the 40th anniversary ofEugene Weeklyduring our first program of 2023. Join us noon Friday, Jan. 6, at the 5th Street Public Market for this program. It will rebroadcast on KLCC 89.7 PM at 7 pm Monday, Jan. 9. FromEW’s originalWhat’s Happeningto the news of this very week, we’ll talk about what makes theWeeklyan essential component of our local community and the challenges and opportunities that journalists currently face right here in Oregon. During its four decades in print,EWhas evolved from an arts and entertainment zine to a weekly known for longer-format reporting, award-winning criticism, guest columns like this one, and enough first-person irreverence and sub-pop A&E to maintain its alternative bona fides. Every seven days, theWeeklycompletes what can be a thankless task: It holds up a mirror to “our issues” while still maintaining a prideful affinity for the evolving people, places, and ideas that make our story unique. EWhas a long history of accomplished editors and writers who have worked two decades under the steadfast guidance of publisher Anita Johnson and a group of hard-working visionaries, past and present, that include the paper’s four founders: Elizabeth Lyman, Lucia McKelvey, Sonja Ungemach and Lois Wadsworth. While the pandemic hurt theWeekly’s revenues, the paper has not stopped looking toward new opportunities, such as collaborating with other alt weeklies, launching a public affairs series and expanding its digital opinion page to accommodateThe Register-Guard’s emigrant grumps. Eugene Weeklyisn’t alone; we have several sources of local news. Eugene is far from a “news desert,” but we do face periods of drought. The challenges we face in 2023 are real, and the role of local journalists — investigative storytellers who actually know the characters — is critical. While corporate entertainment-media prey on partisanship and social media algorithms concentrate bias, local journalism can offer refreshing clarity amidst fracturing public awareness. It’s from shared understanding that we can work toward a shared future. Join us in celebrating theWeekly’s ubiquitous red boxes as a defining fixture of this community, and in making space for questions and dialogue. Kaarin Knudson, AIA, is president of the City Club of Eugene, in addition to her work in housing and sustainable urban design. “CelebratingEugene Weeklyat 40: The Past, Present and Future of Local Journalism” will be at the City Club of Eugene noon Friday, Jan. 6.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_193,"As President Joe Biden looks to boost his reelection campaign and lousy poll numbers, there’s one policy position that is popular with voters, could help unite Democrats and would leave Republicans scrambling to respond. It’s time he come out in support of legalizing recreational use of marijuana.There’s even a ready-made playbook for rolling out the new position. In 2012, then-Vice President Biden provided the initial public push that helped President Barack Obama off the fence on the issue of marriage equality — whose views changed and evolved over two decades, like much of America.Now, it’s Biden stuck straddling the middle when his party and public opinion have already decided the issue. According to the latest Gallup poll earlier this month 70% of Americans think the use of marijuana should be legal. At the same time, 24 states have moved forward on their own and legalized recreational use, the latest being Ohio where voters approved a ballot measure last week. According to Politico, more than half the country’s adult population lives somewhere weed is legal so it seems clear that this is an issues Democrats could embrace with little worry of a backlash.What’s more, Vice President Kamala Harris could take the first step — much as Biden did for Obama on marriage equality.For a long time, it made sense for Biden to lag behind public opinion on this issue, even if it promised short-term positive publicity. Presidents polarize. Had Biden run on legalization in 2020, or moved strongly toward it early in his presidency, he would have risked hardening opposition among Republicans. It also would have hurt the prospects for change and canceled out any public opinion advantages. It made more sense for him to oppose legalization as a candidate in 2020, and have taken only modest steps in that direction as president.Moreover, it’s an issue that unites Democrats. The Gallup survey found a whopping 87% of all Democrats support legalization, while Republicans are split with 55% supporting legalization and 45% opposed. No single policy position will decide an election, but on the margins taking the popular side of a 70/30 issue that splits the other party is certainly a net plus with voters. And a lot of elections are decided on the margins.Meanwhile, anything that raises the salience of legalization creates tension among Republicans. Organized groups within the party still oppose marijuana, but the issue is popular with many GOP voters.Having Harris make the first step makes sense for multiple reasons. As both a former prosecutor and a criminal justice reformer, her own record on marijuana is complicated, but she’s supported legalization in the past. For her to take a strong step now, perhaps just by saying what she thinks Biden should do, could help solidify her position as a reformer. If Biden then follows her lead, it would demonstrate her real influence within the administration — something all vice presidents try to do. As for Biden, those who care about the issue will only care where he ends up, not how he got there.We can’t know exactly how many votes a strong pro-legalization position would net for Democrats in 2024. But adopting a popular position that unites the party and divides Republicans can only help."
suffolknewsherald_2023_113,"Published 5:55 pm Tuesday, November 7, 2023ByJen JaquaThe paper has changed greatly over the past 150 years, and the most recent 20 are no exception. With the increased use of the internet, the News-Herald has changed how we make and distribute the news.In July of 2007, the entire print paper got an overhaul in both looks and content. A few of the changes made included a focused look at North Suffolk news each edition. A new design was implemented that was easier to read and created opportunities for more local news and photos. Also included in the overhaul was a price drop from $1 on Sunday and 50 cents during the week to 25 cents every day.On April 28, 2008, Suffolk was hit with a powerful tornado. The next day’s front page provided a look at the devastation. There were no fatalities in Suffolk, said city and police officials. There was a death during the storm, but it was not a result of, or connected to, the tornado. About 120 people with injuries were transported to medical facilities in the region, said Dana Woodson, spokeswoman for the city. Some 3,200 customers were without power in the city. Buildings were flattened in Burnett’s Mill and Hillpoint Farms, as well as a few on Murphy’s Mill Road and about eight buildings in Driver. Countless vehicles had their twisted metal bodies strewn about the Route 10 corridor.In March of 2009 the News-Herald joined the growing masses on Facebook and Twitter. We continue to use these social media platforms to distribute the news quickly and effectively.At the end of 2009, Suffolk Publications, the parent company of the Suffolk News-Herald, launched Suffolk Living, a quarterly, full-color magazine aimed at spotlighting the “people, places and things that make Suffolk such a wonderful place.”On July 5, 2011, the front page declared “Let FREEdom Ring.” The News-Herald dropped the subscription price and became free at newstands around the city. “We want to make community news available to every citizen, regardless of ability to pay,” Editor Res Spears said.In August 2018, amid rising costs in the paper that is used to print the News-Herald, the decision was made to drop the Saturday publication. In 2020, with further rises in printing costs coupled with the strains of COVID, publication dropped to two days a week.In the early morning hours of August 4, 2020, a tornado spawned from tropical storm Isaias ripped through the Suffolk downtown area. Included in the damages was the Saratoga Street Suffolk News-Herald building. Following the damage of the tornado, the News-Herald moved into an office building on Main Street across from the courthouse.This past Oct. 1, we made the move to publish once a week while providing daily news online.Although much has changed through the years, the Suffolk News-Herald is your source of Suffolk news as it has been for 150 years.I hope you enjoyed the journey through the decades this past year.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_50,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°It’s not officially over yet, but the United Auto Workers appear to have won a significant victory. The union, which began rolling strikes on Sept. 15, now has tentative agreements with Ford, Stellantis (which I still think of as Chrysler and, finally, General Motors.All three agreements involve a roughly 25% wage increase over the next 4 1/2 years, plus other significant concessions. Autoworkers are a much smaller share of the workforce than they were in Detroit’s heyday, but they’re still a significant part of the economy.Furthermore, this apparent union victory follows on significant organized-labor wins in other industries in recent months, notably a big settlement with United Parcel Service, where the Teamsters represent more than 300,000 employees.And maybe, just maybe, union victories in 2023 will prove to be a milestone on the way back to a less unequal nation.Some history you should know: Baby boomers like me grew up in a nation that was far less polarized economically than the one we live in today. We weren’t as much of a middle-class society as we liked to imagine, but in the 1960s we were a country in which many blue-collar workers had incomes they considered middle class, while extremes of wealth were far less than they have since become. For example, CEOs of major corporations were paid “only” 15 times as much as their average workers, compared with more than 200 times as much as their average workers now.Most people, I suspect, believed — if they thought about it at all — that a relatively middle-class society had evolved gradually from the excesses of the Gilded Age, and that it was the natural end state of a mature market economy.However, a revelatory 1991 paper by Claudia Goldin (who just won a richly deserved Nobel and Robert Margo showed that a relatively equal America emerged not gradually but suddenly, with an abrupt narrowing of income differentials in the 1940s — what the authors called the Great Compression. The initial compression no doubt had a lot to do with wartime economic controls. But income gaps remained narrow for decades after these controls were lifted; overall income inequality didn’t really take off again until around 1980.Why did a fairly flat income distribution persist? No doubt there were multiple reasons, but surely one important factor was that the combination of war and a favorable political environment led to a huge surge in unionization. Unions are a force for greater wage equality; they also help enforce the “outrage constraint” that used to limit executive compensation.Conversely, the decline of unions, which now represent less than 7% of private-sector workers, must have played a role in the coming of the Second Gilded Age we live in now.The great decline of unions wasn’t a necessary consequence of globalization and technological progress. Unions remain strong in some nations; in Scandinavia, the great majority of workers are still union members.What happened in America was that workers’ bargaining power was held back by the combination of a persistently slack labor market, with sluggish recoveries from recessions and an unfavorable political environment — let’s not forget that early in his presidency, Ronald Reagan crushed the air traffic controllers’ union, and his administration was consistently hostile to union organizing.But this time is different. Research by David Autor, Arindrajit Dube and Annie McGrew shows that a rapid recovery that has brought unemployment near to a 50-year low seems to have empowered lower-wage workers, producing an “unexpected compression” in wage gaps that has eliminated around a quarter of the rise in inequality over the previous four decades.The strong job market has probably encouraged unions to stake out more aggressive bargaining positions, a stance that so far seems to be working.By the way, I constantly encounter people who believe that the recent economic recovery has disproportionately benefited the affluent. The truth is exactly the opposite.The political ground also seems to be shifting. Public approval of unions is at its highest point since 1965, and Joe Biden, in a presidential first, joined an autoworker picket line in Michigan in September to show support.None of what’s happening now seems remotely big enough to produce a second Great Compression. It might, however, be enough to produce a Lesser Compression — a partial reversal of the great rise in inequality since 1980.Of course, this doesn’t have to happen. A recession could undermine workers’ bargaining power.If Donald Trump, who also visited Michigan but spoke at a nonunion shop, returns to the White House, you can be sure that his policies will be anti-union and anti-worker. And Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, has an almost perfect record of opposing policies supported by unions.So the future is, as always, uncertain. But we might, just might, be seeing America finally turn back toward the kind of widely shared prosperity we used to take for granted.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2023_37,"Sexualityis confusing. The journey is lifelong and sometimes perilous. Sexual desire is a primal instinct, and the ability to bloom into who you are sexually is an integral part of good mental health. In that transformation, there is confusion and sometimes heartbreak. It’s important that we acknowledge this yet continue to grow into who we are intended to be.I did not have many boyfriends in high school but had some great relationships and crushes with some wonderful boys. I was passionate about my close friendships and found myself in love with the souls close to me, whether male or female.My struggle was that I had several experiences with adults and other kids that confused me and left me questioning boundaries, what a woman really is, and my own desires. I don’t remember any openly gay people in my adolescence, but I do know that sexual play between adolescents of the same sex is common and normal. Boys and girls explore their bodies with both sexes. It is a human fact.When I went to college at WKU, I met people from all over and started to find my tribe. It was here that I found David and a crew from Louisville that became lifelong friends. We shared the freedom to grow outside the rules of our parents. We were finally free to do what we wanted — and we did wholeheartedly.David and I hit it off right away. We could not help smiling at each other and locking eyes whenever we were together. We were expressive with wicked senses of humor that fit together in a way I had not experienced. We simply clicked, and soon found ourselves inseparable.In my gut, I thought David was gay from day one. I asked my friends that knew him if he was, and they said that he loved women. He did not hesitate to touch me, showing his love for me daily, and we got to know one another and each other’s families.It was a beautiful college experience. We were in a state of love that felt almost symbiotic but something was off.David and I talked about a future together, what we wanted and how our lives would be together beyond college. It was my first serious and, I thought, mature relationship. It felt organic but there was no sex. Neither of us had enough experience to truly understand who we were sexually nor the earthquake his realization would cause for the both of us.I began to worry about the lack of sexual play between us and shared my feelings with David. He was on a different journey, and going through something primal and extremely confusing. We were both lost.He confused me with the love he shared for me, and everything in me had fallen for him — and who we were together — but we were in limbo.The wick was lit and the powderkeg was ready to blow. Something had to change.One day the tension got the best of us and he finally shared that he loved me more than anything but that he had no sexual feelings towards me.I heard him, yet internalized that I was disgusting and was simply unlovable despite him never saying this. Every body image issue I had bubbled to the surface. We clumsily tried our best not to hurt one another with the limited understanding of who we were becoming. David was in pain and needed more from me than I was able to give.He spent a weekend in Nashville and understood his true identity as a gay man. Looking back, I feel that I failed him because I could not ignore my own needs to be the friend he needed. He called me, angry that I was not there for him at a crucial and desperate time. He wanted his friend and soulmate to be with him through this awakening.I was heartbroken, and yelled back that his life was not my responsibility. I was devastated and resorted to the only coping mechanism I had at the time, flight.I transferred to UofL and did not look back. I felt lonely. I did not look for love anymore and resigned myself to a lifestyle of no commitments.David moved on with a life of travels and exploration. We both graduated college and kept up through friends, but left one another to heal.In the years that followed, I would run into him from time to time, and the sting was still there. We did not know how to act around each other but there was still love even in the distance. We were simply on different paths.If I were meant for David, or him for me, we would have been together. David could not be with me in the way that I desired a man. Even though it hurt, his need to be himself was a life or death situation. Still, our relationship changed us both forever.We are both married now and share the occasional, “Howdy,” on . He is happy and has the love he has always deserved, and so do I. My heart is full for him. That sting is gone for us both.For this Pride celebration, let’s all be gentle with one another as we are all here to give and receive love as the highest form of being human. We are in this life together even if our paths diverge sometimes. We are ONE.•*** ."
eugeneweekly_2023_31,"We ve got issues. After three years of responding to crises like the pandemic and wildfires, Oregon’s 2023 legislative session was an important opportunity for lawmakers to re-group and act on critical issues facing our state. This session was not without its challenges, including a six-week Republican walkout, but I’m proud of how we got things back on track and passed legislation that will make a real difference in the lives of Oregonians. Heading into the session, the Oregon House Democrats created a policy agenda, “Rebuilding for the Future,” that outlined a path to address the issues most important to Oregonians, including housing and homelessness, behavioral health and addiction treatment, stronger schools, climate change, community safety, reproductive rights and strengthening our democracy. Among the many policies and budgets passed this session, here are a few highlights. Oregon’s lack of housing is driving the homelessness crisis and making housing unaffordable for too many working families. The bipartisan Affordable Housing & Emergency Homelessness Response package was the first major piece of legislation we passed — we then finished the session with a long list of additional housing policies and investments. These investments, including $15 million for shelter and services in Lane County, will help get people off the streets, connected to services and on the path out of homelessness. We also addressed the root causes of homelessness by funding eviction prevention work and youth homelessness programs as well as prioritizing significant increases in housing production across the state. This session we improved our behavioral health system through investments to increase the number of treatment facilities, including $5 million to Lane County to fund a behavioral health stabilization center, and expand our behavioral health workforce. We also passed a lifesaving Opioid Harm Reduction Package, and made sure the 9-8-8 Suicide Prevention & Behavioral Health Crisis Line has stable funding to help Oregonians in crisis. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Climate-fueled extreme heat, drought and wildfires are threatening our way of life. The Climate Resilience Package passed this session will increase our energy efficiency and build a more resilient energy system. The package will leverage federal funding to create jobs, protect Oregonians from extreme weather and drive down household energy costs for working families. One of the most important duties the Legislature has is ensuring that our K-12 schools have stable and sufficient funding. Democrats delivered on that responsibility by funding the State School Fund at $10.2 billion, a 10 percent increase over the last budget cycle. We also focused on supporting the state’s educator workforce, and we passed the Early Literacy Initiative to ensure our schools have what they need to teach students to read in evidence-based ways. To make our communities safer, we banned ghost guns — untraceable and undetectable firearms often used by gun traffickers or people legally prohibited from buying firearms. We invested in community-based violence prevention efforts that serve victims of violence and work to reduce future crime, arrests, and emergency room visits. We also protected our constitutional right to representation by making significant reforms to our state’s public defense system. To support working families, we passed Oregon’s first-ever child tax credit. Child tax credits are a proven way to reduce poverty and bring stability to families, and this $1,000-per-child credit will put money into the hands of struggling families for essentials like groceries and rent. After the Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wade, Democrats committed to protecting and expanding access to abortion in our state. We delivered on that promise by passing the Reproductive Health & Access to Care Act, which will ensure people in Oregon maintain the rights we had underRoe, protect Oregon medical providers and clinics that provide abortion care, and close insurance gaps, including for gender-affirming care. At a time when our institutions are under attack and trust in government is waning, Democrats stood up for democracy. As Chair of the House Rules Committee, I shepherded a policy agenda through the legislature focused on ensuring free and fair elections, expanding access to the ballot, and instituting key ethics and accountability reforms in government. We asked voters to approve two constitutional amendments: one to create an independent Salary Commission so politicians can’t increase their own salaries, and a second to establish an impeachment process for executive branch elected officials, creating a new tool to hold politicians accountable. Despite Senate Republicans’ attempts to shut down our government and block all progress, Democrats stayed the course and delivered. What we achieved this session will make Oregon a better place to live, work, and raise a family in the years to come."

philinquirer_2023_14,"The transition away from fossil fuels is an urgent necessity, but we must ensure that renewable energy development doesn t leave anyone behind. On Tuesday, the offshore wind developer Orsted announced that it had decided toscrap both of its New Jersey projects, citing rising interest rates and supply-chain problems. The projects, combined, would have poweredover 1.6 million homesand were part of Gov. Phil Murphy’s plan toaddress climate change. But this setback is by no means the end of renewable energy in the Garden State. In order to ensure a full and just transition to clean energy technologies, New Jersey must continue to prioritize the economic stability and well-being of communities that have been historically sidelined from the benefits of energy development. Job training is among the most important outcomes of any potential renewable energy project. Our organization, the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance, works with communities that have been disproportionately exposed to and negatively impacted by hazardous pollution and industrial practices. This includes Newark, Camden, Edison, and Bayonne, which are close to waste incinerators, power plants,Superfund sites, and other highly toxic sources of pollution. In June, we joined the first cohort of community-facing organizations to receive workforce development grants as part of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority’soffshore wind initiative. We worked to help inform the process of introducing offshore wind in a manner that centered, or at least included, communities that are currently hosting power plants and refineries. These communities have been historically cut out of important conversations and initiatives like this one. Within these meetings, we as an environmental justice organization worked to reframe the conversation around the immediate needs and risks of overburdened communities. These projects were one avenue for ensuring that New Jersey residents traditionally impacted by toxicity and pollution were no longer just the victims of bad policy, but active participants and the protagonists in thestory of what comes next. In the pursuit of ajust transitionaway from fossil fuels, we must continue to ensure that the transition to clean energy does not leave people behind. As made visible by theNew Jersey Environmental Justice Mapping, Assessment, and Protection Tool, areas such as Newark, Camden, Edison, and Bayonne are among the overburdened communities consistently at risk. The question of economics weighs heavily for environmental justice advocates as we seek to work with allies and state agencies to bring clean technologies to our state, while simultaneously ensuring that we do not replicate the current systems of economic imbalance. We cannot and must not sacrifice the economic stability of our environmental justice communities while we develop long-term green technology options. When picturingoffshore wind, cities like Newark, Elizabeth, Rahway, and Camden may not immediately come to mind. However, these cities are either thesitesof health-harming energy infrastructure, polluting ports, or both. These same communities, and others like them, have borne the burdens of keeping the state and the region running without seeing many benefits. Understanding that the prospect of mega wind farms off the coast presented challenges, specifically tosome of the communities at the Shore, we knew it would be doing fossil energy-impacted communities a disservice if we did not enter into the conversation. Offshore wind is never going to be a singular, all-encompassing solution, but it does provide environmental justice communities an opportunity to be active participants in building safer, healthier, and more sustainable communities. Offshore wind offers not only a greener, cleaner technology than fossil fuels but also the potential forjob investmentin communities that have historically faced economic disadvantages and financial hardships. Orsted’s announcement this week came not only as a surprise but as a disappointment. As the Murphy administration considers other renewable energy projects, it is imperative that state leaders are intentional about equally distributing both the benefits and risks of transitioning to new technologies. The transition away from fossil fuels is an urgent necessity, but we must ensure that the choices we make today — which will continue to impact future generations — are ones that don’t leave anyone behind. One solution is not going to fix climate change. One setback won’t stop climate action, either. Melissa Miles is the executive director of the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance. Brooke Helmick is the law and policy manager of the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance."
suffolknewsherald_2023_56,"Published 4:32 pm Tuesday, May 2, 2023ByJen JaquaThe topic of school integration continued through 1956. In the first week of January, several stories covered the front page regarding the “Gray plan.” The Gray plan was the name for the proposed amendment that would permit the state to issue tuition grants to students for attendance at private, nonsectarian schools rather than integrated public schools.Racial integration debates and arguments spread from schools to churches. One such story detailing the heated discussions in the Methodist church stated “The conflict resurrected shadows of century-old lines that once divided the church, North and South.” Another minister was quoted as saying, “I pray to God that this racial flag will be brought down, that we will march on as one army of the living God under the banner of Jesus Christ.”Front-page stories over the next several months would highlight the same discussion in every house of worship in the city.Other discussions of policy change in the Lutheran church revolved around the remarriage of divorced people. The church wiped out its arbitrary restrictions against second marriages and ushered in a new policy to gauge each case by broader principles. Divorce violates God’s law, the pronouncement said, but God forgives lawbreakers if they repent. “If God forgives, we also should forgive,” declared Dr. Martin J. Heinecken of Lutheran Theological Seminary, Philadelphia, in supporting the less stringent approach to remarriage.While schools at every level wrestled with integration, the State Board of Higher Education was created to help coordinate events and activities between state colleges as well as to avoid duplication of efforts in the curriculum.Nationally, technology made significant breakthroughs, often for use in war or the prevention of war.An electronic brain was made a key part of the plan for spotting enemy attacks. A complex system called SAGE, semi automatic ground environment, was in the prototype phase. This system used computing machines, radar and communication equipment working together to automatically and almost instantaneously provide information needed for waging air battles.While the Salk vaccine for polio was determined to be 85% effective and made readily available to combat the polio epidemic, another disease plagued Suffolk.Measles season produced an epidemic in Suffolk with more than 400 cases. Absenteeism from elementary schools was at double its normal level. According to one doctor, measles returns to an area in force every 2-3 years. This occurs when a new group of children, not immunized by exposure, comes along to catch and spread the disease.Mrs. Harrison Butler was celebrated in March for turning 100. “A sprightly little lady with freshly-permanente white curls bustled about her Chestnut Street rooms with the spirit of a girl celebrating her ‘‘sweet sixteen’ birthday.”Comparing life then with when she was a girl, Mrs. Butler implied that people are losing the art of communication. “We used to sit on the porch at night, embroidering and talking. Today,’’ she said, “people go too much and they go too fast. They talk on the phone though. They talk too much then. They go on for an hour at a time and you can’t even use the phone yourself.’’Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

Hugs to Kendra, Melissa, Mary, Kimberly, Cynetra, Lavone, Millicent, Angelique and every other mother who feels some kind of way every single morning that your child heads off to school. We finally made it to senior year. The Class of 2024 is our kids.It’s hard to believe that September 2010 was actually 13 years ago. My daughter was so excited to start Pre-K. I remember her walking around Mrs. Karen Branson’s classroom at Oakland Elemantary School looking for her name plate on her desk during open house. I was slightly distracted trying to keep my eyes on Jenesis as Mrs. Branson gave me the parent scoop. She paused midsentence to ask, “Is she your oldest child?” I answered “Yes” affirming her suspicion. I was so ready for her to grow up but I wanted to watch every moment. Once school doors accept our young, we wait after the school bells ring to hear of the daily memories that we once witnessed day by day.It all seems like a blur. I am silently looking for someone to blame because the days and months were authorized to move forward before I finished preparations for this last year of high school. Pictures of kindergarden, 3rd grade, 5th grade, 8th grade and so on confirm that the days have actually taken place and there are changes to that once little smiling face. It hit me just the other day as I was staring back at her senior formal photo looking back at me, “Wow, she is looking like a senior!” I said it outloud before I even realized it. I’m still keeping my eyes on her while she is figuring out where she belongs. Only this time it’s not as easy as Mrs. Branson made it by putting our children’s names on their desks. Over the next few months, the Class of 2024 will be figuring it out for themselves. Which university will open its doors to them and they accept?Just the other day the words to an old country song by singer, Willie Nelson ran across my mind as I thought about my daughter growing up. The lyrics said, “Mommas don’t let your babies grow up to be cowboys.” I grew up in the southern Georgia and we loved country music. I still do. I used to sing this song swaying side to side, arm and arm with my sisters or classmates when we are joking around in school. I smiled to myself because it was a good memory.Mothers always get a bad rap for not allowing our children to grow up. We are also accused of not allowing them to make decisions for themselves and for not giving them freedom to do what they want to do. We are told that we hold on too tightly. We are told to just let them be.As the Class of 2024 embarks on this journey of choosing the next location that will have a desk with their names on it, I wish to say to mothers “Mammas don’t let your babies BE afraid.” A mothers oversight is sometimes misinterpreted as fear for her young. Let your son or daughter, see you watching them intently with smiles of assurance and winks. Let them know that you are so proud that you have had a front row seat to their every milestone and it has been a beautiful motion picture to watch. Encourage your senior not to miss their shot and take every opportunity they have to put their name in the hat. Make sure they know that they should NEVER disqualify himself or herself no matter what the naysayers and haters believe about them. Our children will believe in themselves because they will always have Mamma’s voice in their ears.. Make sure your high school senior documents memories this year and that they make good choices.. Above all else, Mammas be sure to be the loudest cheerleader on the sidelines. Don’t apologize for it. You can’t stop them from growing up. So, you won’t stop me for cheering along the way.Congratulations to all the parents and the Suffolk Education Community who are preparing the Class of 2024 to graduate. It is an exciting year.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_150,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Sign needed atfree legal serviceSign needed atfree legal serviceHawaii County has a self-help, no-charge legal guidance service offered every Tuesday at midday for a hour and a half at the Judiciary building in Hilo.I went Tuesday and have a suggestion for the people who are responsible for this program: For God’s sake, put up a clearly written and prominently displayed sign with instructions for how to sign in, thereby beginning the process, because there is absolutely nothing like that there. It’s like you have to know, and that is just wrong.I was there, sitting like an idiot, for half an hour before one of my fellow guidance-seekers figured it out and shared it with me.And I watched five more people come after me, all with the same puzzled expression, as in, “Where in the world do I sign in?”Turns out, the one person manning the question booth had clipboards with sign-in forms all over his desk. In between his sessions with guidance-seekers, we were evidently supposed to dart into his office and grab one of these clipboards to fill out our intake information.Tough luck for me that I didn’t know that. I didn’t want to keep darting into his office between clients, because I thought it would be disruptive to his work.Just because some of us don’t have extra cash laying around to plunk down on lawyers does not mean that we should be left to fend for ourselves, or that we are clairvoyant. We pay taxes, too.So, for crying out loud, hire somebody to spend an hour or two making a sign that says where and how to sign in.Meanwhile, I’ll be back there soon, and I will know what to do. That is, unless they hide the sign-in sheets somewhere else next time.Lucky for me, I’m retired, have some time, and my legal questions aren’t life-and-death. Some of the other people had busses to catch or were going to have to go to work with no lunch.Don’t make us grovel.Mary Lee KnapstadVolcanoBe kind duringthe holiday seasonI love this time of the year, as it provides a season where we have holiday cheer in celebration of Thanksgiving and the Christmas Spirit is all around us.I believe that this time of the year is to promote “togetherness” with family, friends and the community. Because we “live aloha” daily, this dedicated time can make life so sweeter.However, please slow things down and breathe. Remember, that our health and safety is of the most importance, and be cautious of the commercial pressure that is everywhere.Counteract the madness of holiday shopping with sleeping in, going to the beach, or some other activity that encourages a mindful and environmental-friendly attitude. If you must go out shopping, plan on crowds and less parking at your favorite store or mall, so leave earlier and give extra time for travel.Smile.

suffolknewsherald_2023_241,"Published 4:57 pm Tuesday, July 18, 2023ByStaff ReportsPart three in a series of threeAs “pilgrims,” both Catholic and non-Catholics, continue to flock and see this mystical or miraculous “incorrupt” body of Sister Wilhelmina Lancaster, that has been on display for weeks, encased in glass at the altar shrine, at the Abbey of Our Lady of Ephesus, investigations by the Catholic Church are ongoing.Like a local mortician who saw the remains intact, these pilgrims from different states were all in awe and disbelief to see for themselves the incorruptible body of Sister Wilhelmina. They prayed for her intercession.Will the Vatican declare her a saint someday? That’s the question we all anticipate. Let’s wait and see.Jenna Marie Cooper of “Our Sunday Visitor News” explained that a saint is “incorrupt” when, years after their death, their mortal body is found to have remained in an unexplained state of preservation. That is, their body has not followed the expected natural process of decomposition.Cooper, a licentiate in canon law and an OSV weekly columnist, wrote that for a saint to be considered incorrupt, their body must not have been subjected to any deliberate artificial embalming process. Sister Wlhelmina’s body was not embalmed before her burial, which was two days after her death, according to Benedictine Sisters.“It’s true that part of the canonization process involves exhuming the body of the proposed saint (essentially as a way of verifying their identity , but in the canonization process, the state of the person’s mortal remains is of minimal relevance,” she wrote.Other factors for the church to declare someone a saint include miracles attributed to the proposed saint and how the proposed saint has lived her/his life, i.e, did she live a life of holiness and heroic Christian virtue?Cooper further said that when a deceased member of the faithful is found to be incorrupt, this can serve as a strong reminder to us of our belief in the “resurrection of the body,” which we profess when we pray the Apostles Creed.She quoted lines from the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 997, which states: “In death, the separation of the soul from the body, the human body decays and the soul goes to meet God, while awaiting its reunion with the glorified body.

If you skip over to Annenberg Hall — the “Berg” to those in the know — you’ll land “Corn Niblets” and “Apple Cider Glazed Turnips,” so “Delish,” food services says.It’s easier to critique others when your belly is full.How else can you explain the grossly insensitive statement by the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups that read, in part: “We, the undersigned student organizations, hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all the unfolding violence.” Thirty-one groups signed on, including the Ivy League’s affiliate of Amnesty International.The timing alone is unforgivable. Hamas terrorists have taken hostages and are threatening to execute them one at a time. Children, women and the elderly are part of this Medieval equation.The atrocities that have already taken place could be even worse in the days to come. The Harvard elitists blaming Israel are just emboldening Hamas terrorists. What’s unfolding in the Gaza Strip and in Israel is war, not fodder for a term paper or a photo op.U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton was right to blast the Harvard students who now look heartless and crass.“Terrorism is never justified nor someone else’s fault. As hundreds of Israelis and others, including several Americans, remain kidnapped, injured, or dead, the 31 Harvard organizations that signed a letter holding Israel ‘entirely responsible’ for Hamas’ barbarous terrorism should be condemned, as should Harvard leadership for whom silence is complicity,” he wrote in a release Monday evening.Harvard President Claudine Gay waited until Tuesday to respond with a three-paragraph statement: “As the events of recent days continue to reverberate, let there be no doubt that I condemn the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas. Such inhumanity is abhorrent, whatever one’s individual views of the origins of longstanding conflicts in the region,” she said.“Let me also state, on this matter as on others, that while our students have the right to speak for themselves, no student group — not even 30 student groups — speaks for Harvard University or its leadership.“We will all be well served in such a difficult moment by rhetoric that aims to illuminate and not inflame. And I appeal to all of us in this community of learning to keep this in mind as our conversations continue,” she concluded.It’s embarrassing to be in the same state as Harvard today. Another group at the Cambridge college is standing tall.Harvard Hillel, in its statement, wrote members are “deeply pained that instead of finding solace and support among our Harvard community in the days following the bloodiest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, we encountered further hatred and anti-Semitism here in Cambridge.”Skip the Apple Cider Glazed Turnips, kids. History will remember this moment and how Harvard did or did not rise to the occasion.

suffolknewsherald_2023_216,"Published 6:40 pm Tuesday, December 12, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardThe holiday season is synonymous with joy and celebration, but safety should always be a top priority amid the festivities — especially regarding fire hazards. Adopting crucial fire safety measures for your home during this festive time is not just a responsible choice; it’s necessary to ensure everyone a safe and happy holiday season.Candles can add a warm and cozy ambiance to your holiday décor but pose a potential fire risk. Remember the golden rule when incorporating candles into your festive arrangements: keep them at least 3 feet away from anything flammable. Whether nestled among tinsel or gracing your dining table, ensure a safe distance to prevent accidental fires. Never leave candles unattended, as disaster only takes a moment to strike.Festive decorations enhance the holiday spirit, but their placement requires careful consideration. Ensure that decorations are strategically placed away from heat sources and flammable materials. This includes keeping curtains, Christmas trees, and other embellishments safe from areas prone to fire risks. By doing so, you can enjoy the beauty of your decorations without compromising safety.The kitchen becomes a bustling hub of activity during the holidays, preparing dinners and treats. Exercise caution while cooking, and never leave stovetops unattended. Keep flammable items well away from heat sources to minimize the risk of kitchen fires. Maintaining a vigilant eye in the kitchen contributes to a safer environment for everyone in your home.For those opting for a live Christmas tree, keeping it hydrated throughout the season is essential. A well-hydrated tree is less likely to become a fire hazard. Also, remove the tree from heat sources such as radiators and fireplaces. When leaving home or heading to bed, switch the tree lights off. Taking these precautions not only preserves the life of your tree but also reduces the risk of fire incidents.Your home’s safety net during the holidays — and beyond — is your smoke alarms. Regularly confirm that they are in working order by conducting tests. Don’t forget to replace batteries as needed to guarantee they function correctly. A properly functioning smoke alarm is your earliest detection system in a fire emergency, providing precious moments to react and mitigate potential damage.By incorporating these essential fire safety measures into your holiday preparations, you not only elevate the festive spirit but also ensure a safe Christmas season. Prioritizing safety allows you to cherish the holiday moments with peace of mind, knowing that you’ve taken the necessary steps to protect your home and loved ones from fire hazards.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_107,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Celebrating the true discoverersCelebrating the true discoverersToday, most of the nation observes Columbus Day or Discoverers’ Day.Explorers such as Christopher Columbus or Ferdinand Magellan are celebrated. Here in Hawaii, however, it takes on a very different aspect. I believe the late renowned artist and historian Herb Kane put it best when he stated:“So it was that while other men sailed within the comforting presence of continental coasts, always knowing the way to a large land mass, Polynesians faced the open sea without fear as their own and only world. Before European open ocean exploration began, they and their descendants had discovered every habitable island within an area of ocean greater than the size of North and South America combined — a Neolithic feat which must rank forever as one of man’s greatest achievements.”Written history is full of famous “discoverers” who ventured off to find far lands that already had people living in them. Who then were the true discoverers of Hawaii?Sometime in the distant past, perhaps between 300 AD and 600 AD, one or more Polynesian double-hulled canoes ventured north from what are now the Marquesas Islands and became the first humans to discover the verdant volcanic islands of Hawaii.It is likely they first settled in the fertile well-watered valleys of the windward sides where cultivation would have been easiest. In the forests, they would have encountered birds and plants unknown to them in their home islands, having evolved here in isolation for millions of years. Although we know little about them, it was these people, not the Europeans nor the later Polynesians, who were the true discoverers of Hawaii.We know that these Polynesian discoverers brought with them cultigens, implements, a language and gods that had been part of their culture for thousands of years throughout their migration eastward out of Southeast Asia into Samoa, Tonga, and finally into the eastern Pacific.Long before Columbus, they had discovered and settled virtually every inhabitable island within the Polynesian triangle that extends from Aotearoa (New Zealand in the west to Rapa Nui (Easter Island in the east to Hawaii in the north. They knew how to navigate these long voyages by reading the stars, wave patterns and signs of nature.In recent years, a revival of these ancient navigation techniques has taken place through the voyages of the Hokule‘a and other Polynesian voyaging canoes, resulting in a greater respect for the abilities of these people.Gordon JoyceCaptain CookNEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

suffolknewsherald_2023_129,"Published 6:02 pm Friday, February 10, 2023ByLetters to the EditorEditor:Instead of being proud of the engaged residents Suffolk is lucky to have, Councilmember Roger Fawcett sees fit to tell people who show up to get involved in their city to “get a life.” Working to change things is a part of many good citizens’ lives, and when he sought to hold public office, listening to those people and working towards making our city a better place to live for everyone should have become part of his too.I was not an eyewitness, but I read the SNH article on Mr. Fawcett’s remarks at the second 2045 Comprehensive Plan community engagement meeting and listened to several reports from those who attended. As one of the organizers of the hundreds of Suffolk residents who sought to stop the rezoning of the Williams Farm property to heavy industrial for the Port 460 project, it is clear to me that his remarks grew out of his frustration and anger that residents were so determined to save the city they love from the bad decision of five city council members that they were able to bring it to Suffolk Circuit Court.While Port 460 opponents were showing up this summer at city council meeting after meeting and taking every opportunity we could to educate our neighbors as well as city council members of the implications of such a rezoning decision, many of us continued to go to our jobs, care for our families, and meet the demands of our daily lives. Fighting City Council wasn’t what we wanted to do over our summer and then into fall, but we did it for all the Suffolkians, current and future, who can recognize a bad thing when they see it.Mr. Fawcett showed his disdain for citizens during that time too, often talking down to them after public hearings and speaker time had ended and belittling the hours of work they put into researching the issues associated with the massive Port 460 proposal, doing the work that clearly he had not done.His recent actions demonstrate that his attitude towards citizens has not changed and he lacks the vision required to lead the development of a visionary plan. His attempts to portray the incident as simply “lively debate” are false; there was no debate, just Mr. Fawcett running his mouth and ruining the bit of progress city staff members had made to improve relationships with the citizens they serve.I agree with Dr. Sherri Johnston, who called for his removal from his position as the chair of the 2045 Comprehensive Plan Steering Committee.

suffolknewsherald_2023_17,"Published 4:47 pm Tuesday, June 20, 2023ByJen JaquaNot all news from the end of the 1960s was turmoil and strife.Suffolk continued to grow and develop. Community members had big dreams.Peoples Drug Store opened at Suffolk Plaza, the second one in Suffolk. The downtown Suffolk store continued on in operation as before. The new store had 15,000 square feet, and was one of the largest of all Peoples Drug Stores at the time.In April 1968, the idea of a mall in downtown Suffolk found favor with merchants interviewed by the News-Herald. As envisioned by these store owners, the mall would extend one block in all four directions from the intersection of Washington and Main Streets. Some wanted to close the four blocks to motor traffic; others would rather have seen only covered walkways. For those wanting an end to motor traffic, the mall should have covered walkways at a minimum with a completely covered downtown area later. The closed mall would have heat and air conditioning as needed. Henry C. Galumbeck, manager of Haynes Furniture Store, commented: “You either have to modernize town or shut up.” Galumbeck wanted to close one block in each direction from the Washington-Main intersection and cover it. “You don’t need traffic. You can’t park, so what good’s traffic?”The newspaper as well was undergoing changes and improvements. In the middle of the changes, the paper won an impressive award for the overall look of the paper. The front-page story highlighted the process of a newspaper in the day. “Although we have won a number of honors previously, this is one in which all News-Herald staff members take considerable pride,” James Boone Jr., editor and publisher, noted. “That is because we totally changed our mechanical procedures in December, requiring complete retraining of all production staff members and major changes in all departments.” Boone continued: “’Makeup’ begins with Ira E. ‘Spike’ Moore in the newsroom. He writes most headlines, and decides on the ‘play’ of most stories. Richard L. Austin backs him up one day a week, when Moore is off. After type is set for stories and headlines, Composing Room Foreman Willie T. Aswell usually puts the pages together. He is backed up and assisted in page makeup by Mrs. Elinor Antis and Mrs. Alma Nance. None of the three had ever done page makeup prior to the first of this year, although Aswell and Mrs. Nance had operated typesetting machines in the former operation. Finally, the best page makeup looks pretty bad without a good print. William C. Moore, press room foreman, provides that along with Lawrence R. Lewis and others. The presses and related equipment they operate were installed late last year, and their first exposure to this type of printing equipment came less than a year ago. Other staff members play key roles. Raleigh T. Piland Jr., who is production manager, assists where needed. So do Robert R. Hardy, who is in charge of daily newsroom operations, and Mrs. Marion Brinkley, women’s editor and a general reporter. Quite a few others likewise contribute to the overall effort. Modifications to the News-Herald’s building are still underway in connection with the new equipment.”Heart transplants were first successfully completed during this time period, the first several being done in South Africa. By the end of 1968, doctors in Richmond had performed several too.The beginning of some things echoed the end of others — one being police and fire mascots. “Long a favorite with the youngsters in the area, Lady had spent 13 of her 15-year lifespan at the firehouse on Morgan Street. The men of the department were the only family she’d ever known. Until about two years ago, when the infirmities of old age began to creep up on her, Lady was a familiar sight riding the fire engine to and from the scene of fires. Since she was “grounded,” Lady had been accustomed to just running along beside the trucks as far as Johnson Avenue as they went out on call. Then she’d go back to the station to await the return of her “friends” — the eight men of the department assigned to the Morgan Street Station. This habit, apparently, was her undoing Tuesday night as she was caught beneath the wheels of the outgoing truck. Today, Lady has been buried and the Suffolk firemen are sad. Her death, too, marks the end of the mascot era in Suffolk. Another mascot, a canine named Jack, was as much a part of the Suffolk Police Department as any member of the force until his death about the time the Police Department moved into their present headquarters on Wellons Street. “I don’t want any more dogs,” Chief Baines said.JEN JAQUA is the creative director for the Suffolk News-Herald.

leoweekly_2023_5,"Inwhat’s already been a clunky campaign filled with disjointed messages and half-baked attacks, Daniel Cameron has been stumbling through the home stretch of the governor’s race as he starts to grapple with the reality of the hardline right-wing politics and tactics that he has aligned with.Polls indicate that Cameron, the Republican gubernatorial candidate and Kentucky’s current attorney general, has largely struggled to gain momentum against incumbent Andy Beshear as the Nov. 7 election nears, and that seems to be a catalyst for a few recent desperation moves by the challenger.Cameron has long been a staunch supporter of Kentucky’s draconian and cruel near-total abortion ban since it went into effect via a trigger law that snapped into place after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.The current version of the law, which Cameron has repeatably defended — including during a March primary debate — does not include exceptions for rape or incest.But, during a mid-September interview on NewsRadio 840 WHAS, he switched his stance.“If our legislature was to bring legislation before me that provided exceptions for rape and incest, I would sign that legislation,” Cameron said during the interview. “There’s no question about that.”“There’s no question about that.”Come on. If there was “no question about that,” then why did he hold on to that standpoint until seven weeks before an election?It’s not a new conversation. Republicans have been slowly chipping away at abortion rights for years.There was even a proposed amendment in this year’s General Assembly to add exceptions for incest and rape after Kentucky’s abortion law took effect. It received a lot of public attention, but was ultimately shut down by the Republican supermajority.Cameron likely thought that he could hedge his bets by sliding his perspective post-primary, stealing some pivotal centrist voters. But there are too many sharp journalists and activists in this state with the receipts, and they sniffed out the conflicting behavior immediately.While he’s trying to shift an election by shifting his ideology, it’s becoming glaringly obvious that Cameron is playing games with a very serious issue.“Either he lied about his position in order to secure a right-wing fringe group’s endorsement, or he’s lying to voters now,” Tamarra Wieder, Kentucky state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, said in a statement. “No matter which way Cameron tries to spin it, Kentuckians cannot trust him to lead our state or to create policies that impact our health care and our bodily autonomy.”As this race has heated up, Beshear has poured pressure on Cameron’s defense of the trigger law via a series of video ads, particularly focusing on the attorney general’s initial stance against the exceptions for incest and rape.That pressure also likely added to Cameron’s softened statements.Of course, politicians should continue to sincerely evolve their thoughts on issues in responsible ways, but this doesn’t seem like that. He’s starting to realize his connection with extreme right-wing opinions on abortion is a political liability. And now he’s trying to revise.And, while Cameron’s recent comments on abortion have dominated headlines, it’s not his only recent moment of conflicting comments.Another subject of several recent news reports was how Cameron responded to the Northern Kentucky Right To Life 2023 Election Candidate Questionnaire. He pledged yes to every question, including, “Will you actively support (and if in a position to do so, sponsor and vote for legislation which prohibits all use of local, state, federal, and/or Medicare or Medicaid funds for abortion (including chemical abortions, such as RU-486, or the so-called ‘morning after pill,’ Norplant, Depo Provera, or the so-called ‘standard birth control pill’ ?”When he was asked about the questionnaire during the WHAS interview, his response was, “I support birth control. I support contraception.”In a statement to Louisville Public Media, Cameron said, “It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest I oppose or want to criminalize birth control or contraception. I believe in upholding the fundamental right to religious freedom. No one should be compelled to act against their religious beliefs. That includes taxpayers.”His campaign also told Louisville Public Media in a clarification that the candidate “does not include emergency contraception or birth control in his definition of abortion.”Cameron is clearly careless with language and careless with his opinions. And that’s likely on purpose, to say what he needs to say to get elected — and appear more empathetic — before diving right back into the hard-right think tank.Cameron, who comes from the school of Mitch McConnell, is significantly more articulate and intelligent than some of the unpredictable alt-right mad dogs who have been elected at astonishing rates following the political rise of Donald Trump. But Cameron, like his mentor, attempts a more calculated and manipulative approach, although strategy could be collapsing.Elections are swung on all kinds of emotions and behaviors — fear, hope, chaos, cult of personality, blatant misinformation, hard truths, apathy, record voter turnouts — but they’re rarely won on candidate desperation.But, who really knows, though? Elections remain baffling.What’s not baffling is that Daniel Cameron is trying to make the end of this election cycle convoluted and messy because he’s in panic mode.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_111,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Donald Trump received an early Christmas present Tuesday, courtesy of the Colorado Supreme Court.In a move without precedent, the justices ruled 4-3 Trump was ineligible for the state’s 2024 presidential ballot, owing to his role in the attempted Jan. 6 overthrow of the federal government.However, the decision was stayed until Jan. 4, or until the U.S. Supreme Court agrees to take up the matter — a move that seems all but certain.The immediate impact was predictable: a headlong rush by Republicans to rally behind the party’s serially indicted presidential front-runner.“Removing Trump from the ballot in Colorado under this theory is spurious, likely unconstitutional &a sadly predictable but outrageous form of lawfare. SCOTUS should end this,” Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy wrote on the social media platform X.Before issuing his fulminating statement, Roy was last seen campaigning in Iowa on behalf of Trump’s fading rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.Naturally, Democrats and Trump foes reveled in the Colorado court’s decision. Any humiliation or formal rebuke is a welcome sanction for the aspiring tinpot dictator.But its practical effect may well be moot.The deadline for Colorado to finalize its presidential primary ballot is Jan. 5, which makes it quite likely — given the deferred decision — that Trump’s name will be included there on March 5. Colorado will be one of more than a dozen states voting that day to select the GOP nominee.Of course, there is the possibility the Supreme Court will uphold Trump’s disqualification and enough states will then follow suit to nullify his dangerous bid to reclaim the White House.But given the court’s ideological makeup and partisan inclinations, that seems as likely as Clarence Thomas stepping down and announcing his chairmanship of Retired Justices for Biden.Thus, the most important effect may be in the short term, which is to say the days following Tuesday’s decision.There are now less than four weeks left before Iowa Republicans cast the first votes of the 2024 election on Jan. 15. With time ticking, Trump rivals can ill afford a prolonged legal skirmish that consumes what little attention is paid the contest over the coming holiday break.A perceived assault on Trump — by Democratic-appointed Colorado justices, no less — only makes the insurrectionist ex-president more sympathetic to the GOP base; his support in polls soared last April after the first of four indictments.That, in turn, will makes it more difficult for Trump’s rivals to attack the front-runner — not that they’ve been all that willing up to now.Vivek Ramaswamy, the preternaturally pugnacious Republican hopeful, was quick with a statement calling Colorado Supreme Court decision “un-American, unconstitutional, and unprecedented.”Even though his candidacy is headed nowhere, Ramaswamy laid down a not-insignificant marker.“I pledge to withdraw from the Colorado GOP primary unless Trump is also allowed to be on the state’s ballot, and I demand that rivals Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie, and Nikki Haley do the same immediately,” he said. “Or else they are tacitly endorsing this illegal maneuver which will have disastrous consequences for our country.”Hyperventilating aside, none of those candidates seem likely to follow Ramaswamy’s lead. But each will now be required to stand up for Trump — again — or risk the wrath of their party’s base for failing doing so.Many Democrats, for their part, keep hoping for an easy out.They’re counting on rulings like the one in Colorado, or legal efforts underway in California and other states, to remove Trump from the ballot and end the threat of his return to the White House.But there’s no easy shortcut to short-circuit Trump’s comeback, notwithstanding the exultation over Tuesday’s court ruling.Assuming Trump is the GOP nominee, Democrats will have to beat him at the ballot box, as they should. A courtroom is no place to decide a presidential election — which is exactly what the Supreme Court did in 2000. The stain persists to this day."

Statistics show Memorial Day weekend to be one of the busiest and deadliest periods on America’s roads and highways.The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, AAA Mid-Atlantic local law enforcement and Virginia State Police are again focused on saving lives through increased seat belt use by participating in the national Click It or Ticket campaign, which runs through June 4.AAA predicts that more than 42 million Americans will travel for the long holiday Day weekend. That’s just 1% shy of the holiday travel numbers from the pre-COVID days of 2019. Nearly 90% of all travelers, or about 37 million people, will be on the roads. Here at home, 1.16 million Virginians will be traveling, with more than one million of them predicted to be hitting the roads.“The roads of Virginia will be very busy this weekend with holiday travelers, and that means there’s a greater potential for crashes,” says Morgan Dean, AAA Mid-Atlantic spokesperson. “We want everyone to be safe.

They are important to our physical and mental wellness. Prevention is any action on our part to keep us healthy and well. Early detection and diagnosis can improve health and save life.The saying or proverb, “Prevention is better than cure,” attributed to the Dutch philosopher Desiderius Erasmus about 1500, has become a fundamental principle in modern health care.I’ve just had a colonoscopy recently, my third, so far. Thankfully it went well. Many thanks to Dr. Ramirez at Lakeview Medical Center’s Bayview Digestive Health and Colorectal Surgery (Ambulatory Surgery Department and his team for a job well done.Colonoscopy is a medical procedure that uses a colonoscope, to examine the colon for possible colorectal cancer, colon polyps, tumors, ulcers, and other abnormalities there. The instrument allows the surgeon to view your colon directly which is much more accurate than an X-ray or stool test.Colon polyps are abnormal growth of tissue on the lining of the colon that can be cancerous. To determine if it’s cancerous or not, a biopsy is performed.Like any medical procedure, there may be complications that occur while having colonoscopy, such as perforation of the colon, bleeding and infection, or complications from anesthesia.The American Cancer Society recommends that individuals at average risk for developing colorectal cancer should have a screening colonoscopy at age 50 and every ten years thereafter. Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States.With routine check-ups, proper diagnosis, and periodic colonoscopies, colon cancer is preventable.The success of the exam depends on a clean, empty colon and large intestine. The procedure will be canceled or rescheduled if your colon (small and large intestines is not completely clean or empty.A week before my colonoscopy, I strictly followed a low-residue diet, with plenty of water or clear liquids so as not to be dehydrated.Two days before the exam, I took two Dulcolax tablets at bedtime. No more solid foods thereafter. Just clear liquids, no red or purple in color, the first thing in the morning on the day before the procedure. Then, at noon, I started drinking every he solution (the MiraLAX white powder mixed with 64 oz. of Gatorade (I chose the Frost flavor in a pitcher and chilled , every 15 minutes, until the entire mixture is finished.On the day of the exam, after giving the nurse the name and date of the last dose of any and all drugs or medicines (over the counter and prescribed taken recently, and after I changed clothes to hospital gowns and socks, and talking to my surgeon, Dr. Ramirez, I was wheeled to the exam room, transferred to a bed, where nurses and an anesthesiologist attended me.Ready for the procedure, I was sedated via an IV (intravenous that put me to a relaxed mood or sleep or (un consciousness, while my gastroenterologist examined my colon.After the procedure, I was awaken and then changed clothes.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_146,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°It’s not surprising that dozens of members of the U.S. House of Representatives are choosing to leave the dysfunctional chamber rather than seek another term. The politics are toxic. The rhetoric is ugly. And it seems that members aren’t interested in doing much besides fighting the culture wars — and one another.But we don’t believe for a minute that’s the reason former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy decided to step down at the end of the month after 17 years in Congress. After all, he helped create the hostile conditions in Congress by toadying to the hard-right Republicans in his conference by, among things, voting to challenge some of the results of the 2020 election and authorizing a baseless inquiry into impeaching President Biden.In the end, however, McCarthy couldn’t manage the unruly conference and was deposed in October after a mere nine months in charge. His crime, according to the GOP hard-liners who orchestrated his downfall? Taking the kind of sensible action that Americans expect of their leaders. He’s not a tragic hero, though. Just a victim of the MAGA flames he fanned.Of course, he’s bitter about being thrown over for doing his job and overseeing a bipartisan deal to keep the government funded. Of course he feels used by Trump, who didn’t help him keep the speaker’s job. Of course, he’s angry at the extremists who engineered his ouster — enough, allegedly, to sucker-punch one of them in the hallway.McCarthy did the right thing to avoid a government shutdown this year, but as someone who ascended to such heights of power, he should be expected to put service to the nation and his constituents before service to himself. He could have put aside his hurt feelings and indignation to serve the full term he was elected to.Instead, McCarthy is leaving early, perhaps as a way to strike back at the conference that rejected him (and humiliated him earlier this year through 14 unsuccessful speaker ballots before he was elected . His absence — along with the expulsion of Rep. George Santos last week — means the GOP‘s already slim majority will become even slimmer.But his hasty departure also leaves his ever-loyal voters in the Central Valley in the lurch. Gov. Gavin Newsom can call a special election, though it would overlap with the regular election that begins with a primary in March. Either way, his district will be unrepresented for some number of months.McCarthy made the announcement Wednesday in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, which wraps with this oddly sunny sentiment: “I go knowing I left it all on the field — as always, with a smile on my face. And looking back, I wouldn’t have had it any other way.”Really? It’s hard to believe he thinks this ending to a once-promising career was the best possible outcome. The former California legislator joined Congress in 2007, one of the Republican rising stars known as the “Young Guns” along with former Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia and and former Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.A more honest statement may have read: “You won’t have Kevin McCarthy to kick around anymore.”—Los Angeles Times Editorial Board/TNSNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."

(Madeline Carter/Las Vegas Review-Journal/TNS Las Vegans grieve one more time following a senseless multiple shooting. Will this insanity ever stop?Six years after a devastated community endured the Oct. 1 rampage on the Strip, a gunman on Wednesday opened fire at UNLV in Beam Hall, home to the business school. There were reports of shots fired at the Student Union. Three people were killed. At least one more was seriously injured.The violence began around 11:45 a.m. The campus bustled as students were preparing for semester exams next week. But the anticipation of holiday break was soon shattered by the horrific scene that unfolded.Students reported hearing shots and described barricading doors with tables to protect themselves. It’s a sorrowful sign of the times that many of these young adults have come of age at a time of active shooter drills intended to teach lockdown procedures during such an event. But this was no drill. A university police text urged students to “RUN-HIDE-FIGHT.”Allister Dias, editor of the Scarlet &Gray Free Press, UNLV’s student newspaper, told the Review-Journal, “I was working at my desk, and I heard like a series of sirens outside. I think it was like one or two cop cars, and I go to the window just to see what it is, and I saw kids running across the parking lot. I’m thinking, wait, what’s going on?” He then heard “very audible gunshots, like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.”By about 1 p.m. police reported that there was “no further threat.” Officers had “engaged” the suspect, Sheriff Kevin McMahill said. Yet many students and faculty remained hiding in classrooms, unsure whether it was safe to emerge. Police began going door to door on campus to reassure those still sheltering.Law enforcement — the Metropolitan Police Department and UNLV campus police — acted decisively to secure the campus area and address the threat. This likely saved many lives.The stale guns vs. mental health bickering that inevitably follows these horrific occurrences has already begun. But no matter where one comes down in that debate, a society that produces so many lost and delusional souls who believe their salvation requires mass homicide is suffering from deeper, more entrenched maladies. More details will emerge in the coming days. For now our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones and those in the UNLV family — parents, students, staff, faculty — forced to suffer unthinkable trauma.Las Vegas responded to the Oct. 7 shooting with compassion, strength, resiliency and a heightened sense of community that arises from shared tragedy.

suffolknewsherald_2023_41,"Published 3:30 pm Friday, May 19, 2023ByLetters to the EditorEditor:We’ve all had it happen. The words to that song or saying that won’t leave our head. I mention three of these that I’ve learned from meetings, readings and open conversations — all to do with the City of Suffolk’s growth.The first one that sticks with me: “It’s inevitable.” It used to be held that only two things were inevitable, death and taxes. Now, Suffolk’s growth has been added to that duo of inevitability. Since it is clearly defined as “certain to happen,” the question is whether Suffolk was prepared for the wave of rapid growth. Were resources available and dependable? The seven town hall meetings sponsored by the City of Suffolk gave citizens the opportunity to present ideas and expectations, past and present. To find a summary, go toSuffolk2045.organd search “Preliminary Results, Winter 2023 Community Engagement.”The second set of words I’ve got in mind is that Suffolk must “progress or stagnate.” Could there be the proverbial two-edged sword in those words? No progress — stagnate. Progress too quickly and have the possibility of lowering citizens’ standard of living and quality of life. The opinion piece of the Oct. 26, 2022 Suffolk Herald recognized the “collective funk of Suffolk’s citizenry” brought on by the City Council’s “fateful, less-than-unanimous decision to bless a mammoth warehouse complex.” Suffolk’s vibrant and progressive Agriculture will keep the City from becoming stagnant.Suffolk’s citizens aspire to “smart growth,” the third set of words in my head. CARE4Suffolk is a group of Suffolk residents who believe in smart growth. Their focus is on opposing rezoning that allows developers to build houses and other structures where adequate infrastructure does not exist, that impinge on natural resources, wetlands and farm land, not giving value to our agriculture community. Visit the CARE4Suffolk.org. website.Participants at a recent Planning Commission meeting sported smart growth tags to send a realtor and developer’s message that building expensive, modern homes benefit Suffolk’s citizens and community. Unfortunately, as the saying goes, “What may be good for the goose may not be good for the gander.” Expensive new homes have increased the assessed value of existing homes causing hardship for residents. My real estate assessment for FY 2022-2023 increased by 32.5%. That’s correct, by 32.5% with no chance of dividing that over two or three years.City representatives are elected to serve its citizens.

suffolknewsherald_2023_190,"Published 5:49 pm Tuesday, September 19, 2023BySuffolk News-HeraldThe stigma surrounding mental health in the United States remains a significant barrier to well-being. It’s a complex issue deeply ingrained in society. Despite increased awareness and efforts to reduce stigma, it persists.Public perception, as indicated by studies such as one conducted by the National Institutes of Health, reveals that there’s still work to be done. Stigmatizing attitudes can deter individuals from seeking help, exacerbating their suffering.However, there is hope, initiatives and resources, like those offered by the Western Tidewater Community Services Board. To combat the stigma, WTCSB continues to provide mental health support to residents of Suffolk and Franklin, as well as Isle of Wight and Southampton Counties. Alongside providing services to children and adults and services for substance abuse and crisis sufferers, WTCSB offers same-day access and intellectual and developmental disability services for residents in need.To address the stigma effectively, continued education, empathetic communication, and mental health promotion as a fundamental aspect of overall well-being are crucial. It’s a collective effort to reshape perceptions, and it begins with each of us acknowledging that mental health is as vital as physical health.In addition, WTCSB continues expanding its services to those needing mental health care.The recently announced the launch of its Region 5 Crisis Receiving Center, an urgent behavioral health care program at its Chuckatuck office at 5268 Godwin Blvd., during a Mental Health briefing during the City Council’s Sept. 6 work session.While mental health stigma in the United States persists, there are encouraging signs of change.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_84,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Rage is not a strategy.Israel has a right — and indeed a responsibility — to protect its people, recover its hostages and seek justice in the wake of the heinous attack by Hamas on Oct. 7. Overwhelming grief and blind fury are understandable reactions. Yet the desire for “mighty vengeance,” as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel put it, is no substitute for sound strategic thinking.I fear that Israeli officials — in their attempt to assuage a furious public — are making a terrible mistake at this critical moment for their people, their Arab neighbors, their American allies and the world.Ground troops have been readying an invasion that aims to, in the words of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, wipe Hamas “off the face of the Earth.” But there hasn’t been enough public communication in Israel about what that means. Does Israel aim to simply destroy Hamas gunmen and munitions stockpiles? It wants to topple Hamas’ leadership, but if that succeeds, who will rule Gaza in its place? Will Israel reoccupy Gaza and if so, for how long? What will be done to give Palestinians hope for a future in which they can finally live with dignity and freedom so that they don’t keep Hamas’ ideology of resistance alive?“I don’t know how this war will end, but I do know that by the time it’s over, Hamas will have lost not only their capability but their will to carry out such evil acts against us again,” Itay Milner, spokesperson for the Israeli consulate in New York, told me. He noted that the 2006 response to a hostage-taking by Hezbollah in Lebanon — which destroyed an entire section of Beirut — “was so significant that it made them seriously regret ever underestimating our power and resolve.”That military operation against Hezbollah was seen as a success — so punishing that it bought 17 years of relative quiet. But it also nurtured resentments that could help turn an invasion of Gaza into a wider regional war. This past March, Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, told a group of Iran-backed militia members to get ready for a war with Israel that would begin a new era and include a ground invasion, according to a report by The New York Times. Over the weekend, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, warned that attacks on Gazan civilians would trigger a reaction from Hezbollah, which has the military capability to cause a “huge earthquake” in Israel.Hamas appears to want to lure Israelis into Gaza and has been preparing for this battle for years.“This looks to me like a group that has come to believe its own narrative that Israel is a paper tiger and that it can defeat them militarily,” said Thanassis Cambanis, the director of the Century Foundation’s international research and policy center, who studies Islamist groups.Israel’s military is not a paper tiger; it is one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world. But it seems to be repeating the same mistakes the United States made after Sept. 11. Acting out of grief, rage and no small amount of hubris, America waged two costly wars, with deadly consequences for Iraqi and Afghan civilians and poor outcomes for ourselves in the end. Those wars empowered one enemy, Iran, and created a new one, the Islamic State group. And after maintaining an over-20-year insurgency in Afghanistan, the Taliban is back in power, proving that “dismantling” a terrorist organization is easier said than done. American overreach squandered the good will we’d gotten in the wake of the attack.By cutting off power, food and other essential goods to more than 2 million people in Gaza — until Hamas releases the hostages that are being held, Israel’s energy minister, Israel Katz, said — Israel is opening itself up to charges of collective punishment, which is illegal under international law. Nearly half of Gazans are younger than 18. Why should they pay the price for Hamas’ attacks?Over the summer, thousands of Palestinians staged protest marches in Gaza against Hamas’ rule. Hamas security beat them with batons. “They don’t even pretend to care about us,” one demonstrator told al-Monitor, an online news site. Now those same protesters are losing their homes, and possibly their lives, to Israeli bombs. Without power, many Gazans will lose the ability to pump water from wells or treat the wounded in hospitals. They are already losing contact with the outside world as their cellphones die. So they won’t be able to receive the evacuation warnings that Israel sends.Israeli officials tell me that Israel won’t let civilians in Gaza starve to death, and there are reports that Israel has agreed to turn water back on in southern Gaza, although, as of Tuesday morning, Gaza’s interior ministry said that hasn’t happened.President Joe Biden, who is expected to arrive in Israel on Wednesday, is said to be pushing for an agreement to get in humanitarian aid through Egypt. Supplies have been cut off not as an ultimatum to Hamas to release the hostages, Milner told me, but “to weaken the ability of Hamas to fight, since they use humanitarian aid for military purposes.” But some Israeli politicians have left the clear impression that the siege will continue until the hostages are released.“I strongly oppose the opening of the blockade and the introduction of goods into Gaza on humanitarian grounds,” Katz, Israel’s energy minister, said Monday on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. “Our commitment is to the families of the murdered and the kidnapped hostages — not to the Hamas murderers and those who aided them.”An Israeli member of the country’s parliament, Ariel Kallner of the Likud party, went further, calling for a “Nakba in Gaza,” a reference to the word “catastrophe” that Arabs use to describe the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Arabs in 1948 from what is now Israel at the country’s founding.A final thought: If Hamas is comparable to the Islamic State group, as Israeli officials now say, it’s reasonable to ask why so many civilians have been left in their care for so long.Israeli troops withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but didn’t try to turn that opportunity into peace. Israel didn’t strike a deal with the Palestinian Authority, which has renounced terrorism, to run the territory. Israeli soldiers just left. Dov Weisglass, a senior aide to Ariel Sharon, then the Israeli prime minister, famously boasted at the time that it was part of a plan to put peace talks into the deep freeze until “the Palestinians turned into Finns” — shorthand for people who won’t shoot rockets at Israel. If the plan was to keep peace talks on ice indefinitely, it worked.Palestinian factions fought each other in Gaza. Hamas won parliamentary elections in 2006 and violently expelled its main rival, Fatah, in 2007.Ever since, Gaza and the West Bank have been too divided to push for the deferred dream of statehood. But the Palestinians of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem are still waiting — and they aren’t turning into Finns.© 2023 The New York Times CompanyNEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

leoweekly_2023_4,"In 2004, when Kentucky was in the early years of a devastating rise in drug-related deaths, state officials understood that effective solutions depended first on reliable data. That led them to create the Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy, which quickly became a statewide leader in helping us determine the epidemic’s true size and how best to address it.It’s a proven model – and one we desperately need to repeat as Kentucky copes with another wave of preventable deaths, this time by gun violence.This issue is so important to me that it was the basis of my first-ever bill, which I filed moments after being sworn into the Kentucky House of Representatives in late February 2022.House Bill 644sought to create the Office of Gun Violence Prevention within the Department of Public Health, a move that recognizes this as the public-health crisis it is and which follows the path Congress took in 2019, when it authorized federal health officials to conduct this research after a more-than-two-decademoratorium.I sponsored a similarproposalduring this year’s legislative session, and will try again when the General Assembly reconvenes in January.There certainly is no denying the need.One in fiveAmericans has a direct connection to fatal gun violence, and 120 people are killed by a firearm every day. For Black Americans like me, the rate is 10 times worse than for those who are white.A recent poll by Pew Research Center underscores the fear many have, with about60 percentof Americans calling gun violence a major problem. That’s nine percentage points higher than in 2022, and about the same percentage expects the crisis to worsen in the next five years.I see this devastation up close in my legislative district, where I have received numerous calls from constituents distraught over loved ones who have been murdered in the prime of their lives. A lot of these victims are still in their teens, and many others their age tell me that getting a gun is easier than finding a job.There is a vast underground firearms market, and it’s the foundation of a grimstatisticshowing that, in both 2020 and 2021, firearm deaths killed more U.S. children between the ages of one and 17 than motor vehicle accidents or illness. Their mortality rate from gun violence has actually doubled in just a decade.We are failing our young people, but if there is one thing we have learned as a state with one of the highest incarceration rates in the country, pretending we can solve it by building new jails, prisons and juvenile-detention centers is not the answer.Many solutions have been offered by both sides of the political aisle, from loosening to tightening firearm restrictions to focusing more on mental-health treatment. We can cite one national statistic after another to back up whatever proposal we support, but we lack the Kentucky-specific data that would show us what would truly work best here.An office dedicated to data, prevention and serving as a channel for federal funding in these areas should not be seen as partisan, or as a prelude to any particular legislative action. It should be recognized simply for what it is, a source that will give us better information and more expertise to address something we all should want: an end to senseless gun violence.Last year, Congress passed bipartisanlegislationthat marked an important step forward in this area, and last month, the White Houseannounceda national Office of Gun Violence Prevention. Slowly but surely, we are finding more and more common ground rather than letting ourselves be governed by inaction.Just as we have learned with the drug epidemic, anecdotal evidence, political rhetoric and blind hope are not the foundation for good public policy. The Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy showed us there is a better way, and I believe that it is past time to walk down that path again. My legislation is the vehicle that can make this happen.

The measure — which was first put forward in Rhode Island earlier in 2023 — would hold employers accountable for psychological abuse committed on the job. Advocates for the bill define psychological abuse as “bullying and mobbing that violate an employee’s basic human right to dignity.”With bullying affecting nearly 80 million U.S. workers (roughly one in two overall , according to a 2021 survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute, there is an urgent need to counteract such abuse being tolerated or committed by employers, many of whom rely on loopholes in current laws to avoid facing penalties. The WPSA lays out a more stringent system for workers to seek recourse from, among other things, “common behaviors that a reasonable person would deem to be toxic.”While there are plenty of laws designed to protect employees from racism and discrimination in the workplace, these laws are far from perfect — and many do not account for abuses that are less blatant. As a professional credentialed teacher, I’ve seen colleagues being yelled at, intimidated and talked to condescendingly, none of which would, at present, be legally considered workplace abuse.Teachers are among the workers who need this act’s safeguards the most. There is no cookie-cutter approach to teaching. Every day is unique, challenging and exhausting. And expectations — especially for new teachers — are extremely high. Some students have different learning ability levels, language barriers, social-emotional and various other challenges. On top of these pressures, teachers face the threat of displacement.Put simply, displacement is a bureaucratic method to get rid of teachers. A school can justify displacement for reasons such as low enrollment or favoring teachers in certain subjects over others. But sometimes, administrators simply displace teachers because they don’t get along with them personally or professionally. One could say that displacement is a form of bureaucratic psychological abuse.Conditions that displaced teachers face can cause psychological issues like anxiety, depression, hypervigilance and post-traumatic stress. Newer teachers are often the ones displaced, and they are mainly placed in schools that they have not selected.It is time for unions and civil rights organizations to stand up and declare displacements unacceptable. Regardless of years of experience, all teachers must be treated with dignity and respect.We must get the WPSA signed into law in all 50 states. We must stand up for the rights of all workers to be treated fairly and with respect. The WPSA can serve as a legal protection for new teachers who, at times, may feel that their labor union may not advocate or represent them in relation to the issue of displacement.Teachers throughout the United States have an opportunity to demand that their school board members support and adopt the Workplace Psychological Safety Act.By implementing the principles of the Workplace Psychological Safety Act, school board members can set the example that bullying and psychological harassment of teachers is unacceptable and no longer tolerated."

This festival commemorated the illustrious career and life of Suffolk-born actor James Avery, whose name resonates deeply with not only residents of Suffolk but people across the nation.Avery played the role of Uncle Phil on the 90s sitcom Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, which aired from Sept. 10, 1990 until May 20, 1996. In the early ’90s, the show ranked among the top shows on NBC, reaching as high as the #2 spot on the list of top television shows on the network.While many were unaware Avery was Suffolk-born, more specifically, Pughsville, the event served as a reminder of the talent and contributions that individuals from Suffolk have made to the entertainment industry.The festival featured various activities, including film screenings, discussions, and performances centered around the actor’s work. It honored their achievements and provided a platform for emerging talents in the region.Suffolk has always been a wellspring of talent, and Averyfest was a fitting tribute to this legacy. It showcased the power of culture and art to unite and inspire a community.Events like Averyfest serve as a beacon of hope, reaffirming the importance of nurturing and celebrating local talent.

Below is a quote, from a person attending the “Give the Council Input for Suffolk” Sleepy Hole Borough meeting:“These are samples of some of the friendly, productive talks throughout the majority of the meeting. However, at the very end of the meeting, Council Member Roger Fawcett, of the Sleepy Hole Borough, got up to make some closing statements. He started out by saying that they are trying to do what is best for the city as a whole. He went on to say that if citizens say something, but it isn’t reflected in the comprehensive plan, don’t get upset. He further stated that the city has no control if a farmer wants to sell his land and make money, at which point, one of the community members stated, ‘the city doesn’t have to rezone it from agricultural to residential.’”Fawcett responded that he doesn’t want to talk about rezoning and he went on to reiterate his previous point about a person being able to sell their land. Several community members spoke out in response and stated in various ways that the farmer can sell and it can be developed as agricultural land like it is zoned for and not rezoned. Fawcett then made the statement, “If you get the attitude that you are going to stop something, get a life!” This set off a firestorm of responses from the crowd as a whole. His statement was not viewed favorably by the vast majority of attendees.To summarize, Roger Fawcett, a City Council member, who is also head of the steering committee for the comprehensive plan, the very group that determines future development in Suffolk, has told the citizens of Suffolk that they can’t change things and they need to get a life. This tone deaf response is insulting.If we, the citizens of Suffolk, truly believe in our rights, and that the people we vote for have our best interests in mind, you’d better think again, and vote our current Council members in the next election.

It’s the warmest season of the year, in the northern hemisphere, from June to August, and in the southern hemisphere from December to February, according to the dictionary.The heat is on, folks. It’s time to have a check up of your air conditioning unit at home or in your car. It’s hot and humid outside, once the sun appears on the horizon. If the temperature becomes unbearable, seek relief and shelter by staying indoors. Go to a cooler place. Drink plenty of water, if you feel dehydrated.It’s time to bring out those sandals, shorts and shirts again. Lighter, cotton clothes or outfits are preferable. Have sunscreens and the shades ready.Going to the beach, wading through the clear water, surfing through and swimming along with the waves, building castles, playing volleyball definitely offer a blast under the sun, with balmy air and/or soothing breeze.It’s undeniably the season of fun and sun.Summer activities are aplenty. There are people gamboling in the sand, basking in or reveling under the sun.There are more fun activities, more concerts and festivals and festivities on the beach or at the oceanfront. These are anticipated as we welcome summer with its bright colors, shades, sounds and music.Everywhere you see plenty of fruits — watermelons and cantaloupes — and summer drinks and treats such as shakes and smoothies.Let’s savor summer but with caution, though.

A survey the presenters had done indicated that 94% of presidents and chancellors (including me identified student success as part of their institutional missions and personal job descriptions. In this same survey, however, only 34% of campus leaders felt that their institutions had a definition of student success that everyone on their campus knew and agreed on.Recently I participated in a national webinar on student success. A survey the presenters had done indicated that 94% of presidents and chancellors (including me identified student success as part of their institutional missions and personal job descriptions. In this same survey, however, only 34% of campus leaders felt that their institutions had a definition of student success that everyone on their campus knew and agreed on.You might be surprised by the 60-point gap between those two numbers, but I was not. We may not have a precise definition of success, but we know what it looks like, and it can be different for individual students.We start, of course, with graduation rates. If a student graduates, they are deemed successful. If a student transfers away from UH Hilo but into a program that suits them better, that, too, is a success for us. Success also includes finding gainful employment after graduation, living a healthy life, and being an engaged citizen. Some of our students find success in all these dimensions, but others may only accomplish one or two, which is why precise definitions of success don’t really work.What really stood out to me in the webinar, however, was the comment that one of the audience members made later in the discussion: “We can’t deny our students the opportunity to fail.” In the middle of a conversation about success, you might think we should not be talking about failure, but this comment brought to mind a presentation that I made with a colleague several years ago entitled, “We fail our students by not teaching them to fail.”I was an honors dean at the time, and I found that my academically talented students were simply not prepared to fall short of excellence. A “B”grade was considered failure by some of them, leading to a crisis of confidence, a change of major, or some more serious reaction. We found that our students did not know how to fail and realized that part of our job was to teach them how to do it.First-generation students sometimes lack confidence, and for them, failure can lead them to question whether they belong in college at all. Those of us at the university need to be ready to help them up when they stumble and let them know that a failure is a learning experience, and that we all fail.Last weekend I had the opportunity to welcome nearly 150 high school students to our campus, and as I pondered what words of wisdom I could share with them, I decided to tell them the story of the Algebra 2 quiz I took in high school on which I got an F. I not only failed the test, but I did so brilliantly. I missed Every. Single. Question.I found the whole episode rather amusing at the time, but the moral of the story for the young people I was speaking to is that I dramatically failed that quiz (and certainly some other things in life and here I was as a university chancellor. We all know stories of someone who overcame failure, and it is important to share those stories along with the stories of success.How to pick oneself up and keep moving is a skill we can learn and that we have the responsibility to teach young people. As my colleague said, we cannot deny students that opportunity. What we can do, however, is remind them that failure is not an end, but a path toward learning. As our university vision states, “We learn from many sources.” Each time we fail at something, we find ourselves at a crossroads. Do we give up on that path or do we move ahead?I once had a student who failed a particular course five times. It was clear that particular class was not something he could grasp. Then, my responsibility to him was to find another way through or around this particular obstacle. Is there another class that will fulfill that requirement? Do we need to consider a different major? Sometimes the right choice is to change course, but the answer is never to quit. The student mustn’t give up and neither should we.Bonnie D. Irwin is chancellor of the University of Hawaii at Hilo.

suffolknewsherald_2023_217,"Published 7:31 pm Tuesday, August 22, 2023ByJen JaquaIn the first couple of years of the 1980s, Suffolk battled crimes of theft and school vandalism at a high rate. In March of ’81, police reported another incident in what was becoming a series of mysterious peanut thefts. More than a dozen 300-pound bags of shelled peanuts treated for seed were stolen. A previous theft was reported in which someone took four boxes of peanuts and three boxes of peanut oil from a railroad boxcar.In April, after months of planning, the Sister City Commission linked Suffolk County, England, and this city as sisters for cultural exchange.In July of ’81, a Whaleyville family experienced something a bit odd. “Tomatoes; Tomahtoes; Potatoes; Potahtoes? No matter how you say it, something unusual is going on in Whaleyville. When people plant potatoes, they expect to harvest potatoes — from under the earth. The Lloyd Seabolt family planted potatoes. What they are harvesting, however, are … you guessed it … tomatoes; above the ground; on potato plants. Mrs. Seabolt has no idea how the phenomenon came about. But about 10 potato plants bear little green tomatoes. The fruits of their labor have tomato seeds inside. They don’t look anything like spuds. Those seeds are being saved for planting next year. Maybe the Seabolts will reap topahtoes. Or pomahtoes. It doesn’t matter how you say it. Michel de Montaigne said it this way before 1600: ‘Let us permit nature to have her way; she understands her business better than we do.’”In September of that year, the opening of a hamburger chain in Suffolk turned into a champagne party. Traditionally, Wendy’s would throw big parties when coming into a new area and make contributions to local charities. To symbolize the 256 ways hamburgers can be prepared, Wendy’s gave $256 to the Morgan Memorial Library’s trust fund.In an effort to clarify Suffolk City in the beginning of 1982, the city and the Suffolk Beautification Commission worked together to let people coming into Suffolk know exactly where the city starts. Virginia’s largest city announced itself proudly at its boundaries with welcome signs. Each sign featured a peanut and the state dogwood flower, a design created by Parks and Recreation Department employee Judith Oswald.In March of ’82, Whaleyville again had some strange occurrences, but they were shared with the entire region this time. “Telephones started jangling in various homes as friends told neighbors to go outside and look up in the sky. They did, and what they saw, they could not describe. Slim Brown thought it was the woods on fire. The thing, whatever it was, defied definition. It had no body. It hovered just over the treetops, and turned everything red. ‘It wasn’t like an object, it was like a cloud,’ said Brown. ‘It set there for a while, and it had lights like headlights on a car. Several times a beam of light would go through the red cloud. It was a bright red.’ The neighbors all decided it couldn’t be a helicopter or an airplane, and they had no idea on earth what it could be. For a while the cloud disappeared. Then it came back at 10:30. The cloud was sighted by airplane pilots. The National Weather Service at Norfolk International Airport described the cloud as Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis. Usually, the lights don’t come this far south, he said, but they can when the magnetic field in the atmosphere gets disturbed.”Dry conditions and high winds led to a raging fire in April ’82. Fanned by 30 miles per hour wind gusts, it raced two miles from Shoulders Hill Road through to the Pughsville community, destroying 17 homes and damaging numerous others. It took an army of over 200 firefighters from 10 fire departments, some from as far away as Virginia Beach and Fentress Field, to battle the fire under control. The fire was believed to have started on Shoulders Hill Road near the S-curve across from Bennett’s Creek Park entrance. There were 10 fire departments, six rescue squads, two police departments, the Virginia Forestry Division, the Virginia National Guard and the Civil Air Patrol all taking part in the firefighting effort.Two months later, in one of his last official acts as Suffolk mayor, George H.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_106,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Americans tired of hearing about COVID-19 may greet the latest vaccine with a collective yawn, but residents and staff at nursing homes cannot be as cavalier. With infections rising in these facilities, governments and industry must work to protect those living and working in group settings from this potential killer.The rollout of the booster appears to be slow-going just as COVID presents a resurgent threat to America’s elderly, according to a report last week by KFF Health News, the national news organization formerly known as Kaiser Health News.While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved the latest vaccine on Sept. 12, many nursing homes will not begin inoculations until this month or even November. The delays come as infections in nursing homes are rising steeply, to nearly 1%, or 9.7 per 1,000 residents, as of mid-September, more than quadrupling from a low of 2.2 per 1,000 residents in mid-June.The holdup was caused in part by the formally declared end of the COVID public health emergency in May, which meant the federal government stopped purchasing and distributing COVID vaccines. That has created a logistics gap for the latest vaccine and confusion for distributors and nursing home operators alike as Americans seek the latest defense before the full start of the winter season.Nationally, 62% of nursing home residents are up to date on their vaccines, meaning they received the second booster available before the new shot that’s becoming available. That reflects a deeper commitment among older Americans generally to keep current on their vaccines, but a troubling gap in that age group remains.The situation is worse among nursing home staff. Nationally, only 25% of nursing home employees are up to date. That threat is amplified in a group home setting, where staff provide meals, activities and other all-around care, and where employees often hold second and third jobs elsewhere, compounding the opportunity for infection.While mandates are a thing of the past, the federal government and the states still have a leadership role to play. Public health authorities need to use their pulpits to urge people to get vaccinated, and officials need to provide whatever administrative and financial support possible to make supplies more readily available.This is hardly unknown or ancient territory; industry, government and health providers already know how to get COVID vaccines to the public. More to the point, governors in states with older populations, such as Florida’s Ron DeSantis, also showed early on during the pandemic how to prioritize a limited supply by putting seniors and other vulnerable populations first. The same game plan should apply here. Even Florida’s narrow guidance recommends that those 65 and older talk to their doctor about getting inoculated.The updated vaccines are available at no cost to most adults in the U.S. through their private health insurance, Medicare or Medicaid. The CDC has arranged for 25 million to 30 million adults lacking health insurance coverage to get free COVID shots at certain pharmacies and health centers. Now authorities need to talk up the boosters, and work hard, especially to increase vaccinations among nursing home residents and employees.

Its investigative reporters are among Hawaii’s best. That said, it also publishes commentaries which I sometimes disagree with.Naka Nathaniel’s (Dec. 13 bit on the U.S. military not paying their fair share to Hawaii is one. He writes the threat of Chinese aggression is no justification for any Pearl Harbor expansion.He goes on to point out David Daokui Li’s claim, “China simply does not appear to have the global ambition, institutional capacity, historical tradition or ideological clarity to replace and behave like the United States of today.” Li is a Chinese economist and a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing.Daily threats against Taiwan and the Philippines and extending their territorial claims to nearly the entire South China Sea tells a different story.While this behavior may not be a direct danger to the U.S., industrial espionage and the clandestine export of fentanyl precursors to the U.S. definitely are.China’s Belt and Road Initiative’s purpose is more than just facilitating trade. There are also military implications.China now has naval bases in Cambodia and Djibouti. The Chinese-built commercial seaport of Gwandar in Pakistan will also be made available to the Chinese navy.Chinese hacking of U.S. infrastructure is on the rise, with reports of a Hawaii utility company being a recent target.So, to imply Chinese aggression is not a threat to Hawaii is bogus.Don BakerVolcanoGreat medical careat Hilo facilitiesI recently broke my right hip and had emergency surgery at Hilo Medical Center, with follow-up rehab at Hale Anuenue.At both facilities, I was cared for like I was family, and I felt like everyone had my back.I can’t thank Hilo Medical Center and Hale Anuenue rehab enough.

Chesapeake decided to stake its claim to the “finest city.”War in Vietnam was officially over in March 1973. U.S. prisoners of war flew home for reunions with the families and friends they hadn’t seen for at least five years.On April 4, 1973, America’s last known prisoner of the Vietnam War landed on U.S. soil and was given a roaring welcome by 600 people shouting “Aloha, welcome home.” Army Capt. Robert T. White, 32, landed at Hickam Air Force Base aboard a C141 Starlifter jet on which he was the only returning POW. He was the last of 597 prisoners released from Vietnamese prisons during the 67 days of “Operation Homecoming.”In May 1973, due to conflict in the Middle East and a fuel embargo, the nation’s fuel crisis, with higher prices and declining supplies, was taking a marked turn for the worse. A gasoline rationing program was announced by Amoco Oil Co., the same day Cities Service Oil Co. instituted across-the-board price increases. Texaco, one of the nation’s largest petroleum refiners, predicted in Congressional testimony that there will be industry-wide gasoline “run-outs” by summer.In August, international major wholesale beef suppliers in New York City followed a national trend and closed for the day because of a shortage of beef. Elsewhere, thousands of meat packers were out of work as the shortage spread across the country. Panicked buyers hoarded meat in home freezers, meat distributors reported they were sold out, butchers turned away customers — and even the White House was turned down by its beef supplier.A price freeze was implemented. Dr. Reid Grigsby of Louisiana State University said there would be a shortage of meat until the price freeze on beef expired Sept. 12. He also predicted for two months after the freeze, the price of meat would increase rapidly. “I think you could pay a dollar and a half for a hamburger and be delighted to get it — and I mean a quarter pound of hamburger.”The shortages continued into 1974. In January, President Richard Nixon signed a bill requiring all states, as a gasoline-saving measure, to reduce the maximum speed limit to 55 miles an hour, under threat of losing federal highway money. Nixon said that driving slower reduces the amount of gasoline and diesel fuel needed to keep the nation’s motor vehicles rolling.Police reported in early February that they were looking for a car with aromatic exhaust smoke. Someone stole 60 gallons of gasoline at the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, where officials recently ordered perfume mixed with the gasoline to make thieves easier to catch.Even with shortages of gas to drive, in July 1973, the 5.4-mile northeast section of the Suffolk bypass opened.In November 1973, Nansemond’s Mills Godwin won a marginal victory as the first Virginian ever to be elected to a second term as governor.Suffolk was coming together as a city. In January 1974, a ceremony was held marking the merger of Nansemond and Suffolk. The new city’s future “rests on the twin pillars of jobs and education,” Governor-elect Mills E. Godwin Jr. told more than 200 Suffolk residents and visitors gathered to celebrate the merger of the two cities.Nationally, the country was ripe with scandal. In May 1973, a front-page story declared, “President Nixon personally authorized FBI wiretaps on telephones of more than a dozen members of his National Security Council staff in 1969 in an effort to track down news leaks, the White House said today.”Over a year later, on Aug. 8, 1974, Nixon resigned.After being sworn in on Aug. 9, Gerald R. Ford said, “our long national nightmare of Watergate is over” and asked the nation to “let brotherly love come to our country.”He pledged that as president he would be what he had always been — a plainspoken politician. “Our Constitution works,” he added. “Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule. But there is a Higher Power, by whatever name we honor Him, who ordains not only righteousness but love, not only justice but mercy. As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the Golden Rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and hate.”On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_169,"Published 5:22 pm Tuesday, October 24, 2023ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:After months of tractor-trailer cabs, primarily servicing the Amazon facility parking illegally in the Northgate Commerce Park, the City finally addressed the situation for one day. Yes, one day! After months of requests to the City to do something, it took a City Council Work Session Meeting on Oct. 18, 2023, to get some action. On the morning of Oct. 19, the trucks were gone. On the morning of Oct. 20, the trucks were back.Once we saw the trucks had gone, my wife and I, active members of Keep Suffolk Beautiful, went over to clean up the trash that had accumulated over this time and found bags of food trash, plastic bottles with urine, engine oil containers, blankets, rugs, broken mud flaps, and even a mattress strewed all over Maya Way right in front of the new Tractor Supply. The trash and smell was overwhelming. The weeds are so high on City property you can’t even see over them. There are no less than six NO PARKING signs all over the cul-de-sac. Still, truckers ignore them because no one enforces the municipal ordinance, which is clearly noted on the signs, the same as the trucks traveling up and down Shoulders Hill Road with a no-through truck prohibition.This is just one example of the multiple issues these distribution centers have brought to Suffolk over the last few years. The City has been slow to address any of these. Yes, there are benefits to having warehouses in our City when they are properly cited and regulated, but neither has been the case to date. Did you know that a developer could put a warehouse within 30 feet of Florence Bowser Elementary School tomorrow with no public or City Council input? Those upper-end residential units in Harbourview? Under attack!Citizens Voice, a local nonprofit dedicated to addressing the concerns of Suffolk citizens as they pertain to land use issues, has been addressing citizens concerns regarding the improper siting of warehouses within the City for months. We have provided the City with documented and referenced evidence from subject matter experts, state governments, industry representatives, researchers, scholars, and more on the negative impacts of noise, diesel emissions, property values, and more that these “warehouses” have on our citizens. The City’s current proposal to establish an ordinance that would provide specific guidelines to regulate “warehouses” is long overdue, but after a thorough analysis and consultation with independent third-party subject matter experts, Citizens Voice believes it lacks standards that would protect our citizens from these negative impacts.Thomas ReinPresident Citizens VoiceOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2023_15,"Living through the first days of the war between Israel and Hamas has taught me that compassion is one of the most important human traits. During the first six days of the war between Israel and Hamas, I was just outside of Jerusalem with my husband, who is Israeli, and our 2-year-old son. A trip that was meant to be a joyous visit with family quickly turned into a terrifying week of living in a bomb shelter, followed by 68 hours of travel, including three layovers, back home to Philadelphia. A bomb fell a few blocks from where we were staying in Abu Ghosh, another on the hill right outside our home. One of our neighbors’ sons was killed in the blast, and his mother was severely injured. We have cousins fromKfar Aza who were raided by Hamas; they barricaded themselves in safe rooms and made it through the night while many of their neighbors were murdered. Living through the first days of this war has taught me that compassion — for all families impacted by this war — is one of the most important human traits. And compassion is something that we desperately need more of, especially now. On Sept. 28, what feels like an eternity ago, my husband, son, and I arrived in Israel, eager to see our family for Sukkot. The air hitting our faces at the airport was warm and smelled like jasmine blossoms, and I looked forward to my first of many cups of pomegranate and passion fruit juice. We were supposed to return to Philadelphia on Oct. 20. The first days of our trip were packed with visits to friends and family, trips to the park, hikes to mountain springs for a dip, great food, and lots of laughter. On Oct. 6, we traveled to Ashkelon, a city by the sea in the south of Israel, to celebrate our niece’s 1st birthday with a potluck, cake, and face painting. We had considered spending the night, as my father-in-law was set to receive an award at his synagogue the next day, but my husband insisted that we drive back to our apartment in Abu Ghosh, a decision that might have saved our lives. The next day,we woke up to news of war. And then the air raid sirens started, haunting and loud. When these alarms went off, we had 90 seconds to take cover in a safe room. Ours has a window with a metal door that can be closed from inside, and the main door is thick, designed to shut like a vault. My husband told me to breathe, scoop up our baby, and start to count. On Oct. 9, we were out of diapers and clinical cream for my 2-year-old, who had a diaper rash. My husband needed to go to town to buy them, and we hadn’t heard a rocket in 12 hours. As he prepared to leave, my toddler started crying. “No, Abba! Sit, Abba!” During that five-minute delay, we heard the siren again. Seconds later, we heard a bomb close by. Smoke seeped in from the porch. We called our friends in the village, who told us that one of the bombs had dropped on the street where my husband would likely have been driving. Did our son sense something? This small delay may have saved his father’s life. For the next days, air raid sirens became routine. During one, I was changing my son’s diaper and I had diaper cream on my hands. I started counting: One. Two. Close his diaper. Three. Four. Pick him up. Five. Six. Grab my cell phone and laptop. Seven. Eight. Open the door to the shelter and close it firmly behind me. Residents of Abu Ghosh — a peaceful, Muslim village — have 90 seconds to get to the safe room because of how far we are from Gaza. Tel Aviv has 90 seconds. Our relatives in Ashkelon have 30 seconds. For Israelis who live in a border town, they have no seconds. The alarm is that they hear the bomb in the air and run to the safe room. Sheltered in that safe room, alongside cans of beans and bottles of water and nuts and seeds, I focused on calming my son. We counted the bombs together to try to make them seem less scary. I sang “The Itsy Bitsy Spider.” As soon as the alarms stopped, we had to wait 10 full minutes before we could exit. I had once thought — naively, perhaps — that no matter how difficult a situation was, the U.S. Embassy in Israel would rescue our family. I now know otherwise. For a time, it seemed that my toddler and I would have to leave without my husband because he is a green card holder. The return journey was not easy. Our flights changed multiple times, and for a moment it seemed like we might be evacuated by land or by sea. On Oct. 12, my husband, toddler, and I boarded a flight from Tel Aviv to Athens, Greece. I made eye contact with the flight attendant as she filled up a water bottle for my child. She looked tired. “Thank you for being here,” I said. “I know that you and the entire crew have been operating on fumes. How is your family? Are they safe?” She started to cry, and instinctively, I reached out to give her a hug. “No one has asked me that,” she told me. “Not once.” This, too, is an impact of war. Back in the U.S. customs line, not yet in Philadelphia but close, we handed our passports to the officer for the routine check, stamp, and inquiry about where we had been. The officer looked at me as she slid our passports under the glass, and in that gaze, I felt her concern and recognition of the gravity of what our family had just survived. She said, “Welcome home.” Aisha Loeks is an artist and business owner who lives in Philadelphia with her husband and 2-year-old son."

This is exemplified by the fact that for every dollar spent at a local business, approximately $0.67 remains in the community, according to economists.Small businesses often support local causes and initiatives that are important to each community individually. When you choose to shop locally, you contribute to these businesses’ ability to give back to the community and support charitable endeavors at a local level.Small Business Saturday celebrates the diverse range of local busiessential to our communities’ fabricunities. It provides an opportunity to discover and appreciate the unique offerings of these enterprises and celebrates the people who own and operate these businesses.Let’s not forget about job creation. Shopping locally has a direct positive impact on job creation. The more money staying within the community leads to more employment opportunities, contributing to the overall prosperity of the locality.Small Business Saturday was specifically created to address challenges faced by local businesses. By promoting the value of shopping llly it encourages consumers to invest in their communities and contributes to the success of small enterprises.Small Business Saturday is not just a day to shop; it’s a movement that empowers communities, fuels economic development, and celebrates the unique character of locally owned businesses. By actively participating in this event, individuals can make a tangible difference in the prosperity of their neighborhoods.So, after you finish your Amazon order on Friday, make a plan to head out to your local brick-and-mortar and support them as well. You will not have to travel far. There will be a host of local businesses downtown for the Small Business Saturday event being held along Main St from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. We can’t think of a better way to celebrate and support our local businesses.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

I am infuriated after reading your article titled, “Suffolk women charged with a felony for misconduct as a deputy,” published Thursday, Sept. 7, 2023. Not only did Katie McCann Illegally convey items to a prisoner, she proudly smiled in her mug shot. Although the Southampton County Sheriff’s suggestion does not reflect the whole agency, I strongly disagree. As a citizen of a surrounding area, I wonder how many other deputies are doing the same as Katie? I think the security in jails/prisons needs to be more strict regarding deputies. Limit how many things that can be brought in and more thoroughly pat down deputies entering the building.Jada CarrSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_51,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°The House Republican spasm that began with bomb thrower Matt Gaetz’s vendetta against Speaker Kevin McCarthy and saw the conference’s civil war cycle through five leaders in three exhausting weeks seems to have cooled with Wednesday’s election by the unanimous GOP members of new Speaker Mike Johnson (or is it Mike Jackson ? We were so unfamiliar with this Louisianan from Shreveport that we didn’t know his name or his face before he rose to the top Tuesday night after Speaker-designate Tom Emmer’s tenure died after four hours.Emmer won the title after he beat eight rivals (including Johnson who ran after Speaker-designate Jim Jordan was rejected by the GOP members following three failed elections on the House floor, when moderates refused to put the radical second in line to the presidency. Emmer garnered a majority of his Republican peers after five secret ballots, which could have done much more efficiently on a single tally using ranked choice voting. But the right wing balked because Emmer supported gay marriage and accepted Joe Biden’s victory over Donald Trump. Trump also trashed Emmer.But before Speaker-designate Johnson and Speaker-designate Emmer and Speaker-designate Jordan there was Speaker-designate Steve Scalise. He lasted a full day before quitting. We think that brings us up to date.Johnson just saw his congressional salary jump 28.4% from the rank-and-file annual pay of $174,000 to the speaker’s post of $223,500. In New York politics, that extra money for legislators is called a lulu, and they are so rare in Congress that there are only three in each chamber, two for the majority and one for the minority. In fact, it was us who informed Brooklynites Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries that they were getting raises when they joined the top rung of leadership.But back to Johnson. Who is this guy who’s only in his fourth term and is now in charge? He is a Trump fan who won his first election in 2016, when Trump won. In 2020, Johnson was the main instigator in the House of a hopeless legal effort to have the courts throw out the Electoral College results in four states won by Biden.In his speech Wednesday, he pledged to have a resolution in support of Israel be the first matter of business for the House, which did happen, passing with 412-10. But that bipartisan unity will not last long. And neither may Johnson.The new speaker’s father was a Shreveport firefighter who was badly burned in a 1984 blast that killed another firefighter and who died right before the younger Johnson was elected in 2016. Johnson should honor his dad, and all firefighters, by fully funding the World Trade Center Health Program, which covers the medical bills of first responders suffering from 9/11-related illnesses.He’ll have to deal with aid for Israel and Ukraine and funding of the government for the federal fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. It was McCarthy’s correct deal with the Senate and White House to keep Uncle Sam going that caused Gaetz’s rebellion. We note that Johnson voted to shut down the government. Johnson will get his own chance in just 22 days, on Nov. 17, which is when McCarthy’s deal expires. He better be careful or his speakership will be very brief.— New York Daily NewsHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2023_36,"It’sPride month, and what I didn’t want to do was push trauma into the faces of LEO’s LGBTQ+ readers. There is enough news about how the queer community is being demonized and scapegoated by politicians, and I didn’t want this space to be that. I feel like we all know those stories, and with 491 bills across the country, the hatred is systemic. What I did want for this issue was some respite, a bit of joy, and stories that lift this community.I try to do the same with issues of trauma across the board. I think LEO can report relevant news without trauma porn.My interactions with the LGBTQ+ community came as a young child. I have gay family, as we all do, but I didn’t know what “gay” meant until I was about 11 and learned that my best friend’s mother was a lesbian. What I knew then was that I became a second daughter, deeply cared for and welcomed into her home on a daily basis. I met her partners, broke bread across her table, and when my parents were working — and the need arose — my sister and I were given shelter with her. So my impression of what it means to be a member of the LGBTQ+ community is informed by the safety and acceptance I found without question in the home of this woman whom I still consider family.As I grew through the ‘80s, aware of the AIDS crisis, and saw the fear-mongering that pushed a struggling queer community to the brink of death, I saw people who locked their arms around each other and anyone who needed them to fight in the streets and in the halls of policy-making for the right to live with dignity.What I know now is that what is happening is a reminder that the same forces that made anti-gay policies in the ‘70s and ‘80s have been in power too damned long.It’s time for those fights to continue because, once again, the risk is the safety and health of individuals within the LGBTQ+ community.Because it is Pride month, the act of celebration needs to be the fight. This month is a time for recharge, fellowship, and fun. It is space to organize and prepare for what comes next. Who are the politicians that will come from this community and move this country from those 491 anti-LGBTQ bills to zero?I’ve been around long enough to know that this fight won’t be won by hatred and that this community is fighting and will continue to fight to make America move closer to the place it claims to be.To get there, I can’t expect the LGBTQ+ community to fight alone because this fight is also the fight against anti-Blackness, anti-immigration, and against any other attempt by the global minority to push those with less power farther to the fringes as they scramble to maintain their hold on dying ideologies.In the end, these dinosaurs won’t win.But it is June, the month that commemorates the “Stonewall Riots” when police brutality and mistreatment pushed this community, at the site of the Stonewall Inn, to fight back.Remember, it is radical to celebrate in the face of adversity, and it is radical to be proud of who you are when you are the most ‘hated.’ And when you’re ready to jump back into the fight, give it everything you’ve got.•*** ."
eugeneweekly_2023_30,"We ve got issues. I’ve just returned from the Oregon Country Fair, for what I believe was my fifth time attending. After the 50th year, I had decided that I wouldn’t go again. While I won’t delve into the specific reasons behind that decision, I can say that OCF, like the rest of America, grapples with issues of race, class and privilege. Unfortunately, OCF seems to adopt a colorblind approach, turning a blind eye to the experiences of individuals like myself who fall outside the norm. However, this year was different. I had the privilege of being part of the BIPOC Oasis, organized by the fiercely protective and inspiring Stormie True, who this year became the coordinator of the Oasis. Last year was the first time the BIPOC Sanctuary was at the Fair; however, it was housed in the Rainbow Connection. Now the Oasis has its own space in Xavanadu. Stormie, who worked on shift last year in the sanctuary uses “joy as resistance” to create change at OCF, where she has been attending since 2001. For me, OCF has always been a transactional weekend. OCF seemed to be little more than an outside mall of local art. I spent my time going from a retail booth, to a stage for live music, back to a retail booth in repetition. Or, I would spend a majority of my time at my camp to avoid the crowds. But working at the BIPOC Oasis this year was truly transformative. After a decade in Oregon, and five years at OCF, I finally found communities where I felt a sense of belonging. The Oasis is a BIPOC refuge from OCF, where BIPOC people can relax and reflect on the experience of OCF. For many people, including myself, OCF can be a triggering and overwhelming experience with no escape. The Oasis creates an escape from the overwhelming sounds, smells and sights. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. I understand the frustration of those who may feel excluded from the Oasis. Being told that you can’t access a space is a different experience for those used to having complete access, and I empathize with their concerns. Some may be surprised that other Fair-goers came to “lecture” us about our space, but for me, it’s simply part of the OCF experience. I belong to the group that recognizes this reality. The truth is, not every space can be for everyone. Oregon’s history includes the exclusion of Black people from settling in the state until 1926, which is why the state is still 86 percent white, according to the 2022 U.S. Census. Oregon Country Fair itself is an incredibly exclusive community. Inside the Fairgrounds, there are spaces exclusively for women, saunas with a $12 entrance fee, designated areas for kids, private camps and many other spaces limited to a select few. The BIPOC Oasis is the newest addition, and I hope it serves as a catalyst for the creation of more inclusive spaces, starting with a safe space for transgender individuals. I never considered myself part of the OCF Fair family, nor did I imagine bringing my children, I do now. I never thought I’d be an old man strolling the grounds, I do now. As someone from the Washington, D.C. metro area, the culture and ways of Eugene still feel foreign to me even after 10 years. However, knowing that this space and community exist makes my time in Eugene a little more tolerable. Finding your tribe is challenging, and when you do, you fight to hold onto it."

leoweekly_2023_61,"LEO is dedicated to bringing you engaging, fun, and unique content that crosses many spectrums. From our sister paper in Tampa, Creative Loafing, we’re happy to share the Oracle of Ybor, written by Caroline DeBruhl. Here you may submit your questions about life, and the tarot will help to guide your answers.Dear Oracle,I adore my parents and enjoy being regularly in touch, but I’m challenged by their inability to reflect on the past and learn from it in a therapyesque fashion. As I am trying to work through trauma and challenges of my youth, it would be so valuable to have them on board and able to offer insight; unfortunately, they get very defensive and angry when I attempt to do so. I want to try to break patterns in the familial thread that lead to these traumas but feel powerless to do so without their help. Will I ever break the faulty chain?-a faulty chromosomeCards: The Fool (rev , Five of Cups, Eight of Pentacles, Two of Wands (rev. Dear Faulty Chromosome,A therapist might tell you that forgiveness is not about excusing the other person’s behavior but allowing yourself space to move on from that hurt. And there’s a reason why they talk about forgiveness as a one-way street: not everyone thinks they did something that needs forgiving.To answer your questions briefly: yes, you can break the faulty chain because you can recognize the pattern and choose not to follow it. That’s The Fool’s journey here: you’re becoming conscious and starting down a new path. But not everyone is going to want to join you.Our parents are complex and contradictory and kind of fucked up, like all humans are. Some parents really knock it out of the park when it comes to child-rearing. Some rightfully have CPS called on them. Most fall on a spectrum between. It seems like you really want a better relationship with your parents than it has been, but there’s a breakdown in communication, which is what we see from the Five of Cups.The Five of Cups is about dysfunction in a relationship, an issue that leaves both parties unhappy. But the Five of Cups is about how thingsfeel,not how they actually are. Our memories aren’t reliable; with time, little changes can occur, or parts can be forgotten. This is especially difficult when talking with a parent about incidents from childhood because what might be a hurtful memory for you might not even register in their mind. They might not remember an episode of abuse or, in their minds, might remember it as something different. The “Truth” is probably some combination of both memories—but that doesn’t really matter. You felt hurt by your parents, and you would like them to acknowledge that they hurt you.And the truth is, I don’t know if they ever will. The Two of Wands is looking back; your parents have and hold onto a different version of the past than you do. If you want to forgive your parents, that forgiveness will have to come without an “I’m sorry” from them. It’s shitty. I’m sorry.But you don’t have to continue down that family path. Remember, you’re on your own journey as The Fool. With the hardworking Eight of Pentacles, I think a therapist could help you process your past and support you as you move on.Breaking out of unhealthy familial patterns is an incredible goal. I wish you well on this healing journey.Dear Oracle,I’ve never been super gung-ho about the prospect of giving birth. Still, as my window of opportunity shrinks with the passage of time, I have become increasingly curious about the experience. A large part of me wants to step into the new challenge of human experience, and so I accept that as “wanting to have kids.” Is this reason enough?-Cautiously CuriousCards: Nine of Wands (rev. , Seven of Wands, Knight of Swords, The Hanged ManDear Cautiously Curious,My very wise mother has often told me this: almost nothing in this life is irreversible. It might take a lot of money, time, or lawyers, but almost no decision is for life.The one caveat she would mention is choosing to have kids. Once you decide you want to, and they arrive, and you start raising ’em, that’s it. Technically, you can surrender them before age 18, but that’s not great for a child’s psyche or self-esteem, so I strongly encourage that situation to be avoided if possible.You are sitting at a precipice: to have kids, to not have kids. The cards suggest a total commitment one way or the other.The wands, both Seven and Nine, show that there needs to be some sort of breakthrough. It’s a change that feelscorrect on all fronts, almost like an epiphany. Once this clicks, the path forward feels obvious. The trick is how to get there.Your letter is very “heady” when it comes to pregnancy. You mention “curiosity” and seem to intellectualize the process, interpreting those thoughts as you “wanting to have kids.” With that impulsive intellectual, The Knight of Swords, you can intellectually get behind this idea—but you also need your heart in agreement.The Hanged Man is often misunderstood, and while it looks like he’s being tortured, he’s content with himself. He knows in his heart and his gut what’s right.Intellectually you could talk yourself into having kids as easily as you could talk yourself out of having them. But I think, deep down, you have a true answer. There is something in your gut that you know, even if you haven’t discovered it yet. I can’t tell you what that is, nor can the cards. Only you can crack that nut.So journal, meditate, make a shamanic journey—whatever you need to help uncover those feelings, do. I know you’re worried about your fertility window, but I think it’s better to be sure and possibly go an alternate route (surrogate, adoption than to discover that your heart wasn’t in it. It’s a big decision but I know you’ll find an answer. Take your time, my dear.*** ."

Nurses are leaving the profession due to the high stress load. A depletion of nurses affects us, how we are cared for as a society, and the next generation.Not to mention, almost a quarter of nurses have answered that they had contemplated leaving the workforce due to COVID-related crises, job fatigue (24.7% , safety (39% , retirement (21.6% , and caregiver strain (9.3% .In 2019 and 2021, about 5,000 nurses have left the field, the state Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs reported. Given these points, many nurses are departing the profession, and as a state, we need to make up those numbers to increase the workload.Correspondingly, solutions for the nursing shortages could be to provide more qualified nursing professors to help out each of the colleges in Hawaii, adding more seats for nursing students.Another resolution could be more funding to supply for the nursing program.If no action is being carried out, patient mortality will increase, which will be linked to higher death rates. Next, nursing burnout will rise, leaving them to work overtime and feeling overwhelmed.Having inadequate nursing staff may harm a patient, increasing the length of their stay. It may also increase wait time in the facilities, affecting the quality of care for patients.Uniquely, if people respond with action, it will leave fewer burdens on the nurses and will have a significant impact on the community, such as smaller amounts of individuals coming into the hospitals, shorter hospital stays, and, most importantly, fewer deaths.Lorieanne DomingoHilo"
eugeneweekly_2023_7,"We ve got issues. A central fixture of American street corners, one that’s synonymous with automobiles, road trips and the luxury of unbridled movement, is becoming increasingly obsolete: gas stations. In a market environment where electric vehicles dominate and continue their exponential growth, up to 80 percent of the current fuel-retail market may be unprofitable in 15 years, according to the Boston Consulting Group. But gas stations aren’t just a failing business model — they’re detrimental to both human and environmental health, and fuel what is a widespread problem of underground petroleum contamination. To help mitigate this problem, Eugene should ban the construction of new gas stations. Gas stations are a severe liability largely due to leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs . Typically, gas stations have two or three of these giant, submarine-shaped underground storage tanks (USTs , each of which can hold tens of thousands of gallons of petroleum and its many hazardous components, including methyl tertiary-butyl ether (a suspected carcinogen , lead (a neurological inhibitor , benzene (a known carcinogen and several others. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. USTs leak when the tank, gas pump, or connecting pipes corrode over time. Regular, mandated inspections could mitigate the damage from leaks that occur unnoticed for years, but when USTs do leak, these chemicals pollute a wide area even in small quantities. For instance, a 10-gallon leak has the potential to contaminate 12 million gallons of water. Given that 115 million Americans rely on groundwater for drinking water, 45 states have designated USTs as a major threat to groundwater quality. Many of the first USTs in America were established after World War II, but there was one issue: these USTs were made from unprotected steel, as opposed to the modern fiberglass equivalent, making them extremely prone to developing holes through oxidation. Big Oil understood this as early as the 1930s, but rather than addressing it, the industry programmatically disinvested from UST systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Around that same time, the federal government started implementing regulations through the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act as well as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Since USTs had been slowly leaking for decades, however, the small business owners who acquired these systems inherited huge amounts of liability. For reference, a 2004 survey by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that the average cost of cleaning up 95 service stations was $243,299 — which is $398,530 today. LUST cleanups are generally financed through private insurance or through state financial assurance funds, special funds that are subsidized through a flat tax on state petroleum sales. These funds have paid approximately $20 billion to clean up LUST sites over the past 21 years, but in the late 1990s, many were on the brink of insolvency. This forced the EPA to make some changes. Enter Risk-Based Corrective Action (RBCA , EPA’s current framework for LUST sites that attempts to balance maximum risk reduction with finite resources for cleanup. According to Matthew Small, an EPA regional science liaison, the agency transitioned from asking, “How much of the compounds of concern can we clean up?” to asking, “How much of the compounds of concern can we safely leave in place?” Consider how RBCA was applied in the cleanup process of a former Chevron service station on Franklin Boulevard, where the 515 Apartments now stand. Beginning in 2004, the cleanup removed 568,000 gallons of petroleum-contaminated groundwater and enough petroleum-contaminated soil to fill over 550 dump trucks. Seven years later, the soil was still contaminated enough that chemical vapors could seep through cracks in building foundations and pollute indoor air. To avoid that risk without continuing remediation, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality prohibited residential use on the first floor of the 515 Apartments. Out of the 570,964 confirmed releases from USTs nationwide, 58,483 LUST sites still require cleanup, including 114 active cleanups in Lane County that will likely leave some contamination in place due to RBCA. Underground petroleum contamination is a widespread problem caused by corporate neglect that has been routinely mismanaged to the detriment of communal safety and environmental sanctity. The first of many steps that should be taken to address this problem is banning the construction of new gas stations. To support a clean energy transition, testify for a moratorium on new gas stations when Eugene City Council votes on the proposal this fall."

suffolknewsherald_2023_145,"Published 6:05 pm Tuesday, January 24, 2023ByStaff ReportsWe pick up trash at Lone Star Lakes Park just about every Monday.The staff at the park does a really great job of keeping it clean and it is one of the cleanest parks we know. The 1,172 acres is a lot of park to keep clean so they can always use a little extra help.Biff gets the big stuff and I go for the small bits. My pet peeve is cigarette butts. You’d be surprised how many are tossed in just one small gravel parking spot overlooking beautiful lakes for fishing and kayaking like Lunker Landing, Bluegill Hill or Citation Station to name a few.Folks just don’t think cigarette filters are pollution. They’re just made out of paper and cotton…right? Well, that is wrong and a big misconception.Cigarette filters are the most common form of plastic pollution, about 4.5 trillion butts worldwide says one study. That’s more than the dreaded plastic water bottles or soda straws. We sure do get plenty of those, too.Cigarette butts can leach all kinds of nasty stuff into lakes and streams, such as lead, arsenic and nicotine, all of which pose a serious threat to the wild environment. These little poison bombs take about 10 years to completely degrade.Not only are cigarette filters a threat to the wild environment, they are a serious danger to pets. We know this from first hand experience.Recently we were walking the archery trail at LSL with our sweet little Jack Russell, Remy, who is just a year and a half old — that age where a pup will eat just about anything that smells good. She is fast at everything she does — especially eating.Unknown to us at the time, she sniffed out a spot where folks had been smoking and had pitched the butts on the ground. She had been picking them up and eating them like popcorn. By the time we got home she was disoriented, unable to stand without falling down and having tremors.Cigarette filters contain roughly 4-8 mg of nicotine. Nicotine is a neurotoxin that affects the brain and central nervous system. It only takes 5 mg of nicotine per pound of weight in a dog to be toxic. Depending on the size of the dog, more could be lethal.It turns out our sweet pup had ingested nine.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_10,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Matthew Perry attends the GQ Men of the Year Party 2022 at The West Hollywood EDITION on Nov. 17, 2022, in West Hollywood. (Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for GQ/TNS We’re still waiting for the official cause of death for Matthew Perry, who was famous for starring in “Friends” and struggling mightily with substance abuse. Even in the addiction recovery world, I’ve heard people suggest Perry’s legacy depends on whether the pending toxicology reports show he suffered a relapse. They couldn’t be more wrong.Yes, Perry died of still unknown causes. More important, he changed the conversation about addiction in our country. More people will get help because of his bravery. Fewer people will die.But … did it get him in the end? And shouldn’t we know that before we talk about his recovery — whether it stuck or not?That type of thinking is exactly what keeps people sick. Shame is an ally of addiction, and this notion threatens people in recovery with the possibility of extra shame: that no matter what you do to get sober, if it ends poorly, it was all worth nothing.Even in the recovery world, where we say “relapse is part of recovery,” the most valued story is that of a person seen as fully recovered.So when you’re a relapser like me, what you hear is that everything you learned during your last sober stint is worthless and you’re now back to square one. And how many times can you hear that before you’re tired of starting over?If you were driving across the country and your car broke down, would you get it fixed and then go back to where you started your trip to begin again? That doesn’t make any sense, but it’s exactly how we talk about addiction and relapse.Learning, growth, healing, amends, reconnection — none of these aspects of recovery have to happen in a straight line.From my perspective, the world record for sobriety is 24 hours.Yes, of course there’s value in having 12 years compared with seven days: The cravings have weakened, you’re not sweating through the sheets at night.But I’m not sure time in recovery guarantees that you become a truly empathetic or inspirational person. I know lots of sober jerks, and I know plenty of people who are bettering the world even though they just can’t beat this beast of addiction.Let’s tell the newcomer, “Every day you don’t drink and you don’t use is a victory.”I remember when the idea of going an hour seemed impossible. A day was a victory. And when it took me two years to string together 90 days together in a row, I felt like I was doing it for the first time because I had internalized the shame about relapse. In reality, I had been fighting it for two years, not just 90 days. So I’m not shaming the next person who faces a similar struggle.I hope the toxicology results for Perry, whatever they are, give his family some answers. But all the rest of us need to know is that the world is better off, and more people still live in it, because he was here. Matthew Perry 1, shame 0.Now let’s follow his example and celebrate any 24 hours of sobriety that anyone has.

leoweekly_2023_77,"It might surprise some that, as a professional witch, I used to hate October, especially Halloween. I grew up in New Orleans, a city where even atheists believe in ghosts, and October always felt thick with fright. I’d spend the whole month filled with dread about dying and scared shitless of spirits.It didn’t help that my first real brush with death (my dog, Bootsy happened the October I was 8, or that my first witch ritual at age 10 was on Friday, Oct. 13, and involved trying to raise a dead man buried beneath my friend’s banana tree under the full moon’s light. (I didn’t ask why she thought a body was there. It was her sleepover, her suggested activity. Occultists talk about October as a time when “the veil things,” meaning things from The Other, can cross into our world, with the door swung open completely on Halloween and the two days that follow.This death association makes sense when looking at the natural world. In places that experience winter, October is a time of dying, when nature curls up, while November is the darkest time of the year, with sunlight slipping away each day until the Winter Solstice.But it is interesting that these days, October 31st, November 1st, and 2nd, are kept as a time for ghosts and grief across cultures. In Catholicism, the dates are for the solemn holidays of All Hallows Eve, All Saints Day, and All Souls Day. In Mexico, it’s Dia de los Muertos, a far more celebratory holiday where favorite dishes are left out for departed family members, and graves are cleaned and dressed with flowers. Slavic countries have the autumn Dziady, where extra plates are laid for ancestors to dine, and to the north, the Norse begin to see The Wild Hunt, with ghosts and gods riding in on storms.And, of course, there is the Celtic holiday of Samhain.Most American Halloween is cribbed from Samhain, which traditionally runs from sundown on Oct. 31 to sundown on Nov. 1. It was a marker for the dark half of the year, a time to honor the dead, disguise yourself from malicious spirits by donning costumes, carving frightful faces into turnips and gourds, and play pranks and tell fortunes.For many witches today, Samhain is the highest of holy days. It’s the Witches’ New Year, and with the cosmic portal open, a potent time to do all sorts of workings. In Wicca, it’s when The God dies and goes into the underworld to return with the sun on Solstice. Some Wiccans won’t practice anymagickduring November, considering it a “dead time.”But some of us, myself included, feel that November is when magic is most afoot, precisely because it’s a time of the dead and the liminal.While I’ve made passing comments about being a witch, I’ve never actually said in this column what I believe and how Tarot fits in. So, for the record: I follow The Dark Mother, Hekate, a primordial goddess of many things, including crossroads, ghosts, and liminal spaces, as well as being the bringer of light. She’s an enigmatic figure, equally a dread-goddess and savior, who aids in baneful magick but also guides souls through the underworld with her two torches.As Queen of the Liminal, many modern witches invoke her on Samhain and honor her throughout November. It’s a month not only of death but the journey to rebirth, a Bardo-state for the world, and liminal times are when The Other is most active.Divination is an act that tries to bridge the liminal, and the practice is a large part of my faith. This is how I use Tarot—not as a tool of self-reflection (which it can be but more as a cosmic game of telephone. While Tarot can be read any day of the year, I pay close attention in November, when more nuanced messages can come through.It’s a powerful month to read for others—an act that’s important to how I practice my faith. I’m not just supposed to hoard scraps of secret, celestial knowledge for myself; I’m supposed to work as aPythia,an oracle, and interpret for others.I know that might sound silly, especially with how often I use “fuck” in this column, but I do take your questions very seriously. I genuinely want to help and hope to provide some relief, especially since so many questions deal with grief.Grief is a complex emotion, one that crops up when we not only mourn literal death but metaphorical losses, too. We may mourn the loss of a partner, the loss of a road not taken, the past we didn’t have, or the feeling of a door slamming on a future we so desperately wanted but could not have.It’s not a benign emotion. Grief can kill you, spiritually or bodily. At some point, grief will send each of us to the underworld. I know that this column or even Tarot in general cannot be the torch that guides people out. Grief is too massive.But I try to be a match. I might fail—and often worry that I do—but I’ll still try, with the tools I have, to bring some light.I’m not afraid of ghosts anymore. Working with a chthonic goddess helps, as does having friends who’ve died, who are now welcomed guests when they visit in dreams. All of this leads me to believe in an afterlife, though I’m not sure about semantics. Why do some souls stick around their earthly homes while others get reborn and others still go to a place beyond? Is there a choice in the matter? A determination by heavenly hosts? Are eternal paradises separated by the faiths of the living or is it all one all-inclusive resort? I don’t know. But I hope whenever I go out into the black, that inky swim, there is a light on the shore to guide me through.Dear Oracle,My father passed away almost ten years ago, and I’m still struggling so hard to make a new, normal, fulfilling life for myself. I feel like I’ve been hollowed out, and no amount of new friends, good experiences, or hobbies have helped me to feel like more of a whole person since. I just feel like a shadow of myself. Will this ever get better?Sincerely,Grief-Stricken GeminiCards: King of Cups, Queen of Cups, Nine of Wands (rev. , Knight of Swords, Ten of WandsMy Dearest Gemini,Your father loved you so much. I’m so sorry he’s gone. As King of Cups, he was giving and nurturing, probably a wonderful playmate when you were younger, and someone you could trust and talk to as you grew. He was someone who matched your emotional depth and influenced who you’ve become today.As the Queen of Cups, you are undoubtedly your father’s daughter. But you probably had to become that Queen—the emotionally giving parent—to yourself before you were ready. While you have certainly been the diplomat, forging new friendships and “getting out there,” you may have been too young to tend to the deeper wound.The Nine of Wands is a wind-worn boundary, a wobbly fence of a card. You probably had to erect something around your heart and mind after your father died to get through the initial mourning: the initial shock followed by the funeral planning and bureaucratic bullshit of settling an estate. You probably also formed a shell around everything you associated with your dad as a way to keep his memory fresh. All of that was a protective act, one that let you survive. But after ten years, that wall may need to come down—and with it, a deeper processing of your grief.You asked if this could ever get better, and the answer, honestly, is “it depends.”The Ten of Wands is a burden of a card, one that exhausts and stretches the carrier thin. But it’s a burden that can, shared or halved, be tackled in a variety of ways. You can’t white-knuckle this alone.With the Knight of Swords, honesty and determination are the driving force. You need to be honest about the depth of your grief and if you’ve worked through areas of it. I highly, highly, highly suggest speaking with a grief counselor/therapist (someone your dad would have liked about this. Even if you’ve tried therapy before, other types might help. Maybe you need a Jungian or a Buddhist. Intellectualizing it might help—with all this emotional-water, the airy-heady perspective might appeal to your old Gemini self and give a new perspective.With that help, you might also find yourself able to be the emotional parent to yourself that you needed a decade ago. It’ll be hard work, at times overwhelming and lengthy. But you can be guided out of the underworld, back to the land of the sun, where a King of Cups would want his daughter to be.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_184,"U.S. President Joe Biden pardons the National Thanksgiving turkeys Liberty and Bell during a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on Nov. 20, 2023, in Washington, DC. The 2023 National Thanksgiving Turkey, Liberty and its alternate were raised in Willmar, Minnesota and will be housed at the University of Minnesota after their pardoning. (Win McNamee/Getty Images/TNS As people across the country prepare to celebrate Thanksgiving, a Doris Day quote comes to mind: “Gratitude is riches and complaint is poverty.”She was right, and this week especially, each of us should take a moment to consider the unique history of this quintessential American holiday, what science says about gratitude and how celebrating Thanksgiving can improve your life.Thanksgiving has its roots before the Revolutionary War, of course, but it wasn’t until George Washington’s 1789 proclamation that the holiday officially became a national celebration.Most subsequent presidents dropped the ball on Thanksgiving. Indeed, the holiday was largely forgotten until Abraham Lincoln revived the tradition in 1862, setting it as the fourth Thursday in November from that time forward. Congress set Thanksgiving as the fourth Thursday in November by law in 1941.Thanksgiving, in other words, is like America: It has faced many challenges, but endured through each of them. And that’s a good thing. Researchers at the John Templeton Foundation have uncovered that “in general, more grateful people are happier, more satisfied with their lives, less materialistic, and less likely to suffer form burnout.” Other studies show that more grateful heart patients report better sleep, less fatigue and less inflammation.Grateful people were not only happier and healthier themselves, they also positively influenced others. Giving thanks improves relationships and can even make our homes, our workplaces, and perhaps even our country better places to live.Giving thanks is easier said than done, however, especially in a world where “anger has come to characterize our polarized political environment,” as scholar Patrick Garry has noted. But despite all that there is to be angry about, conservatives especially can’t give up on Thanksgiving. Gratitude is the heart of conservatism, and in the long run, it may even prove to be the virtue that “helps sand off the edges of anger toward those we disagree with” and unite us a country again, as conservative writer Pete Wehner has suggested.This Thanksgiving, then, how can you best use your holiday? You might consider avoiding politics altogether. Politics, which increasingly resembles a contact sport, rarely brings families together and it is hopefully not the most important thing in your life.But what is? This Thanksgiving, perhaps, consider reflecting on the four basic things that the wisdom of the Scriptures, Aristotle and modern social science all indicate lead to human happiness: family, friends, work and religion. Why not focus conversations on these topics, deeply connecting with friends and family?One tried and true way to do that is to count your blessings, literally. It is nearly impossible to make a list of all the things you are thankful for, but it is a great exercise and you’ll end up feeling much better than you did before. While you can certainly do this individually, you might also suggest that everyone around the Thanksgiving table voice what they’re grateful for.If they’re hesitant to share, consider reminding them: “Gratitude is riches and complaint is poverty.”WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
suffolknewsherald_2023_82,"Published 5:57 pm Friday, March 31, 2023ByStaff ReportsPart one of five in a series“Knowledge is power,” is one of the famous quotes, I remember, that’s attributed to English statesman and philosopher, Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626 .If knowledge is power, then it provides information leading to education. It creates changes and reforms. It is a vital force that can save lives. Money and property, too. Indeed, it can be influential, inspiring, and liberating to a point that we’re empowered to be proactive, to be of help to others, to make a difference in the lives of others and to the world.Knowing something we learned from an experience and sharing it with others can be powerful and productive. It can bring positive results in the lives of some, if not many. Hence, I’d like to share with you the following topic or information, which I’m sure you’ve heard about but didn’t pay much attention to.Exploitation. Fraud. Abuse. Scams. Thefts. What subject do they have in common? Or, who is vulnerable or prone to be affected the most in our society?My wife Freny, who retired last year from teaching chemistry in public high schools in Hampton Roads, has recently attended a regular lunch meeting with fellow retired Hampton educators. As usual, she brought me to their lunch meeting knowing that I am an advocate of education and for teachers and students.Being a regular “guest” to their meetings, I got used to becoming familiar with a number of the association’s members and the current president, Joan. Likewise, I have had the opportunity to learn new things, meet people, and have a good time.Besides having catered luncheon, general meeting, updating members what the association’s status is and its projects, and playing bingo with the St. Patrick’s Day theme, one of the highlights of the retired educator’s meeting was having an invited guest speaker, a certified financial planner, Oscar Alvarez, who spoke about issues affecting the financial well being of older adults, particularly the elderly or senior citizens.Given a particular time limit to speak to the retired educators, about 15-20 minutes, Alvarez of Pathway Financial Planning Inc., discussed briefly about financial exploitation, with his objective for the retired educators to be aware and to recognize and reduce the risk of financial exploitation that has been called “the crime of the 21st Century.”Anyone can be the victim of financial exploitation, he said. Financial exploitation crosses all social, educational, and economic boundaries. And so he went on with his talk. Being a listener there, I took notes and did read and research about the topic which is relevant and applicable to us older adults, seniors or elderly citizens, and veterans.What is elder financial fraud or exploitation? It is the fraudulent or otherwise illegal, unauthorized, or improper act or process of an individual that uses the resources of an older person for personal benefit, profit or gain. It is an action that results in depriving an older person of rightful access to, or use of benefits, resources, belongings, or assets.This “epidemic” is under the radar. The cases tend to be very complex and can be difficult to investigate and prosecute. Elders who lose their life savings usually have little or no opportunity to regain what they have lost.Elder financial exploitation can result in the loss of the ability to live independently. It can also result in a decline in health, broken trust, and fractured families.Chris A. Quilpa, a retired U.S. Navy veteran, lives in Suffolk and Chesapeake.

suffolknewsherald_2023_153,"Published 4:57 pm Tuesday, January 17, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardIt’s been said that little good happens after midnight. On the other hand, law-abiding night owls shouldn’t fear for their lives in Suffolk.As reported on today’s front page, six people were wounded in unrelated incidents outside Suffolk restaurants over the weekend — one on the north end of town, the other downtown. Throw in a couple of armed robberies at convenience stores during the same 48-hour period, and it’s clear that the violence that plagued our city in 2022 isn’t subsiding.Police responded to Kickback Jacks, a popular new sports bar and grill on College Drive, at 12:38 a.m. Monday and found a woman suffering from gunshot wounds. Officers learned there were two additional victims already being treated at area hospitals. Two of the three victims were in critical condition.The North Suffolk shooting followed one two nights earlier at High Tide Restaurant on Commerce Street downtown. Three people were injured, two seriously.A citizenry on edge needs some reassurance from city leaders, beginning with Police Chief Al Chandler.As we’ve written in this space before, a community’s top cop doesn’t bear full or even primary responsibility for a crime wave such as Suffolk has experienced since Chandler was named chief. But the community is looking to him for an aggressive response to a problem that is doing immeasurable harm to Suffolk’s reputation and its citizens’ quality of life.Chandler last year announced some worthy initiatives, including installation of portable cameras in hot spots such as the intersection of Saratoga and West Washington streets, gunshot detection technology, and special cameras that capture images of the rear of vehicles. All were proactive and sorely needed.Amid the violent start to 2023, the community needs an update on how those are working and insight on what else is planned to make Suffolk safer.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

leoweekly_2023_20,"I’mnot going to beat a dead horse. We know that the JCPS school bus mess is, well… a mess, but after a conversation with a friend last night, the bus mishap seems just another symbol of a crumbling empire. Our roads are full of holes, bridges tentative at best, schools failing, inflation out of control, maternal mortality the highest of any developed nation (for every 100,000 live births, we lose almost 33 mothers , and yet, elected officials want to talk about abortion, adding guns to schools, and drag story hours. What an embarrassing train wreck. It’s stupid upon stupid.America’s fear of change and development is to our absolute destruction.We see it with the way our jobs have been set up to trap us in servitude for 40 hours or more, and we’ve seen the panic that owners of skyscrapers are having because their staff want to work those 40 hours from home — because they can and more efficiently. We see it with how our learning environments are set up with a lack of flexibility and quality within that flexibility to keep kids engaged and learning. It isn’t that NTI, or other digital learning doesn’t work, it’s that it can’t work in the system we live in.And despite the scattershot of information and issues politicians want us to be angry about, all of these things are intrinsically connected. To fix a piece of the system requires that we adjust and fix the whole thing. Are you willing to do it or are you still worried about bogeymen?With inflexible work lives and a rigid system driven by the needs of capitalism, this empire has some big issues, cannot sustain itself, and while it’s clear the system is failing, some of us who are raising kids in this world aren’t doing a very good job on our part, either. Yes, we’re busy and yes, we’re tired but through all of that, we have a duty to the people we brought into this world to equip them to survive it.This week’s bussing nightmare in Jefferson County was certainly exacerbated by the fact that even while drivers were running behind, many children have no idea of their addresses, phone numbers, or even their parents’ full names.Parental folks, what are you doing?Give your kid the tools to be safe. We can’t place all the blame at the feet of the education system, or bussing, or even Republicans (who we can blame for shitty education budgets when the kids’ first teachers — ahem, parents — have failed to give kids the most basic of information to help them find their way home.Instead of blame, I think collective action is what is necessary to make this school year work better, and to open new pathways to making JCPS a better school system in ways that don’t involve money because we know until state legislators are changed, public school budgets will continue to suffer.I realize that I’m writing this as a parent of a child in a small-town school system in Indiana but I was educated through JCPS. What I also realize is that because of our small town, school parental involvement is somewhat high. Perhaps, it is tougher to get parents engaged in a system as large as JCPS.The one positive from my son’s time at a local Montessori school was the contract for parents to spend 10 hours a year involved in some way helping the school. It was an easy ask. It could have been cooking meals for teachers, cutting paper for the classrooms, cleaning the classrooms. There was something for everyone to do, no matter your schedule.Maybe as JCPS moves forward and figures out the transportation, parents can begin to work together to make the system better for their kids by taking part. It’s a small thing but a step that can shore up a system in crisis while we battle to get the rest of our systems in this nation to move forward and modernize.Last week was a big “L” for JCPS and they have to own it but it doesn’t have to continue to be one for the kids.•*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_47,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.09°It started as a typical rebound relationship. I was drowning in grief, and to say my judgment was impaired is an understatement. Tovi had died two weeks prior, breeding an impulsivity in me that no intervention could interrupt. I was sure adopting another dog would sedate my debilitating pain.The day after he died, I frantically dragged my husband to three shelters and cried when no one came home with us.Tovi was the closest thing to a soulmate I’ve ever had. He was there for me during my tumultuous 20s, and having him as a stable presence forced me to grow up. We lived in nine places, took road trips and hiked countless trails. He walked me down the aisle and gave me away to a man I would later divorce. At my second wedding, in lieu of flowers, I walked down the aisle carrying a bully stick and gently handed it to the “Best Dog.” I grieved not only for Tovi but also the life he had represented, the memories he held. The “before.”I had a checklist. Through Petfinder, I found dogs in foster care meeting my criteria, only to find out that the dog had been adopted. Like a desperate buyer in a seller’s market, my heart sank every time. Racing to yet another shelter, I spotted a volunteer in the parking lot carrying a 5-month-old puppy. Knowing nothing about this dog, other than she broke my age rule, it was as if I yelled, “Dibs!” With my checkboxes blank, I went against my rational intent of making an informed decision. As most rebounds do, Millie seemed good enough.Millie needed to be spayed before her official adoption. Over the days as I waited to take her home, my mind slowed down. My gut screamed I was making a terrible mistake. I was too ashamed to call the shelter and abandon my commitment, so I dismissed the same voice that warned me two weeks before my first wedding not to get married. Once I adopted her, the thought of bringing her back to the shelter was not something I could entertain. I was sure the shelter would put me on some sort of “do not adopt” list and I would never get a dog.My gut proved right. Millie wasn’t the comforting presence I sought. I was an emotional disaster. I needed support. I had nothing to give, yet here I was, responsible for this dog. I’m not sure what part of my grief was worse: the life I lost or the life I would soon be living.Millie felt like an unwelcome intruder; only, I let her in. At home, she was loving. Outside, she was a troubled dog: fearful, aggressive at times, with a noise phobia that quickly ended walks. The blank checkboxes haunted me.On walks, fearful of anyone she didn’t know and unsure of how she would react, I would introduce her from a distance as my “new dog” and not let anyone near her. I would emotionally vomit on strangers about how I had the most incredible dog before her. As if to prove I once had that dog.Millie was a constant reminder of my impulsivity, filling me with resentment at every glance. I went through the motions of being the quintessential dog mom. When the superficial wasn’t helping, I sought months of therapy in hopes of breaking through the invisible fence between us.If we were in a relationship, I would have ended things after realizing we weren’t a good fit. I would tell her, “It’s not you; it’s me,” and mean it with all my heart. I would move on from my rebound, and she would be devastated.Over the years, with the help of behaviorists (and Prozac , Millie made steady progress. I devoted my life to loving her, being her advocate and keeping her from triggers. I was her person from day one. We shared Prozac, literally. Sometimes we borrowed from each other if the other was late on a refill; “Millie owes Liz (x Prozac” is scribbled on the whiteboard in the kitchen.In relationships, I’ve always lived by the motto, “Every time we fall in love, it’s a different experience.” They say you’re lucky if you have one great love in your life. I had that love.Short of five years into our relationship, Millie was diagnosed with cancer. My initial reaction? Ecstatic. I thought about the new dog I would get and how peaceful life would be with that dog. I was then laden with remorse, and the thought passed as quickly as it came. I finally saw her as the dog she’d grown into, not the dog I adopted years ago. She was the dog I couldn’t sleep without. The dog who learned to love hiking. The endearingly shy dog who allowed people to touch her. Despite chemotherapy, Millie died six weeks later. I was devastated, but it would be cliche not to confess that there was also a sense of relief. I no longer carried the fear of liabilities, the forgoing of vacations and the countless “what ifs” that fueled my anxiety.In time, with intention, I will adopt another dog and fall in love in yet another distinct way. For now, the words “Millie owes Liz 8 Prozac” remain on the whiteboard and, perhaps, always will.Elizabeth Weiner is a creative writer who has a master’s in counseling psychology and lives in Maryland.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

eugeneweekly_2023_26,"We ve got issues. There is an article in theChicago Reader by Deanna Isaacs published July 12, titled, “What we talk about when we talk about guns,” that makes the point that gun violence is a redundant term. We don’t talk about bomb violence — bombs are inherently violent. So are guns. Violence is the purpose of guns. If one researches the history that reflects the origin or roots of our nation’s abominable descent into mass shootings — and murderous sprees against school children and other innocent victims — one will find that the gun industry was in a downward spiral as hunting and demand for sporting rifles had plummeted, as did profits. Into the breach stepped the powerful National Rifle Association, which methodically funded what is fairly described as pseudo-scholarship to re-invent the Second Amendment as conferring a personal right to possess firearms as opposed to a right tethered to a well regulated militia. That newly created narrative included the supposed purpose of arming citizens in order to enable them to rebel against the very constitutional government which the Founders were establishing with its checks and balances. This despite the Founders having defined treason as taking up arms against that very government. But this glaring contradiction persisted and found a home within the halls of the Supreme Court, whose collective wisdom may have suffered from the influx of unreported gifts by billionaires to a number of justices weighing in on the question. It is not an exaggeration to describe the resulting decision as one implicating life or death for multitudes of the people who have been tragically impacted by the ruling. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. The industry’s profits soared. The guns that were produced and marketed included versions of the most lethal semi-automatic weaponry developed for the military, designed to kill the most enemy combatants in the shortest period of time. We have gone from sporting rifles to military assault weaponry, from shooting animals to shooting people. We are, in short, hunting each other now as the quarry with ever more powerful guns. A final observation. Stand your ground laws and self-defense rationale as a basis for taking lives are being cited as some sort of 007 license to kill. The law regarding deadly force, however, is not as permissive. A trained law enforcement officer must have probable cause to believe a suspect is a threat to inflict deadly force or serious bodily injury on the officer or others before using deadly force in defense. Very few private gun owners have that training. One can’t shoot at someone just because the person is lost and knocks at the door or drives down the driveway, etc. This is why regulation, training and background checks are necessary. We don’t let people drive a car without passing the required tests. Modern guns are even more dangerous, yet many demand to possess an AR-15 and tote it around without restriction. No sane society would even hope to survive such madness."

If more people volunteered for good causes — whether helping troubled kids, supporting youth sports leagues, improving their neighborhoods or participating in any of countless other altruistic pursuits — communities would have fewer problems, and the world, as they say, would be a better place.Keep Suffolk Beautiful is a great role model.The organization again is leading Suffolk’s participation in the Great American Cleanup, scheduled this year for March 24-25.The organizers make it super easy to participate. Volunteers will receive all necessary supplies, including trash bags, litter grabbers, gloves and safety vests.The Great American Cleanup annually draws more than 1,000 volunteers to make a “clean sweep of the region.” Last year in Suffolk, 235 volunteers donated a combined 630 hours to collect 5,325 pounds of litter and debris.Imagine what’s possible if the number of volunteers doubled this year.“Cleanups are a great way to give back to your city,” said Daniel McDonald, Suffolk’s litter control coordinator, “and it can be a unique way to meet your neighbors and have some fun.”Suffolk City Manager Albert “Al” Moor is leading by example.Moor says he’s heading out on March 24 to take part in the Great Suffolk Cleanup and is authorizing city employees to do the same.“There is no denying it,” Moor said. “Our city has a litter problem. We see it every day as we travel around. I’m encouraging all city staff, organizations, businesses and residents to join me in cleaning up our roadways and neighborhoods. I am personally planning on picking up trash along Wilroy Road and I look forward to everyone choosing their desired location to remove trash.”Groups of four or more people can pick up litter collection kits at Suffolk Litter Control or Suffolk Public Library locations, or call (757 514-7604 or emailksb@suffolkva.usto register.It’s hard to imagine why on earth in the year 2023 there are people who still discard tires on the side of the road and in public parks. And it’s nearly as hard to fathom why folks think it’s appropriate to dump their trash wherever it might seem convenient to do so.In contrast, it’s easy to see why people would want to work to clean up the mess that others leave behind: They care about the world around them and want to leave it in better condition than they found it. That’s the essence of volunteerism and the heart of healthy environmentalism.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2023_173,"Published 7:24 pm Tuesday, October 17, 2023ByJen JaquaOld bridges were getting replaced throughout the city in the ’90s. One bridge in particular stole the headlines throughout the late ’90s. In May, the official wheels went into motion to begin the replacement of the Kings Highway Bridge, a 37-year old structure that crossed the Nansemond River near Chuckatuck. According to Tom Hines, director of public works for the City of Suffolk, the structure accommodated approximately 14,000 vehicles a day and about 150 boats a week. “A lot of this traffic is due to the growth in the northern part of the city, including Virginia Power trucks who use it quite a bit. However, the bridge will only take a maximum of 18 tons of weight,” he said.While bridges over the water were getting replaced, the rivers required upkeep as well. Navigating a boat through the Bennett’s Creek channel was more easily said than done for many boating enthusiasts in July of ’97. While the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the waterway in 1992, ongoing monitoring had put up a red flag for continued passage, indicating the need for a more aggressive plan. Now “a number of citizens as well as businesses that utilize the creek have indicated their concern that the situation is becoming more problematic,” read a city staff report. “There is a concern that if the project is not undertaken before the 2001 time frame, the channel to the creek will be impassable by some boating traffic and will have a negative impact on the residents and businesses in that area.”In October of ’97, ground was broken on yet another new economic development venture. The Bon Secours Maryview Ambulatory Care Center as part of the Harbour View planned development community, was planned to consist of upscale homes, townhouses, condominiums, recreation, and a designated office/business park. The complex will feature an outpatient surgical facility with six operating rooms and a wide range of surgical services.Color filled the skies in April of ’98. The skies over Suffolk were filled with more than 60 colorful hot air balloons.Vaccines weren’t a new thing in 1998, but a person couldn’t do much to prevent getting the chickenpox until a vaccine against that itchy, blistery scourge of childhood was approved in 1995. Three years later, though, the vaccine still wasn’t in wide use, partly because some parents and pediatricians are hesitant to add another shot to the schedule of immunizations that young children already receive.In April 1999, two students in black trench coats swept through suburban Columbine High School in Colorado with guns and explosives. It was by far the bloodiest in a string of school shootings that rocked U.S. communities. The shooting changed the course of school security nationwide.The population of Suffolk had been continuously growing, and housing projects were the topic of conversation. “The time for worrying about a housing explosion in Suffolk is now, city officials say. With single family building permits for the first half of the year nearly doubling those issued in 1998, some Suffolk City Council members say growth isn’t the future—it’s already here. ‘What appears to be a small wave is in fact a tsunami,’ said Councilman Thomas L. Woodward Jr.”1999 came with the Kings Highway Bridge still being discussed and argued over. Plans to replace the Kings Highway Bridge were in flux since state transportation officials said they haven’t decided how tall to make the bridge. The structure, with a swing-span draw, sits about 35 feet above the Nansemond River and has needed replacement for some time. In 1997, the Virginia Department of Transportation proposed replacing the bridge with a 65-foot high structure to eliminate the need for a draw. Malcolm Kerley, a VDOT engineer, said “It’s the height of this new bridge that has drawn criticism from the Bridge Point Farms residents, who say it’ll tower over their property and obstruct their views of the river.”Jen Jaquais the creative director for the Suffolk News-Herald.

eugeneweekly_2023_51,"We ve got issues. I was surprised to seeEugene Weekly’s most recent story on the Eugene School District 4J Board(“Signal Ignites 4J Board Meeting,” Feb. 3 .Most importantly, I want to respond to charges of racist mistreatment made by board member Laural O’Rourke, and recounted in this story, against Board Chair Maya Rabasa and myself. I was originally one of the strongest supporters of board member O’Rourke — because of her intelligence and commitment, the expertise she brought from her work at Lane County and the invaluable insights she brings based on her life experience as a Black woman growing up in Eugene. We agreed on many issues, and we worked together to achieve common goals. I have also learned from board member O’Rourke, and had my eyes opened to some of the myriad and subtle ways that racism plays out, that weren’t all obvious to me from the beginning. There were times when I thought that some things she labeled racist were actually just the same kinds of hostility that I had also faced as a new member. But then I saw that while I was criticized, I was not condescended to; I faced opposition, but was not treated as if I were ignorant. So for me, as a white man, the right response to charges of racism is to take them in, give them time, and consider whether in fact they might be true even if it doesn’t necessarily appear so at first blush. All of this has led me to mostly remain quiet in the face of increasingly harsh attacks by board member O’Rourke against the three other Board members of color — Chair Maya Rabasa, Michelle Hsu and Keerti Hasija Kaufmann — as well as myself and district leaders. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. But I’m at the point where I can’t do that anymore. I’m not going to spend time defending myself, but I do want to set the record straight about Rabasa. Maya Rabasa is the single-most qualified person I know or can imagine to be on this board.She is a former teacher, has three kids in the 4J system, and has spent literally thousands of hours as a volunteer in 4J classrooms — far more than any other member of the board, ever. As a board member and now chair, she works harder and puts in more hours than any other member and any other chair I know of — not just carrying out her official responsibilities but going way above and beyond any normal duties to constantly visit schools, meet with students and staff, and always make herself available to all stakeholder groups who have questions or face personal challenges dealing with the school district. This information is critical to our decision making. Her “Heart of the District” reports given at each board meeting that highlight the exemplary work of a different school district employee — is a testament to how much time and effort she puts in to understanding all the nooks and crannies of how our schools actually operate — in detail, on the ground. And that’s exactly the kind of knowledge that is critical to being able to make smart budget or policy decisions. Rabasa has been an unparalleled leader in acquiring that kind of concrete knowledge and sharing it with the rest of the board and the public. To have her be accused of being a racist, a fascist or compared to the Nazis is shocking, outrageous and offensive. To hear such a person accused of being controlling, condescending or censorious of voices of color is ludicrous and insulting. There has been zero evidence for any of O’Rourke’s accusations leveled against Maya Rabasa. I welcome any opinion and any disagreement about any budget, policy or any other kind of board decision. But there should be no place for these kinds of groundless, personal, toxic public attacks in our board. Above all, the board needs to focus on the work we were elected to do – improving services for students and the quality of education in our schools – rather than interpersonal battles.I’m grateful to have Maya Rabasa leading the board in keeping focused on what matters. Gordon Lafer is co-director of the University of Oregon’s Labor Center and is vice chair of the Eugene District 4J School Board."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_30,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°U.S. democracy is clearly in crisis. It’s entirely possible that in less than two years dissenters will face the power of a government with an authoritarian bent; if that sounds to you like hyperbole, you aren’t paying attention.But is America beyond the political realm also in crisis? Are the very foundations of society eroding? Many people on the right apparently think so. A recent essay by Damon Linker in The New York Times profiled conservative intellectuals whose writing, he argued, helps explain where the MAGA right is coming from. What struck me, reading some of their work, is the dire portrait they paint of the state of our nation.For example, Patrick Deneen’s “Regime Change” describes America thus: “Once-beautiful cities and towns around the nation have succumbed to an ugly blight. Cratering rates of childbirth, rising numbers of ‘deaths of despair,’ widespread addictions to pharmaceuticals and electronic distractions testify to the prevalence of a dull ennui and psychic despair.” And he attributes all of this to the malign effects of liberalism.When I read such things, I always wonder, do these people ever go outside and look around? Do they have any sense, from personal memory or reading, of what America was like 30 or 50 years ago?It’s true that U.S. society has changed immensely over the past half-century or so, and not entirely in good ways: Inequality has soared, and deaths of despair are a real phenomenon. (More about that later. But many right-wing critiques of modern America seem rooted not just in dystopian fantasies but in dystopian fantasies that are generations out of date. There seems to be a part of the conservative mind for which it’s always 1975.Start with those blighted cities. I’m old enough to remember the 1970s and 1980s, when Times Square was a cesspool of drugs, prostitution and crime. These days it’s a bit too Disneyland for my tastes, but the transformation has been incredible.OK, that’s something of a Big Apple-centric view, and not every U.S. city has done as well as New York (although it’s remarkable how many on the right insist on believing that one of America’s safest places is an urban hellscape . Chicago, for example, has done a lot worse. But between 1990 and the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic there was a broad-based U.S. urban resurgence, largely driven by the return to city life of a significant number of affluent Americans, who increasingly valued the amenities cities can offer and were less worried by violent crime, which plunged after 1990.True, some of the fall in crime was reversed during the pandemic, but it seems to be receding again. And Americans are coming back to urban centers: Working from home has reduced downtown foot traffic during the week, but weekend visitors are more or less back to pre-pandemic levels. This doesn’t look like blight to me.What about family life? Indeed, fewer Americans are getting married than in the past. What you may not know is that since around 1980 there has been a huge decline in divorce rates. The most likely explanation, according to economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, is that expanded job opportunities for women led to a temporary surge in divorces as women left unhappy marriages, which receded as marriages adjusted to the new social realities. I take this to mean that during the “good old days” there was a lot of quiet marital misery, some of which is now behind us.Oh, and when we talk about declining birthrates, we should note that a significant factor has been a huge decline in teenage pregnancies, especially among women 15 to 17. Is this an indicator of moral decay?But what about those deaths of despair? They’re real and very much an indictment of our society. But while deaths from drugs, alcohol and suicide happen everywhere, they’re happening disproportionately not in liberal big cities but in left-behind rural regions, stranded by economic forces that have caused a migration of income and employment to relatively well-educated metropolitan areas. If there’s “psychic despair” driving addiction, it seems to be the despair that comes from not being able to get a job — not the despair that comes from a decline in traditional values.Social change is never an unalloyed good thing. I look at how America has changed over my adult lifetime and see some things I don’t like, especially the return to extreme economic inequality. But I also see a society that offers much more individual freedom, especially for women and minorities but for the rest of us too.Not everyone considers this a positive change. Indeed, some people on the right clearly hate the America we actually live in, a complex, diverse nation, as opposed to the simpler, purer nation of their imaginations.And if you would prefer a society with more traditional social relationships, more people practicing traditional forms of religion and so on, that’s your right. But don’t claim, falsely, that society is collapsing because it doesn’t match your preferences or blame liberalism for every social problem.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2023_57,"Theold man, at the end of an expensive dinner attended by campaign donors, foreign dignitaries and policy engineers, fell and cracked his head open.That would normally be the end of an old man. But this old man had fallen in such a way that the back of his skull had split neatly in two, right down the middle, and the resulting fissure was not wide enough for any brains to leak out so long as he lay face down.Since the old man was powerful, the other dinner guests decided they had better do everything they could to help him, so that if he lived (which seemed unlikely he would be pleased with them, or at least not angry. The Chief Interrogator held the left side of his head, while the Special Ambassador held the right, both careful not to get blood on their hands. To give the appearance of being helpful, generic executives held his legs in place until the ambulance arrived.At the hospital, the old man was suspended from the ceiling by seven long straps so that he could breathe, and so none of his gelatinous psyche would be lost. The greatest medical minds in the country came together to discuss what to do with him, and all agreed that it was much too early to sew him back together, so he was left to hang in the air while nurses administered more medications than one would commonly expect, through more tubes than most old men are ever connected to.One of these medicines (there is no consensus as to which one caused a tiny, neon-green shoot to peek out of the crack in the old man’s head. After two days, the shoot had curled itself into something resembling a pale pink coin purse. On the morning of the third day, the purse burst into a bright, flamingo-colored lily, the base of which glowed ghostly yellow.The old man regained consciousness that same day. After accounting for his faculties and being assured of his whereabouts, and after some discussion with the hospital staff concerning the flower growing out of his head, he discovered that he could move objects without touching them. He began concentrating on his tubes, making them swing back and forth, twisting them into loops, even disconnecting one line from its bag after a few days’ practice.Having already exceeded the power normally allotted to old men, the old man, though immobile, was giddy with delight, because he had become even more powerful. This, he thought, was a promethean gift, the edge he needed over his rivals, his assurance that 500-page epics with his face on the cover would fill the shelves of commercial bookstores. By the twenty-first day, the old man had forgotten the humiliation of the lily, which was now in full bloom, filling the stale hospital air with a musk that was like a mixture of patchouli oil and microwaved hot dogs; he had devoted his full attention to developing his new talent. After mastering relatively simple matters, such as moving get-well cards from one nightstand to the other and stretching wires to snag the ankles of unsuspecting orderlies, he decided to try more complicated maneuvers. A failed attempt at making the Prime Minister of New Zealand choke on his water during a live press conference, and an equally ineffectual stab at deflating the attending physician’s tires, led him to deduce that he could only control objects in his immediate vicinity. “No matter,” he thought. “I’ll be released soon, and the world will see.”But he was not released soon, and the world never saw. The lily, now perplexingly enormous, made it impossible to return the old man to an upright position, as it had split his skull even wider. No doctor could tell him for certain whether there was some link between brain flowers and telekinesis, and so he refused to be stitched up. He hung there for an agonizingly long period while medical specialists pondered the safest way to get him upright again.During that time, the old man improved his fine motor skills by assembling elaborate dioramas from uneaten food and other objects in his hospital room: Cheerios and pineapple became playgrounds for his great-grandchildren; Jell-O became vast, sprawling cities of orange marble; edible arrangements sent by congressional staffers were painstakingly picked apart and made into portraits of people who had not yet been born; a thousand grains of rice and loose change were rearranged to make genderless people sunbathing in public parks. After countless hours of practice, he found that he could strip the ink out of newspapers and magazines, allowing him an ashy substance to smear on mirrors or suspend in patterns in the air. One late night, he recreated from newsprint Albert Robida’s “Paris la Nuit,” a futuristic illustration that he had memorized in exacting detail as a boy, on the south wall of his room. The cleaning staff wiped it away while he slept.After nearly six months of makeshift art that grew progressively more detailed with every project, the old man realized he had not placed himself in any of his creations. A week of frustrated experimentation revealed that he could not do so even if he tried. Any attempt to reconstruct a scene from the past, or to invent a future that included his own image, fell apart; sticks and coins would not stay connected, processed foods melted into unrecognizable shapes, inky black dust became a faceless phantom before being scattered by an inexplicable gust of wind.The old man demanded the lily be cut out of his head. The doctors disconnected him from his straps and his tubes, stapled him together, and sent him home. The lily withered and turned brown, as all cut flowers do; a janitor threw it in the trash. No one mentioned the old man’s fall or his hospital stay ever again, not even to ask him how he felt. In a few days, the old man himself had forgotten all about it.•*** ."

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_88,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Abortion opponents aren’t satisfied just getting abortion banned or nearly banned in various states. They want to make it as difficult as possible for people to get help leaving their state to go to another where the procedure is legal.So opponents have been turning their sights on private abortion funds that have been set up in states that prohibit or severely restrict abortion. The funds, which are nonprofits that depend on donations and philanthropic grants, have been a lifeline to pregnant people who cannot afford to travel to a state that allows abortion and to pay for the procedure.Some of these funds, in states with abortion restrictions and bans, have to deal with local officials and state legislators scheming to find ways to shut them down or intimidate them into shutting down. Once threatened, the funds may have little choice but to stop providing funds until they can figure out legally how to proceed. The Yellowhammer Fund filed a lawsuit in July against Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall after he threatened to sue abortion funds or other organizations providing help.The lawsuit argues he has interfered with the Yellowhammer Fund’s constitutional rights as well as those of pregnant Alabama residents who want to exercise their right to travel out of state.Funds in Texas have been particularly imperiled. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision overturning Roe vs. Wade, a group of Texas-based funds brought a lawsuit against the state’s Attorney General Ken Paxton and local prosecutors. The funds allege that state officials had threatened to pursue criminal charges against them for providing resources to people to get an abortion outside the state.Only when U.S District Judge Robert Pitman issued a preliminary injunction in February that stops prosecutors in eight counties from criminally charging abortion funds in Texas did most of them resume providing financial assistance. Still, the abortion opponents managed to slow the funds’ work and that is clearly part of what they wanted.But that injunction didn’t stop the intimidation.One of the defendants in the funds’ lawsuit — Shannon Thomason, the former mayor of Big Spring, one of several Texas cities that declared themselves a “sanctuary for the unborn” — requested, as part of legal discovery, information about the funds’ donors, staff, volunteers and the names of doctors who have provided abortion care to Texans out of state.Thomason also asked each fund to identify the date of every abortion they have facilitated since Sept. 1, 2021.This is another outrageous attempt to rattle reproductive rights advocates.It would provide information to people who may try to target donors or staff under the notorious Senate Bill 8, which allows private citizens to sue people for helping Texans get an abortion.The funds’ lawyers have filed for a protective order against having to answer any of these invasive questions, arguing that this information is constitutionally protected.The Supreme Court decision overturning Roe vs. Wade said states could decide whether abortion was legal in their states. It did not make pregnant people captives of their state legislators and state prosecutors.— Los Angeles TimesHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_67,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Those of us who write about higher education can pay too much attention to America’s elite universities. Schools including Harvard, Yale and Stanford are seen as virtual cultural superpowers, and the battle over these schools is sometimes seen as a proxy for battles over the future of the country itself. It’s not that this argument is wrong, exactly. That’s why I’ve written about these schools. But it’s incomplete.In rightly ascribing importance to the Harvards of the world, we can forget that other schools in other contexts also exercise immense influence, and their virtues and flaws can sometimes be more consequential than anything that happens in the Ivy League.In fact, I’d argue that the moral collapse at Liberty University in Virginia may well be the most consequential education scandal in the United States, not simply because the details themselves are shocking and appalling, but because Liberty’s misconduct both symbolizes and contributes to the crisis engulfing Christian America. It embodies a cultural and political approach that turns Christian theology on its head.Last week, Fox News reported that Liberty is facing the possibility of an “unprecedented” $37.5 million fine from the U.S. Department of Education. The department has been investigating violations of the Clery Act, a federal statute that requires federally funded colleges and universities to publicly report data about campus crime. To put that number into perspective, consider that Michigan State University paid $4.5 million for its own “systemic failure” to respond to the infamous Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, in which Nassar was convicted of sexually abusing dozens of women in his care. While Liberty’s fine is not yet set, the contents of a leaked Education Department report — first reported by Susan Svrluga in The Washington Post — leave little doubt as to why it may be this large.The report, as Svrluga writes, “paints a picture of a university that discouraged people from reporting crimes, underreported the claims it received and, meanwhile, marketed its Virginia campus as one of the safest in the country.” The details are grim. According to the report, “Liberty failed to warn the campus community about gas leaks, bomb threats and people credibly accused of repeated acts of sexual violence — including a senior administrator and an athlete.”A campus safety consultant told Svrluga, “This is the single most blistering Clery report I have ever read. Ever.”If this was the only scandal at Liberty, it would and should be a national story. But it’s not the only scandal. Far from it. I’ve been following (and covering Liberty’s moral collapse for years, and the list of scandals and lawsuits plaguing the school is extraordinarily long. The best known of these is the saga of Jerry Falwell Jr. Falwell, a former president of the school and a son of its founder, resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct involving himself, his wife and a pool attendant turned business associate named Giancarlo Granda.Falwell is nationally prominent in part because he was one of Donald Trump’s earliest and most enthusiastic evangelical supporters. Falwell sued the school, the school sued Falwell, and in September, Falwell filed a scorching amended complaint, claiming that other high-ranking Liberty officers and board members had committed acts of sexual and financial misconduct yet were permitted to retain their positions.But that’s not all. In 2021, ProPublica published a comprehensive, gut-wrenching report describing how Liberty mishandled claims of sex abuse and sex harassment on campus and used its strict code of conduct, the Liberty Way, against victims of sex abuse. If, for example, victims had been drinking or engaged in any other conduct prohibited by Liberty policies, those details in their sex abuse complaints could be used against them in school disciplinary proceedings.Liberty has faced a series of lawsuits related to those claims, and last year it settled one of those cases. Throughout these controversies, Liberty has responded by denying many of the worst allegations against it. Liberty claims, for example, that the Education Department’s preliminary report is marred by “significant errors, misstatements and unsupported conclusions.”It has also acknowledged “historic gaps in compliance” with the Clery Act and says it is making material changes on campus, including spending millions to upgrade campus security and reviewing and enhancing its Title IX procedures.I know that there are people who will read the accounts above and be angry. They can’t believe a Christian institution could fail its students, the church and the nation so profoundly. Others will read and grow angry for a different reason. The scandals above are only a partial description of the problems at Liberty. They’ll actually think I let the campus off easy.But there’s another group that will be angry as well — at yet another attack on an evangelical institution in a powerful secular newspaper. That anger, though, is a key part of the problem with the American church, and it’s a problem that no less a Christian figure than the apostle Paul identified almost 2,000 years ago.In his first letter to the Corinthian church (or, as Trump might say, One Corinthians , he issued a ferocious denunciation of sexual immorality inside the church. In Chapter 5, he says that he’s heard of misconduct “of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate.” He’s condemning an act of incest within the church, but if you read the accounts of incidents at Liberty, you’ll read stories of gross misconduct that Christians and non-Christians alike should and do find utterly abhorrent.The chapter continues in an interesting way. Paul demonstrates ferocious anger at the church’s internal sin, but says this about those outside the congregation: “What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge those outside. ‘Expel the wicked person from among you.’”Not every Christian institution is rocked by scandal, and there are many Christian colleges that are healthy and vibrant, led by men and women of integrity. Yet as we witness systemic misconduct unfold at institution after institution after institution, often without any real accountability, we can understand that many members of the church have gotten Paul’s equation exactly backward.They are remarkably tolerant of even the most wayward, dishonest and cruel individuals and institutions in American Christianity.At the same time, they approach those outside with a degree of anger and ferocity that’s profoundly contributing to American polarization.It’s also perpetuating the corruption of the church.Under this moral construct, internal critique is perceived as a threat, a way of weakening American evangelicalism. It’s seen as contributing to external hostility and possibly even the rapid secularization of American life that’s now underway. But Paul would scoff at such a notion. One of the church’s greatest apostles didn’t hold back from critiquing a church that faced far greater cultural or political headwinds — including brutal and deadly persecution at the hands of the Roman state — than the average evangelical can possibly imagine.Why? Because he realized the health of the church wasn’t up to the state, nor was it dependent on the church’s nonbelieving neighbors. Liberty University is consequential not just because it’s an academic superpower in Christian America, but also because it’s a symbol of a key reality of evangelical life — we have met the enemy of American Christianity, and it is us.© 2023 The New York Times CompanyHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

How can I survive this position until something better comes along?-Looking for Greener PasturesCards: Knight of Cups (rev , Ace of Pentacles (rev. , The Hanged Man (rev. , Waning GibbousDear Green,This damn Waning Gibbous is screwing everything up. It’s a card about letting go and comes at the very end of the spread, which makes for two possible but completely opposite interpretations. The whole spread either means A. “Start doing this and let go of expectations” OR B. “Stop doing these things.” And unfortunately, they both seem like reasonable answers to me in this context.So here are the two possibilities:A. For this job, I think you need to “play the game” a little more. It would be great if work was really based on merit, but often, it’s not; it’s based on connections. With the emotionally intelligent Knight of Cups next to the work-work-work Ace of Pentacles, I think you might need to work on your networking a bit more. With The Hanged Man, I think you might be misunderstood in your company and feel like you’re putting in much effort without reward. It might be because your boss doesn’t see it, for whatever reason (personal bias? Kind of spacey? Large company? , so it might help to make a more solid impression. However, if you make more of an impression, that might help with your growth. For the Waning Gibbous, you have to let go of the idea that your hard work will be the only thing that matters. Networking isn’t fun for many people—it can feel braggy or artificial—but personal relationships can carry you far.B. This might be a job that you need to let go of. With the only Major Arcana being the sacrificial Hanged Man, you might be martyring yourself for no good reason. Having three reversed cards might suggest that you’ve been trying to put in a good effort, be a team player (Knight of Cups , and keep your eye on the prize (Ace of Pentacles , but this might be the best it gets. With the releasing energy of the Waning Gibbous, you might need to let go of these actions and stop sacrificing for this job—and really start looking for another.I’m unsure which way you’re leaning, but hopefully, one of these makes sense. You might even marry the two and start networking more in order to find a better job. I do know that something has to change—you aren’t happy and the current avenue isn’t providing many opportunities—so you could try path A first and, if that feels wrong, head down path B.I’m sorry I’m not able to provide a more precise answer.Best of luck.Dear Oracle,I know it’s cliché, but I’d like to have a better relationship with my husband’s parents. Things aren’t bad… they’re just not very warm. Any advice for improving relations with the in-laws?-Daughter-in-lawCards: King of Cups, Queen of Wands, Six of Swords, The Hermit (All reverse. Dear Daughter,Since writers were making overbearing mother-in-law jokes in Ancient Rome, one might guess that in-law drama has been around for about as long as marriage has. It might be cliché, but that doesn’t mean there haven’t been plenty of people who have felt like you over the centuries.With all these cards in reverse, I’m guessing this has been an issue for years rather than something creeping up now.Starting off the King of Cups, I bet you want to improve relations for your husband’s sake. Maybe he has a dreamy idea that all of you could be a happier family, and you would like to make that true. But, this relationship is between you and your in-laws—and in reality, there’s little that he can do.You mention that the relationship isn’t very warm, and as the Queen of Wands, that warmth needs to come from your side. You might have to be the generous and giving one, even if they don’t make as much effort in return, and you have to accept that imbalance. It’s not ideal but it may help. But remember: the Queen of Wands can be fiery, so be mindful not to torch any bridges if you feel slighted.However, the Six of Swords reminds us that relationships are a two-way street. It can be a card of transition and change; if you all want to move forward, that can happen. But, if someone is holding a grudge or just not interested, then there’s only so far that boat can float.The Hermit is the only Major Arcana here, and I think it’s doing some heavy lifting. It can be a card of a strong inner life and being misunderstood by outsiders. It’s possible that you and your in-laws may be missing something about each other that can hopefully be rectified with conversation and mutual growth. But The Hermit is also a reminder that we have but one life on this earth and to live it wildly. If you try and try and your in-laws don’t want to be kind to you, let go of the dream (or your husband’s dream that things will be better. You can judge how much energy you want to put into being civil with them and maintaining a cordial relationship. (I do recommend you aim for cordial simply because your husband loves them and loves you, and that makes it easier for all parties. But you don’t need to go out of your way to deepen your relationship if you think they have no interest. Just show up to Thanksgiving with a pie and light-hearted conversation and leave it at that. A deep relationship would be wonderful, but if it’s not on the table, don’t lose yourself trying to find it. ( ."

suffolknewsherald_2023_132,"Published 4:09 pm Tuesday, February 7, 2023ByJen JaquaAs the calendar turned to 1933, it proved to be a big year nationwide and locally, as it was the turning point of the Great Depression and saw improvement in the economy. Unemployment was down, family income was up and alcohol was back. Suffolk saw much building and economic growth. With this growth came increased charity and community participation.Local headlines provide a brief look at what life was like here in Suffolk.Bears roamed the Dismal Swamp then as they do now. Twenty-five of them had been hunted as of Jan. 21, proving to many skeptical that the bear population was still healthy in the swamp.A Feb. 1 story, “Start Suffolk Hour over radio station,” announced that WGH Newport News had an hour-long Suffolk program sponsored by local merchants and manufacturers three times a week at 9 a.m. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Local talent was to be featured on the show.In March, President Roosevelt, in an attempt to revive citizens’ trust in the banking system, shut banks down for four days. No transactions were completed, not even payroll. However, it seems based on the multiple stories over the four days that Suffolk was largely unaffected and business went on as per normal. One story even mentions that the city charity group was prepared to assist any needing it. Once reopened, banks were instructed to “prepare a list of hoarders of gold and gold certificates in this community so that Uncle Sam can publicly point his long index finger at them in the same scornful manner as slackers were pointed out during the late hostilities.”On March 16, Amedeo Obici was nominated as Rotary president. The Suffolk Rotary has long served as a community organization.Every day, a new front-page story appeared about Hitler and his Third Reich. On March 24, a large banner headline claimed, “Denies Jews are being persecuted.” The story goes on to talk about the inquiries and investigation into rumors of thousands being killed. While Suffolk and the rest of the United States enjoyed a rebound from some dark days, worse times were building overseas.On June 22, the Suffolk News-Herald began the Milk and Ice Fund. The fund was supported by donations from citizens of Suffolk allowing milk — as well as ice, to keep the milk cold — to be delivered to families of babies who were in financial distress. The milk came from a local dairy, and the ice was from a local ice plant. The decision to start the fund came after the discovery of 50-100 homes of infants unable to afford the needed milk. The Milk and Ice Fund was based off of a similar program ran in New York by Mrs. William Randolph Hearst. This fund, one of many started by the paper over the years, was the definition of community, supported by citizens to help citizens. The Suffolk News-Herald is proud to continue the tradition of community to this day with our Cheer Fund and multiple other community relations projects.I would love to hear from anyone who may have been involved with the Milk and Ice Fund or has heard of it through family stories.On Sept. 1, two momentous stories bannered the front page. The council approved a $10 tax per year on beer retailers. The return of alcohol to the country was greeted with a money-making opportunity for the city. The other headline read: Child labor ended today in America. Meanwhile, listed in the building permits issued for that week was a permit for an outhouse to be built on West Washington Street. Estimated cost: $28.In late October, the Suffolk Retail Merchants Association, formed by 72 leading retail firms in the city, participated in a window display arrangement to promote the purchase of local products. The movement was to encourage consumerism and boost the local economy in the months leading up to Christmas.On Dec. 5, Prohibition ends. Alcohol is back.On Dec. 16, the Milk and Ice Fund got a substantial boost as the Pitts Amusement Co. agreed to donate all profit from the showing of “Berkeley Square” for two days at the Chadwick Theater. The plea was made for all citizens to attend to see a show and give extra for the children for Christmas. The show brought in $66.70.The Suffolk Production Credit Association formed Dec. 28. It covered five counties, providing loans to eligible farmers. P.A. Goodwyn stated at the organizational meeting that loans were to be made with sufficient collateral. It did not make crop production loans or unsecured loans, nor was it a charity organization.Business and community were growing at exponential levels. Peanuts were the dominating product, but other agriculture and manufacturing of all sorts were starting up in Suffolk. With a city on the rebound and growing, the future looked bright.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

eugeneweekly_2023_10,"We ve got issues. Mahatma Gandhi made a statement: “The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.” What changes need to take place in Lane County to make it a safe place for animals? 1. Landlords/owners/property managers need to enforce pet policies in their rentals, trailer parks, apartments, etc. In the last few months there have been animal hoarding situations that Eugene Animal Services, Greenhill Humane Society and other rescues have been involved in. More than 30 cats were recently taken from an abandoned apartment. These animals are the lucky ones — someone cared enough to report them so the authorities could get them out of their filthy and inhumane situation. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. But issues like this should not be happening. Landlords/owners/managers need to have pet policies in place for their properties and enforce them. If pets are allowed — how many? They must be altered with proof of same in their files. Any pets outside will be on leash, in a fenced yard or in a catio. There will be an inspection two to three times a year. And the rules will be enforced. There is information online regarding Oregon laws about pet lease agreements for rentals. And I’m sure the local authorities such as Lane County Animal Services, your city’s animal control, or the police can give you specifics for your location. 2. Everyone gets their pets altered. If everyone got their pets altered, there would not be unwanted litters, people desperate to give away puppies and kittens and so many dumped animals. There are a number of resources for financial assistance for altering cats and dogs. 3. Springfield desperately needs an animal shelter, instead of depending on small rescues with very limited funds to help all the animals in need. Springfield has a population of around 62,000, but no animal shelter to help care for the strays in the community. Yes, there is Springfield Animal Services, which basically deals with dog situations. Cats are a huge issue. Small rescues with very limited resources deal with hundreds of phone calls regarding cats in Springfield city limits. It would be wonderful if the city stepped up to help in this situation, perhaps a community focused organization, such as the Chamber of Commerce, or a group of concerned citizens to create a shelter or resource in Springfield. 4. The veterinary community combines forces. If each clinic were to offer so many free spay/neuter appointments one time a year for feral cats and/or pets of low/no-income folks, it would make a huge impact. If every veterinary clinic in the Eugene/Springfield vicinity would commit to doing 10 free spay/neuter of feral cats during the year, it would make an impact. They could work with the existing rescues to funnel the cats in on the day set aside. Either the cats could be worked in during regular work days, or a weekend day set aside, with staff volunteering their time. Each clinic could be responsible for only one week or weekend per year. This is a problem that can be solved, provided we all work together. Think about the quote from Gandhi — where is Lane County at? And what areyoudoing to make it better?"
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_71,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°Idea for downtownHilo homelessnessIdea for downtownHilo homelessnessHere’s an answer called the Homeless Intervention Detention Program.With the support of the courts, homeless individuals will be subject to a 90 day-intervention option as a result of arrest, conviction or plea bargain.The Homeless Intervention Detention Program will be a boot camp of sorts for the homeless. They will be provided medical diagnosis, and alcohol-, drug- and tobacco-free lodging. Their monthly stipend will be used to help to defer the cost.By removing the incentives of alcohol, drugs, tobacco and cash, many of the participants would likely accept the offer of a free mainland plane ticket.Those with mental illness problems would be treated and medicated. Offering mandatory training classes in life skills, required grooming, dental hygiene and a variety of other options would be provided by the staff.About half of the homeless have mental illness issues. They get help and required medication for their problems. At least for 90 days.About a quarter of the homeless enjoy the lifestyle. The incentives of alcohol, drugs, tobacco and cash is a path of least resistance. Take that away.About a quarter of the homeless would like to change and reintegrate into society. We can help do that. The program adapts itself to all of these needs.The program would be by merit. You miss classes or make a problem, and you sit on a chair all day. You get the meal of the day with no substitutes or additional dishes. You participate, and you are rewarded.Daily exercise would be another component, and all television viewing would be online behavioral modification classes. Beautification projects, with a broom and a rake, (anywhere but downtown where they might get drugs keeps them active and healthier. You get the picture?While the productive members of society would consider this to be a positive lifestyle intervention, a fair share of the homeless would consider it to be an absolutely unacceptable deterrent. No alcohol, drugs, tobacco or pocket cash removes the incentive for being homeless. That’s an excellent result.It will require bridging between the county public safety officers and the state Judiciary. Providing intervention as a form of incarceration would please both the court and the public safety officers. Properly administered, it will reduce the prison population and lower the fixed costs by utilizing alternative accommodations reasonably equivalent to boot camp.The expectation is that a second 90-day intervention for repeat offenders would be motivation to accept our offer for a plane ticket. With the state of Hawaii the very worst state for mental health services, returning to family members on the mainland is a positive option. Better care would be provided anywhere in the mainland.Lacking proper identification, a letter for airport security and escorting them to their seat would assure better care with family members on the mainland.We have to do something! Otherwise, it’ll be time to bulldoze downtown pretty soon.We know the tiny homes projects don’t work. They are far too problematic for nonprofit agencies to manage.This idea, combined with many 90-day sentences, at least approaches the problem from a direction far better than a prison cell. And done well, it should be cheaper.Don’t just talk about a problem, do something about it! Think it over. This idea could work.Michael MamczarzKurtistownKudos to reporterfor energy articleI just wanted to say the article, “Energy strategy questioned,” by Michael Brestovansky (Tribune-Herald, Oct. 18 I thought did a great job of covering the important facts that Mike Ewall delivered and explained it well.We should be using energy that is green and proven to be viable, as well as using proven strategies to reduce waste.Sunny Seal-LaPlantePepeekeo"
leoweekly_2023_16,"Hello.My Name is Rose Boyle. In 1955, I was Sister John Bosco, an Ursuline nun on her first mission assigned to Our Mother of Sorrows parish. I left convent life in 1962, am now 88 years old. Recently, I was remembering my first mission, and I thought if I visit Louisville, I want to see where I lived next to the “call house.” Then I googled to get the address, and to my amazement, I found the research and story ofAnna the Madam by Lisa Pisterman. I am gratified to know that the call house has been changed into a “house of healing” for vulnerable women.Enclosed is a recounting of a little incident that happened my one and only year at Our Mother of Sorrows. I enclose it for your amusement. It is true according to my memory but I have changed the names of the nuns. Thank you for your research and true story. If I do travel to Louisville, I will visit the site of the “healing house.”The Nuns and the BrothelThe year is 1955. I am twenty years old, recently out of the novitiate and assigned to my first mission where I will live with 12 other nuns and teach fourth and fifth grades.One afternoon Sister Elise and I exit the front door of our convent and begin walking to our classrooms. We are carrying supplies for the coming term. As we walk along the sidewalk past the adjacent house, I get a glimpse of several scantily-attired ladies, fanning themselves and lounging lazily on their front porch swings. Looking straight ahead, trying to practice “custody of the eyes,” I sense their amused regard of us.It is a hot sultry August afternoon in Kentucky. Sister Elize and I are garbed in reams of black wool, muslin undergarments and skirts, stockings, cardboard bonnet with veils, linen gimps and headbands so that only a part of our faces and hands are exposed to air. We are a total contrast to the “ladies.”The layout is this. At the corner of our street is our convent, a large two-story house with many small bedrooms, a front porch and back door leading to a long grassy yard. Adjacent and parallel is the ladies’ house, very similar in appearance, two stories, back exit with long grassy yard. Next, is the two-level brick school, extending from the sidewalk back to the alley. Then the church and beside it, the pastor’s house. These five buildings are parallel and extend from sidewalk to alley. Usually, we nuns exit our back door, walk through the grassy yard to the alley where we turn right and walk along the alley to either the school or church. As we walk through our yard, we can see the ladies next door sunning themselves in lounges scattered about their garden of flowers and shrubs. Sister Elise cautions me not to look. I come to grasp somewhat what is going on next door with all the cars parked, coming and going all hours. However, I entered convent life after eighth grade at age 14, so I’m quite ignorant about the ways of the world.My classroom faces the ladies garden, so I have been advised to shutter the windows when the ladies are sunning lest my students witness something out of Hieronymus Bosch’s painting “Garden of Delights” (The Garden of Earthly Delights .We are so busy with teaching, prayers, and household chores that we give little thought to our unusual neighbors.One night, I’m asleep in my small bedroom. The wake up bell is ringing, but it’s way too early, scarcely midnight. I don a robe, exit my room and see the other sisters exiting and questioning what is happening. We proceed to the living room where our Sister Superior (manager appears without her cap and teeth, and seems quite agitated. She informs us that Sister Serita has just had a terrifying experience, that she was asleep in her second-level bedroom, had the window raised to get some evening breeze when a man’s arm and leg started coming through the window. He was calling, “Let me in, Margaret!”Sister Serita tried to push him out and then fled the room, wakened the house. Sister Superior announces, “We have called the police who will inspect our rooms and yard for any intruder.”Just then, two policemen enter and call “all clear.”Later, there’s a knock at the door and two detectives enter. They listen gravely to Sister Superior’s story, keep serious faces, and say they will go next door to investigate. We all go back to bed.Next morning, on my way to school, I notice our pastor with several workers. They are tearing down the lattice work and vines beneath Sister Serita’s bedroom and inspecting all the windows. We forget about this incident expect that occasionally, Sister Elise will try to get a giggle from me by whispering, “Let me in, Margaret!”•*** ."
suffolknewsherald_2023_165,"Published 4:39 pm Tuesday, January 3, 2023ByStaff ReportsMy daughter gave me a T-shirt for Christmas with these words on it: “NORMAL isn’t coming back… JESUS IS!”It is such a great message The Bible promised it and I believe it (John’s gospel .Each day when I listen to the recounted news I think of biblical happenings, truths as Israel faced the life God had promised through Abraham. There are comparisons to the times in which we are now living. I have had many, mostly good, “normal” times in my life but some that left me hurting, having to depend wholly on God for strength and the desire to keep going, knowing others were dependent on my care and help.I needed and found a well of faith. At my age, almost 95, I know the Bible is God’s word for us.This morning I read from my friend’s devotional book where she writes how some numbers in Scripture — 3, 12, 40, 400 — have special meaning. The number 40 was jumping out for me. I was 40 in 1968 when the most difficult experience of my family’s life took place. I won’t recount the details, but note that it was the presence of God that upheld and kept me able to trust the one who promised to be with his children.I was alone, their dad on the plane for Chicago, when I got the news our oldest son and brother Jim had been in an unprovoked attack while riding their bicycles on the only street to get home. The injury to my son was unbelievable, leaving him with a serious visual handicap that would last all his life.Where was God? It’s a question which plagues so many people.I can say God was there for me. I was wrapped in the words Jesus spoke in his sermon on the mount, “If you forgive not others, neither will your Father in heaven forgive you.”These young angry boys needed forgiveness and on behalf of what scripture had taught me, I offered it. I do not know what it meant to the boys, but I know what it meant to many people and to our family even if some response was unforgiveness, another that I was “out of it” to forgive.My beloved was on a plane. I was alone. I had to be strong. People all over the world who knew us as missionaries were helping us by their prayers. After their dad returned and understood the entire story, our personal relationship seemed to go into a meltdown. It would be many years later when I understood the reason. He told me he had been unable to forgive the boys. Thankfully the “restorer” had not left himself without a witness. The day of forgiveness came and today I know it was God who answered all those prayers in his time and for his glory. God’s presence and his promise were validated for me. He is a God who makes good on his promises.This morning I asked God to let me feel His presence today. I feel a darkening curtain is falling over our whole world. My concern is for the young growing up, often without this assurance of God as “a very present help in times of trouble.”My morning routine is worship, prayer and “meditation,” sometimes searching out some scripture that comes to mind. I may be looking out the window, but not distracted, just “thinking” and when someone or something comes to mind, I pray for that person or for that “thing.”I am currently taking a page a day from our new church directory, reading the names and praying for them. I don’t recognize most of them, many a part of the church before my time. Obviously, the church was important in the past. Many activities centered around the church. As the years passed, people moved away, may have lost touch and we had COVID-19 that left many happy to sit comfortably at home and listen online.My prayer is that any who may not have seen or felt the need of church fellowship will return and find “new life” as we come together around the eternal word of God.The last day of 2022 is now half over. I have shared a part of my heart with some of you, my loving friends. May the year 2023 find all of us faithful, loving God and his word more than ever, trusting his promises when and if what seems to be a darkening cloud should settle over us. God is omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent. We can trust him fully.Myrtle V. Thompson is a lover of God, retired missionary, writer and author.

eugeneweekly_2023_47,"We ve got issues. It wasn’t particularly surprising when Gov. Ron DeSantis made critical race theory (CRT enemy No. 1 in the culture wars. That is precisely the kind of reaction that CRT predicts as part of the systemic racism of our institutions. To be clear, it is fair to debate whether CRT is a valid theory that accurately depicts the history of racism in our society, just as one might debate whether quantum theory accurately depicts what we know about physics. That is what education is for. Most in this country do not support Marxism, yet we do not ban the teaching of Karl Marx. So, I have to ask, why fear the teaching of CRT? In her response to Pres. Joe Biden’s State of the Union address, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, citing CRT, claimed that “Our children are taught to hate one another on account of their race.” Hello. Teaching the truth about racism in our history is not teaching hate. To the contrary, the failure to teach that truth is to be silent on what the Rev. Jim Wallis calls America’s “original sin” and only perpetuates systemic injustice. Most theories that challenge the status quo create controversy, so the pushback is not surprising. I was surprised, however, when this particular cultural war expanded to include DEI programs (diversity, equity and inclusion . DeSantis has proposed not only to ban CRT from all public schools in Florida, he is now going after DEI programs. This politicization of DEI is both alarming and disturbing. Racism does not care if you are Republican or Democrat. Ignoring it will not make it go away. Pretending that we can all just be “colorblind” and treat everyone the same does not correct the enormous imbalance from centuries of systemic racism. DEI programs are absolutely essential to begin the healing of racism’s scourge on society. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Two examples from my own personal story show why we need DEI programs, especially in schools. I grew up in Albany, just 45 miles north of Eugene. I thought I had a good education. What did I learn about Native Americans in Oregon? For all I knew, they all lived on the Warm Springs Reservation. That there remained a significant Native American community in the Willamette Valley was never mentioned. Worse, the big event of the Oregon Trail involving Native Americans that I was taught concerned the massacre of the Whitmans in 1847. No mention was made of the mistreatment of the local people by those missionaries. Nor did I learn that three of those eventually executed for the massacre were not even involved in it. How richer and more accurate would my education have been had we had the DEI programs that now exist and might have introduced me to more accurate portrayals of the original inhabitants of this valley and their descendants still among us? The second story is particularly embarrassing to me now. My sophomore year in high school was spent with 1,900 fellow students in a building intended for 1,200. We were all relieved the following year when Albany opened its second high school in the south part of town. The school board asked for the opinions of the students for naming the school. I still remember the impassioned plea of our chosen representative who said whatever name you chose, just do not name it “South Albany.” Our preference was to name it after Neil Armstrong. What did the school board choose? You guessed it, South Albany. “But you can choose your mascot and school colors,” they said. How nice. What did we choose? The Rebels. Our colors? Red and gray. Our band uniforms included a Confederate flag on the top of our hats. It is not that we intended to promote the racism of the Confederacy, it was that we were pissed with the school board and this was our means of rebellion. Did any of the adults of that town, including our parents, say to us, that is not an appropriate mascot? Nope. Can you imagine how it looked to any people of color when our band marched on Veterans Day proudly down the streets of Albany in our Confederate uniforms? South Albany remained the Rebels for 45 years before the mascot was finally changed to the Red Hawks in 2018. It takes a long time to undo the effects of racism, even if unintentional. Racism can only begin to be healed when we, the white majority, are honest with our history and work for diversity, equity and inclusion for all.

leoweekly_2023_41,"We’reat the end of May which is something that I find hard to believe. This year is flying by, and to be honest, Imma need it to slow down. I have a milestone birthday coming and I am not ready to cross that bridge into the Geritol years and colonoscopies. What I am glad about, this May, is that this issue brings something fresh, and acts as a perfect bridge to the next issue. This time we offer a nod to another local publication, The Portland Anchor, a deep dive with singer/actor Billy Porter before his upcoming Louisville show, and a news story about the challenges of Louisville’s new Jail Population Dashboard.As you read more about the Dashboard, I implore you to go to the Louisville Metro website and try to use it for yourself. First, finding the way into the dashboard itself is a difficult task, and then making sense of how the data is presented, even after watching the video, takes some challenge.In the story, I spoke with several of the community members and activists who’ve worked on this dashboard, and are now actively using it for data tracking. The problems that I had seem to be a common complaint, and my hope is that the Louisville Metro Department of Corrections takes seriously the concerns and questions the community is raising about this dashboard. It serves no one to withhold information or to present the information in a biased way. At the end, the goal should be the same — basic observation of human rights while people are housed at LMDC.I’ve written before about having an issue with how we use our system of corrections for solely punitive means. American justice is not truly concerned with justice, but penalization and dollars. Sometimes, we penalize the wrong things for the sake of money. For instance, according to the court status in the dashboard, many of the individuals incarcerated at LMDC are there because of small bonds, less than $500 or $1000. Generally, low bonds mean low-risk crimes. Many have also been there for more than a week, and likely, because of the low bonds, they presents no danger. So while our jail claims to struggle with overcrowding, there are people who could be out of the jail population but simply don’t have the funds to post their bond, even if that bond is low. So they are held in jail, filling space, and giving LMDC license to charge taxpayers for their care.If it seems like a racket, I feel that it kind of is. Tax money is reliable. Holding a low-bond inmate and drawing tax dollars seems to have been working out as a nice budget boost for many municipal jail systems. What happens if the public understands this? If the public could easily access and understand the Jail Population Dashboard, this money haven might come to an end. Maybe then low-risk populations could go home, serve house arrest or community service, and save the available jail space for prisoners who seem to need more restriction.The dashboard brings some hope that Mayor Greenberg is offering more transparency but until we see the dashboard functioning at the capacity it could, I think the skepticism is justified. Improving the dashboard, and giving citizens a way to understand how and why people are incarcerated is important for the taxpayer and the safety of those incarcerated.• ( ."
philinquirer_2023_6,"Much of Philadelphia s civic persona is tied to being an embattled long shot. But what happens when an Eagles victory is not just hoped for, but expected? The Philadelphia Eagles, you may have heard, will play forthe championship of the National Football League in the Super Bowl Sunday evening, carrying not just the hopes of an entire region that has known its share of sports disappointments, but also bearing the relatively unusual weight of expectation. For a city whose default civic persona is that of the embattled underdog — cue themontage of Rocky sprinting up the Art Museum stepsin search of a side of beef to tenderize with his bare knuckles — standing on the precipice of a great accomplishment as afavoriteis both dizzying and somehow untrustworthy. (Note to Rocky: The beef is kept with the post-Impressionists. Preferring life as an underdog is a coat Philadelphia claims to wear well, if only to protect it from the cold wind of disappointment. Hemmed in by more glamorous and powerful neighbors along the East Coast, it also provides an identity upon which to hang a defiant hat even larger than the oneresting on the bronze head of William Penn atop City Hall. From the outside, this is nonsense, of course, considering it is a city that birthed the nation’sfirst library,stock exchange,hospital, andmedical school, and hosted, inthe small Assembly Room at the Pennsylvania State House, the very creation of the country. That event was so momentous, the building’s name was changed to Independence Hall. Since Philadelphia lost its standing as the largest city in the United States to New York in 1790, the same year that Congress agreed tomove the nation’s capital to a fetid bit of swampland on the Maryland-Virginia border, the chip on Philadelphia’s shoulder has grown, at least metaphorically, into an oak, and a simplistic narrative can substitute for the actual complexity of the place. So, in a city of phenomenal culinary variety and quality, the cheesesteak, often dreadfully prepared, isthe standard suggestion for visitors. And on and on. Slang is favored over well-schooled speech, and there is even a homegrown word —jawn— that manages to mean everything and nothing at the same time. This, in a city that has more college and university students than Boston, the supposed Athens of America. Mentioning that, however, destroys the illusion, and illusion has served Philadelphia well, including its sports fans. As noted football expert Bob Dylan said,when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose. Would that it were true for Eagles fans as they hunker down Sunday evening for this next milepost game that has come up so quickly along the highway. The Eagles were barely a winning team last season and are five years removed from their stunning last championship. To have this new chance arrive, and so quickly on the heels of a surprisingPhillies run to the World Series, is a giddy treat, but also strange because now the team issupposedto win. “Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed,” Alexander Pope, the poet, wrote. Pope,left hunchbacked and shrunken by tuberculosis of the spine before he was a teenager, knew what he was talking about. Eagles fans, if they study team history before Sunday evening’s game against the Kansas City Chiefs and former coach Andy Reid, should do their best to keep expectations in check as well. This is only the fourth appearance by the Eagles during the NFL’s Super Bowl era, which began with the 1966 season. They were also favored in their first go, a three-point choice against the Oakland Raiders in the first week of the Reagan administration. Some saythe eventual 27-10 losswas caused by an overly harsh week of practice directed by coach Dick Vermeil — “Nobody ever drowned in sweat,” Vermeil was fond of saying — but the game frayed for a much simpler reason. Quarterback Ron Jaworski threw three interceptions to the sameslew-footed linebackerand fumbled away yet another possession. It is a testament to Jaworski’s pleasant nature, or perhaps to Philadelphia’s comfortable relationship with disappointment, that he remains a cherished local personality to this day, despite perhaps the worst big-game performance in the city’s sports history. If Philadelphia’s civic personality is truly that of an underdog valiantly fighting the odds against it, that was cemented, at least for Eagles fans, by the team’s most recent Super Bowl appearance. You knowhow that turned out. It is every local’s fondest wish that the exalted really will be humbled, and the humble exalted, particularly since the preferred casting in this city is the latter. Doesn’t often happen that way, though. Favorites earn their status, and the Eagles have done that throughout the season. Fans will have to live withsupporting Apollo Creed this time aroundand hope the story comes out a little differently. Bob Ford was a staff writer and columnist for The Inquirer from 1987 to 2020."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_26,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Imagine an environmentally sound planet populated with joyful, healthy animals, humans included. Picture a global society in which everyone is respected and treated as an individual, a world where anger, fear and violence give way to kindness, security and peace.November is World Vegan Month, a celebration of our compassionate ambition to save the world — and if we want to be around to do that, then going vegan is the first step, because the destructive industry that’s killing animals and the planet is killing us, too, physically, emotionally and spiritually.The flesh of dead animals is often contaminated with feces and blood, and meat is the leading cause of food poisoning in the U.S. According to a study at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 96% of Tyson chicken packages were contaminated with campylobacter, a dangerous bacterium that causes diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain and fever. Think of your best days, your favorite memories. Did they include diarrhea? Research shows that vegan eating can prolong life expectancy by more than 10 years. And vegans enjoy more energy and better health than meat-eaters. The meat industry, on the other hand, is all about suffering, death and destruction.Animals used for food are confined by the thousands to dark, filthy sheds, cramped wire cages or tight metal crates without even enough space to turn around. As babies, they’re torn away from their loving mothers, and they endure horrific, premature deaths in slaughterhouses. There’s a reason nobody does yoga to the sound of blood-curdling screams. Animals slaughtered for food experience fear and pain, not peace and well-being. We are what we eat, and those who eat animals or anything taken from them are ingesting misery.Taking an ethical stance against harming others not only helps keep them safe but also strengthens our own inner peace. What we have in our hearts profoundly influences everyone around us, including animals. Just think of the rotting, broken human souls who relish the carnage of dogfighting and compelling vulnerable canines to maim and kill each other. Then think of the overwhelming love and compassion radiating from someone who rescues a dog from such bloodshed and the joy they bring to others.There are no smiles in a slaughterhouse — but it’s nothing but smiles when cats have the run of the house. Fulfillment arises from how we treat each other. When sentient beings are suffering, we should help them — not experiment on, eat, wear or exploit them in any other way.Humans, cows, pigs, birds, lizards — we’re all Earthlings living on the same planet in crisis. Exploiting animals for their flesh, milk, skin or anything else generates enormous amounts of pollution. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, factory farms produce about 500 million tons of manure each year, much of it stored in waste “lagoons,” and runoff from these operations is a leading cause of pollution in rivers and lakes — animal agriculture literally fills the planet with crap.Going vegan is the planet’s gym membership. Environmentalism relies on the synergy between concern for the biosphere and concern for our own health. When we feel good about ourselves, we’re more likely to care about others and take steps to mitigate the human-induced climate catastrophe.World Vegan Month is really “Save the World Month.” But let’s look past November. Let’s make December World Vegan Month. And then January. And then every month after that. Let’s make it World Vegan Forever. Learn vegan. Eat vegan. Dress vegan. Play vegan. Be vegan.

The word “vermin” describes harmful rodents and insects. When turned on human beings, it implies the same response — extermination. In response to criticism that Trump was calling for violence against his enemies, his campaign doubled down. Spokesman Steven Cheung told the Washington Post that “those who try to make that ridiculous assertion are clearly snowflakes grasping for anything because they are suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome and their entire existence will be crushed when President Trump returns to the White House.”Trump has taken over the party of Abraham Lincoln, who in the closing weeks of the Civil War called for “malice toward none” and “charity for all,” and who urged that Americans worked to bind up the nation’s wounds. Trump now leads the party of Dwight D. Eisenhower, who led U.S. soldiers in an epic struggle to throw out Nazis, fascists and others who branded people as “vermin” for opposing them.Years after World War II, after his two terms as president, and after the witch hunts in which Sen. Joseph McCarthy promised to root out communists in the Army and the federal government, Eisenhower spoke to his fellow Republicans at their 1964 convention.“I believe with all my heart that the kind of party ours must be is one that rejects as unfit and unwholesome all who are purveyors of hatred and intolerance, who are prone to the use of violence, who malign the character of fellow Americans and who baselessly charge decent Americans with treasonable acts or intentions,” he said.How can Americans, Republicans particularly, recognize Trump as the successor to their great leaders of the past? There is increasingly more of a resemblance to other leaders, of other countries, who, like him, hammered hatred, grievance and self-obsession into the opposite of liberty, justice and democracy. Those dictators were ultimately defeated only at the cost of hundreds of thousands of American lives.—Los Angeles TimesRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."
suffolknewsherald_2023_237,"Published 5:16 pm Friday, July 21, 2023ByStaff ReportsFolks, how are you doing this summer so far? Have you been roadtripping, traveling a lot? Hiking or camping? Or, having a staycation, while spending more time with family and friends? That’s all good. Stay safe always, though.Whatever you’re doing to relieve yourselves from the hot and humid, muggy and sweaty, simmering, sweltering and sizzling summer heat, be sure to stay hydrated. Drink plenty of liquid, like water or gatorade, after doing outdoor activities for a while.If you’re indoor, or staycation, though, would you like to spend some summertime reading, too? I’m sure you’ve got some planned fun activities this summer. But, wherever you are, don’t forget or neglect to exercise, not only your body but also your mind with interesting books or reading materials. There are plenty of these books in your city library. They’re on the shelves waiting for you. Besides, books are one of your best friends, aren’t they?Mind you, every summer, I always think of children and how they spend their summer productively. So I’m always reminded of this quote by an English poet, playwright, essayist and politician, Joseph Addison (1672-1719 : “Reading is to the mind, what exercise is to the body. As by the one, health is preserved, strengthened and invigorated: by the other, virtue (which is the health of the mind is kept alive, cherished, and confirmed.”Just as we able people, young and old, need exercise physically, we need to also exercise our brain so our mind will remain healthy and well. This includes our spiritual and social life, too. Praying and engaging in human contact or connection are important for our wellness and wellbeing.Reading is a wholesome, mental activity that can make your summer more interesting and memorable, challenging and, quite frankly, stimulating to the brain.Reading helps sharpen your mind and makes you more knowledgeable about issues, things, people and events.When reading a travelog or an article about this or that place, you can indulge yourself imagining and wondering, appreciating and feeling like you’re in that place. If, for example, you’re reading a biography, you come to know how and why or when that person lived and what contributions he or she made.You have a choice to read. Go for fiction or nonfiction, a poem or a short story, a novel, a newspaper or magazine article that can be inspiring, informative and educational. Better yet to read anything that helps your mind to think and understand.If you’re a parent to young ones, you’re doing a great service if and when you read to your children regularly. When they see you reading, they also will be curiously inspired to browse or open a book and read. Or, they will ask or bug or bother you to read to/for them, I bet.I remember reading an article on reading with children by Michael Kelly of Albany Times Union years ago. He offered the following ways or tips to get your children to read for fun:Alright, folks, go to the library this time. If you have young child/ren, or grandkids, bring or take them with you. Ask or check with the librarian or her assistants for help and information. There’s a summer reading program or activity going on there, I’m sure. Browse in the shelves books that you can borrow, if or when you have already a city library card. For young ones, the beginners especially, you can borrow picture books for them.Then, start reading to them loud enough so they can hear you pronouncing, enunciating or reading the words or phrases correctly.See what reading or the power of reading can do? It can change us and our whole perspective of life and things around us. It can motivate us to do positive things for others. It can illuminate and enlighten our narrow viewpoint of life and, therefore, open our eyes to new horizons, new possibilities to improve our life-world. It can help transform us and our world. It will ultimately transform us into a well-informed and concerned citizens who have the power to change our life-world for the better.Happy reading, while enjoying summertime!Chris A.

I would like to offer my own preliminary experiences with it.Undoubtedly, we must accept the technology as it exists and evolves, evaluating its advantages and disadvantages critically. Indeed, there are many areas where AI can be a great service by facilitating numerous tasks we cannot do well or easily.But for students, there are major risks involved. Allowing a computer to write an assignment represents, well, plagiarism to the extreme.It hurts the students not only because they will probably be caught and penalized, but they did not do their own task, did not accept the challenge of writing a critical piece, and hence did not learn the basics of how to formulate their own thoughts and to express them in a logical and convincing fashion.AI cannot develop an innovative thesis, cannot come up with new ideas. AI is super good at summarizing various ideas or texts, comparing and contrasting them.However, our students must learn how to find their own voice, develop their own ideas, and hence learn how to grow into independent adults. AI takes all that away and infantilizes the young generation.As a teacher, I was able to detect the use of AI immediately without any external help (i.e., Turnitin because the narrative was basically irrelevant, removed from the topic, and did not say anything meaningful.The danger with AI can only increase in the near future, but the European Union at least has already formulated strict rules and regulations. The U.S. is, once again, lagging behind for miles and accepts everything in a laissez-faire manner.But we the teachers are responsible for the intellectual growth of our students, and AI is at this point a toxic vehicle.Albrecht ClassenHiloKudos for a great family event in HiloWe want to acknowledge the hard work and incredible organization that went into (the Dec. 9 Keiki Fun Run at Waiakea High.Our three oldest grandkids participated, as well as about 800 kids from 20-plus elementary schools on this island.We saw lots of Waiakea High students teaching, coaching and helping out with keiki games.

suffolknewsherald_2023_98,"Published 5:38 pm Tuesday, March 14, 2023ByLetters to the EditorEditor:A regional real estate association distributed a letter to its members asking them to attend the March 21 Planning Commission meeting to support the approval of a rezoning request on the agenda. The letter asserted that rezoning is necessary to maintain housing inventory, while there are already 7,480 units approved and not yet built.According to the realtor, a limited inventory will drive up the cost of homes, making it unaffordable for young and average families, although there are many factors making home buying unaffordable, such as inflation and interest rate increases, which reduce the purchasing power of an average family, which is not eliminated with additional rezoning.The realtor asserted that to build schools, roads and other infrastructure, we need growth to collect additional taxes, although we know that growth requires additional city services, and the city is struggling to maintain an adequate level of service, even without additional development already in the pipeline. The realtor references “Smart Growth” to support additional rezoning, although “Smart Growth” approaches include conserving resources by reinvesting in existing infrastructure and involving residents in development decisions, stressing the importance of balancing health, schools, taxes, traffic, the environment, economic growth and fairness in development decisions. The realtor calls out CARE4Suffolk for opposing rezoning, although the CARE4Suffolk mission supports responsible growth, where the citizens of Suffolk will receive the level of service expected to maintain our quality of life.Some realtors value having additional homes to produce sales as a higher priority than having safe roads and adequate school capacity.The city must consider the needs of all citizens and not merely some developers and realtors who stand to profit from irresponsible development under the guise of “Smart Growth.” The city must take a pause on rezoning until there is a reduction in the pipeline and the city’s infrastructure can provide adequate levels of services as laid out in the UDO and the Comprehensive Plan.

suffolknewsherald_2023_149,"Published 6:40 pm Friday, January 20, 2023BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardGov. Glenn Youngkin’s announcement Friday that Amazon Web Services will invest $35 billion to build multiple “data centers” in Virginia by 2040 got our minds racing with possibilities.Suffolk, which is now home to one of the e-commerce behemoth’s largest distribution centers, should pursue one of the new data centers with vigor.Aside from the economic impact of new jobs and much-needed tax revenue for city government, landing one of the Amazon facilities will demonstrate to Suffolk citizens that elected and appointed leadership has a vision beyond warehouses.Such vision has been lacking amid a flurry of announcements of distribution centers coming to town and adding more truck traffic to Suffolk’s clogged road infrastructure. The City Council’s blessing last year of a massive warehousing campus in the core of the city off U.S. Routes 460 and 58 left Suffolkians in a collective funk about the coming upheaval of their quality of life.To be clear, data centers alone aren’t the answer economically. Like warehouses, they don’t employ huge numbers of people and they aren’t the most pleasant structures aesthetically. But they are light burdens on infrastructure, especially roads.Youngkin said that “numerous localities” in the commonwealth are under consideration by Amazon, which will create a combined 1,000 new jobs. We’re crossing our fingers — and toes too — that Suffolk is one.Communities under consideration “offer robust utility infrastructure, lower costs, great livability and highly educated workforces and will benefit from the associated economic development and increased tax base, assisting the schools and providing services to the community,” Youngkin said.Our city certainly fits the bill.Landing an Amazon data center could also help leverage critical funding for highway improvements to accommodate the coming surge in truck traffic.Pending approval by the General Assembly, the Mega Data Center Incentive Program would make Amazon eligible to receive a grant of up to $140 million for site and infrastructure improvements, workforce development and other project-related costs where it builds data centers.Let’s make it happen, Suffolk.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

As the story unfolded, we realized that the pollen was so bad there that it had formed a thick scum on the water, much like what you may have noticed in Suffolk’s ponds and lakes recently.The alligator had come through the yellow scum to sun himself on the bank and lay there long enough to be dusted by the massive amounts of pollen in the air until he was totally coated in yellow from snarly snout to scaly tail. Not being a fan of alligators, especially the ones hanging out in our grandchildren’s yard, it was nice to know that at least they were easier to spot.On our return trip home, we started talking about the yellow alligator and alligators in general. Alligators are native as far north as North Carolina. The Alligator River is not too far across the border into North Carolina from Virginia. There is a resident population as far north as Merchant’s Mill Pond State Park in North Carolina; it’s a beautiful place to visit.Alligators are not native to Virginia, not even in the Great Dismal Swamp. We think we’ll ride down to North Carolina just to check and see if they have any yellow ones.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_171,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The USC campus (Gary Coronado/Los Angeles Times/TNS Socrates would weep. The great philosopher of ancient Athens was among the first teachers of critical thinking, you might say, and he died for doing so. And now, college philosophy departments — along with the other humanities and the social sciences— are shrinking, with reduced fields of study, smaller teaching staffs and fewer courses.Part of this shrinkage in many big universities and smaller colleges as well is the result of rising concerns about the cost of a college degree.Students understandably want to feel that their investment of time and money will pay off in the not-too-far future. A STEM degree — science, tech, engineering and math — often opens up more and better-paid career opportunities than those in other majors. As a result, fewer students are signing up for non-STEM majors and courses, and colleges are in turn shrinking those departments.University humanities and social sciences departments also have been demonized by the far right as hotbeds of “wokeism,” fuzzy thinking and rampant liberalism, where some conservative students and professors say they’re made to feel unwelcome when they are not taking a progressive stance.In North Carolina, the Legislature passed a budget this year that provides funding for new distinguished professorships only in STEM fields at the state’s public universities.Apparently, the legislators also don’t care whether the state produces top-notch urban planners, crime solvers, social workers, psychologists and language translators, all of which fall within social sciences.There’s nothing wrong with supporting STEM majors, which provide a path to well-paid, meaningful and fulfilling jobs. But universities were never meant to be merely career-prep schools. They also teach — or should teach — students how to think deeply and critically, analyze smartly, bring people together collaboratively, communicate articulately, as well as innovate and create. All of these traits are at the heart of humanities and social science studies.If a good future awaits people with these abilities, why are the non-STEM fields often viewed as career dead ends? This is where colleges have let their students down. Employers are looking for demonstrated capacity, which means they want applicants who have shown these abilities outside the classroom, in some mix of experience with campus organizations, volunteer gigs, internships and paid work. Relatively few colleges do a good job of providing students with those opportunities or guidance in how their studies might translate into rewarding careers.Colleges that want the liberal arts to continue as robust fields of study need to reconsider the status quo. They should slim down tuition costs and ensure that students graduate with strong skills in critical and innovative thinking and in working with others.At the same time, right-wing politicians (and left-wing, for that matter should be keeping their fingers out of how universities run their academic programs. They aren’t experts, and their attempts to control colleges arise from personal biases and political interests rather than from sound academic thinking. It seldom comes to good.Socrates was convicted of impiety and corrupting the youths of Athens, and sentenced to drink poison hemlock. Daring ideas taught by great thinkers have long felt like a threat to petty minds.— Los Angeles TimesRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.A 22-year-old Hilo man accused of a series of violent assaults on his 23-year-old girlfriend has been released from custody by a judge without posting cash bail."

I endorsed her then and she has more than earned my endorsement to be the Republican nominee in the 17thSenatorial District.Emily has served us well and worked very hard to ensure that we are well represented as she completes her sixth year of proven service to our 64thdistrict in the state house. Six years of proven and successful service to the citizens. I don’t know of anyone else running for the nomination that has that kind of proven record. It is very easy to appear at big gatherings of supporters; flash a big smile, use a well used list of “things I’m going to do,” and then go on about what a great job you are going to do. It is entirely another thing to have a proven record of service that includes considerable accomplishments; often in a politically difficult environment with the other party in the majority.How hard is it to choose between someone with a proven record; with a reputation of simply outworking her opponents and other candidates that seem to be all hat and no cattle?

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_167,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°(Dreamstime/TNS “How many kids do you have?”Even five years later, that seemingly simple question stirs a panic inside me and brings tears to my eyes.On Jan. 18, 2019, my world changed forever when my 17-year-old son died by suicide. His death was a shock but not a complete surprise since he had been struggling with depression for so long despite treatment.As a pediatrician, I had experienced death in childhood more times than I care to think about. I had been in homes with families as their children died after a prolonged illness, in hospitals when children had been brought in following car crashes, SIDS, or drownings. I had even been with parents whose children had died at the hands of a child abuser. But nothing prepared me for the death of my own child.This year alone about 43,000 children will die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The experience of losing a child is not rare, and yet many pediatricians are not fully prepared to help parents manage the long haul of grief that accompanies the loss.The American Academy of Pediatrics recognized the need for more guidance for pediatricians and outlined more concrete ways we can support parents and siblings of children who have died. In a new clinical report, “Supporting Families After the Death of a Child or Adolescent,” the AAP recognizes that grief is complex and long lasting for parents of child loss.Giving pediatricians resources for families is a start, but this report also encourages pediatricians and others in the medical field to talk about the lost child, and the effect of the loss on the parent and siblings. Encouraging all feelings — anger, sadness, guilt and relief among others — is essential to creating a safe space for parents to grieve.This holds true beyond the clinic walls, too. As we all encounter more friends, colleagues and families who have lost children, we all can offer support to families who are grieving these losses. My No. 1 advice, as both a parent and a pediatrician, is to talk about the lost child.It is tempting to think that by not mentioning the child we spare the parent pain. Actually, the opposite is true. Most parents who have lost children are thinking about their child every day. When you ask a grieving parent about their child or about how they are doing, you allow them the freedom to share a moment of normalcy with you.You do not have to say anything more than, How are you remembering your child this holiday season? What has made this holiday season easier or harder since your child died? And then sit back and listen. If you knew the child, share a memory. If not lend an ear.Grief will accompany me every day of my life because I grieve not only the loss of my son but the loss of our shared future, the loss of what his future might have been, and the loss of my future as a mother of a grown man. With the support of friends and my pediatrician, my grief remains. But I keep growing, loving and finding new joy, so my grief doesn’t feel so big every day.Molly O’Shea, MD, FAAP, is a pediatrician in Michigan.DENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler."
hawaiitribune_herald_2023_188,"Thoughts and ideasabout homelessnessThoughts and ideasabout homelessnessIt’s been apparent that homelessness has been a big problem in Hawaii for a while now. Homeless rates in Hawaii are double that of any other state in America — about 18 in 10,000 people that live here are homeless.The tropical climate here is the ideal living conditions for a homeless person because they don’t have to face the harsh elements of the changing seasons that they would have on the mainland, making this a “hobo’s paradise.”However, this isn’t the only reason why there are so many homeless people here.Hawaii is an extremely expensive place to call home due to the lack of available housing. The prices of houses and rent go up because of supply and demand, causing many people to struggle every day to live here, which turns people with homes into homeless people.By making more available housing, the cost of living here will be more affordable for the less fortunate and will help lower the rates of homelessness. Also, by making emergency housing and rehabilitation centers for substance-abusers available to the homeless can help lead them in the right direction and get them back on their feet.While homelessness seems like an impossible problem to fix, there are things that can be done to help counter the problem. The expenses of living here make it very easy for a working person to struggle to stay on their feet. By making more available housing, the burdens will lighten and help prevent people from becoming homeless.The emergency housing and rehabilitation centers can help many already homeless people become contributing members of society.Brendan InabaHilo‘Making excuses fortheir inhumanity’War is state sanctioned murder and is inhumane by definition. This comes when both sides are willing to deny the humanity of the other.Both Israel and the Arabs are guilty here. Explain to me how 2,000-pound bombs can be used in a surgical strike.What did Hamas think would happen when they acted like World War II Nazis?This war won’t solve anything. Israel will never be able to silence and end Hamas with force alone. Nearly 60 years after the Six-Day War, they’re still at it.This is just killing that leads to more killing. How can you keep doing the same thing and expect a different result?Both sides cry about their suffering, yet inflict it on others without shame.Both are equally guilty. Supporting either side is just making excuses for their inhumanity.Russ ButtonPahoa"
suffolknewsherald_2023_108,"Published 5:28 pm Tuesday, February 28, 2023ByStaff ReportsChristians all around the world have the opportunity to grow in their faith with the observance of the Lenten season, which started with Ash Wednesday, Feb.22.Ash Wednesday reminds us mortals and believers of Jesus Christ, our lord and savior, of the reality that we came from dust and to dust we shall return.It is a church tradition and observance filled with symbolisms to signify that we live and that we die.It is more than a ritual of receiving ashes on our forehead from our pastor or designated church minister to remind us of our existence and our mortality here on earth. It offers us spiritual growth and development in our faith of the one who created everything in the universe, the almighty God through his only begotten son, Jesus Christ who became the sacrificial lamb for our sake.We solemnly observe Lent to remember and commemorate the passion, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.“Lent is a new beginning, a path leading to the certain goal of Easter, Christ’s victory over death,” said Pope Francis, the supreme pontiff and leader of the Catholic Church.Lent offers us Christians conversion, the opportunity to change our hearts, to return to God, and to grow in faith and friendship with Jesus Christ. The 40-day season is marked with the personal practice of fasting, praying and almsgiving.With our faith and belief in almighty God, who made heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, and the Holy Spirit, we Christians and sinners are blessed to have the ability and capability to have a change of heart, to deepen our spirituality or nurture our spiritual life much as we desire to grow our physical and social life to the fullest.Prayer is one simple activity that can help us get closer to God and can help grow our faith and friendship with Christ during Lent.In our Lenten journey, we, as a Christian faith community, are encouraged to do three things to carry out our commitment as believers and followers of Christ: fast, pray and give alms.Like prayer, fasting is a personal, private matter. It takes personal discipline to fast, to sacrifice, to refrain or abstain from eating or indulging in worldly things that takes away our focus on what matters and what is important — our relationship with God through his only begotten son, Jesus Christ.Almsgiving is another Lenten practice we’re asked to do as followers of Christ. Sharing what we have to alleviate the condition of our underserved, underprivileged and marginalized members of our society is something that we can do as members of our faith community.Donating a portion of our income, a weekly offering, to our church is something we can do to help in the spiritual growth and development of our faith community.Giving something of ourselves, our time, treasure and talents, is a manifestation of our being generous and kind to our brothers and sisters in Christ. It is also an indication of our desire to help grow and build our church.Since Lent offers us the opportunity to contemplate the temptations our Lord Jesus Christ faced during his solitude in the desert, we are given the opportunity to renew our commitment to be more like Jesus, to do God’s will and to put God above worldly concerns.As we continue with our Lenten journey and pilgrimage, let us be aware of our desire to repent, ask forgiveness and atone for our sins so that our conversion becomes faith-full and meaningful.Growing in faith during Lent is and should be our goal as Christians. We have to experience how Jesus Christ sacrificed and suffered for us, in order to have a meaningful Lenten season.Prayer, fasting and almsgiving are Christian practices that help strengthen our faith and also help make our relationship with Jesus Christ closer than ever.May our Lenten season be filled with peace, love and hope, and charity as we continue to grow spiritually in faith with God through Jesus Christ, our lord and savior.

hawaiitribune_herald_2023_130,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°This is a good week to remember that in the hours after Senate Republicans refused to convict Donald Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, offered a hint of future comeuppance for the former president. Trump, he said, was still liable for everything he did as president.“He didn’t get away with anything yet — yet,” McConnell said on the Senate floor on Feb. 13, 2021. “We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one.”Almost three years later, we are approaching the moment of truth. Trump, under federal indictment for his role in the insurrection, is attempting to evade legal accountability as he always has, by delay and misdirection.On Monday night, the case reached the Supreme Court, where litigation is normally measured in months, if not years. That’s understandable, especially when legal issues are complex or involve matters of great public significance. The course of justice is slow and steady, as the tortoise sculptures scattered around the court’s building at 1 First St. symbolize.But sometimes time is of the essence. That’s the case now, as the court weighs whether to expedite the case against Trump, who is trying to get his criminal charges thrown out a few weeks before the Republican primaries begin and less than a year before the 2024 election.Last week after the federal trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, rejected Trump’s legal arguments that he is immune from prosecution, he appealed to the federal appeals court in Washington, a process that he clearly hoped would add weeks of delay. Special counsel Jack Smith countered by going directly to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to take the case away from the appeals court and rule quickly.It was, he acknowledged, “an extraordinary request” for “an extraordinary case.” The justices took the hint, ordering Trump to file his response by next week — lightning speed compared with the court’s usual pace.The prosecution was further complicated on Wednesday, when the justices agreed to hear a case challenging the government’s reliance on a particular obstruction charge against hundreds of Jan. 6 attackers and against Trump himself.Prosecuting a presidential candidate during a campaign is not an ideal situation. Still, the justices were right not to sit on Smith’s appeal. The American people deserve to know, well before they head to the polls, whether one of the two probable major-party candidates for president is a convicted criminal — whether he is guilty, no less, of conspiring to subvert the outcome of a free and fair election to keep himself in power. The Jan. 6 trial, one of four Trump is expected to face over the coming months and arguably the most consequential, is scheduled to start in early March, and it cannot move forward until the court decides whether he, as a former president, is immune from prosecution for his actions in office.The good news is there’s nothing stopping them. The justices are fully capable of acting fast when the circumstances demand. Consider the 2000 presidential election: The dispute over Florida’s vote count rocketed up to the court not once but twice in a matter of days in early December. The court issued its final opinion in Bush v. Gore, which was 61 pages in all, including dissents, barely 24 hours after hearing oral arguments.In 1974 the court managed to decide another hugely consequential case involving the presidency — Richard Nixon’s refusal to turn over his secret Oval Office tapes — over the course of a few weeks in June and July. The court’s ruling, which came out during its summer recess, went against Nixon and led to his resignation shortly afterward.The stakes in both cases were extraordinary, effectively deciding who would (or would not be president. In both cases, the justices knew the country was waiting on them, and they showed they had no trouble resolving a legal dispute rapidly. The Jan. 6 charges against Trump are similarly consequential. Never before in American history had a sitting president interfered with the peaceful transfer of power. No matter their positions on Trump and his eligibility to run again, all Americans have a compelling interest in getting a verdict in this case before the election.For that to happen, the Supreme Court needs to rule on Trump’s claim of executive immunity, one of a narrow category of appeals that can stop a trial in its tracks rather than having to wait until after conviction to be filed. The former president’s argument is that his actions to overturn the election were taken in the course of his official duties and thus that he is absolutely immune from prosecution for them. It’s an absurd claim, as Chutkan explained in denying it on Dec. 1.“Whatever immunities a sitting president may enjoy, the United States has only one chief executive at a time, and that position does not confer a lifelong ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ pass,” she wrote. “Defendant’s four-year service as commander in chief did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens.”Trump made two additional arguments, involving double jeopardy and the First Amendment, that were even weaker than the immunity claim, and Chutkan denied those as well. She was probably tempted to toss out all of them as frivolous, as so many of Trump’s delaying tactics, dressed up as legal arguments, turn out to be. Instead she erred on the side of caution because no one has ever made such arguments, so there is no legal precedent for assessing their validity.Of course, the reason no one had made these arguments is that no former president had been criminally charged. This is classic Donald Trump, freeloading on everyone else’s respect for the law. You can drive 100 mph down the highway only if you are confident the other cars will stay in their lanes.The irony is that even as he seeks to delay and obstruct the justice system, Trump is bolstering the case for a speedy trial, thanks to his repeated threatening outbursts on social media. He has attacked the judge, the prosecutor and others, including those who are likely to testify against him. Statements like those endanger the safety of witnesses and the basic fairness of the trial and have resulted in a gag order against the former president, but they are routine for a man who has spent a lifetime acting out and daring decent Americans everywhere to do something, anything, to stop him.“He keeps challenging the system to hold him accountable,” Kristy Parker of Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan advocacy group, told me. Most other defendants who behaved in this way would risk being thrown in jail for violating the conditions of their bail, she said, but “no one wants to see him locked up prior to trial. It’s not going to be good for American society.”She was referring to the propensity for threats and violence that Trump’s supporters, egged on by their overlord, have shown in the face of any attempt to hold him to account. At this point, however, many Americans have accepted that risk as part of the price of cleansing the nation of a uniquely malicious political figure. We know the violence is coming, just as we know Trump will claim that any election he doesn’t win is rigged against him.“The best way to do anything about this is to have the trial soon,” Parker said. Right now, there are nine people in America who can help guarantee that is what happens.© 2023 The New York Times Company"
