state_press_2022_51,"Lots of students are sick of talking about politics. However, there are several propositions that will be on the ballot if you choose to vote. Election Day is Tuesday, and unlike all of these other so-called reporters, I m not here to shove propaganda down your throat. Personally, I am sick of talking politics. Kari Lake this, voting rights that, blah, blah, blah. I m kind of the bravest thing you can be politically nowadays — truly apolitical. It s hard being the last true moderate out here. I just don t like to get involved with that sort of stuff. It s messy. I m tired of finding out all of my closest friends are horrible bigots. So, I m not going to ask anymore. I d rather find out the old fashioned way — through a slur said at a cookout. On Oct. 29, a federal judgerefusedto bar groups from intimidating people outside the voting booth. The following Tuesday, that same judge issued a restraining order against ballot watchers. Now they can t even hold terrifying weapons outside of the polls. In my opinion, that sort of takes the fun out of it. So, this election season, I ve decided I won t be voting. Everywhere I go I m bombarded by proposition numbers and political ads, and I just can t keep track of this mumbo-jumbo anymore. It s not like any of it is important anyway. I can t even walk outside my dorm without running into canvassers going on about preserving democracy, like they re doing me some big favor. I already have enough numbers to keep track of. I reach adulthood, and all of a sudden I have to remember something called a social security number. Now they re telling me I have to vote for more numbers? TakeProposition 309. This jumble of numbers would require dates of birth and voter identification for mail-in ballots and eliminate the two-document alternative to photo IDs for in-person voting. The last time I checked, none of this affected me. In fact, all of these propositions seem to target people who aren t me. It makes me feel left out. I m just so tired of hearing about the millions of inequalities faced by people who aren t me — it s such a burden. OrProposition 129, which would require all citizen-created ballot initiatives to be single-subject. Opponents are saying this is a sweeping attempt by Republicans to get tighter control over legislation. But I think it s a harmless effort to dilute voter power. What do I care if the fundamental way citizens protect their rights against legislators is changed on a whim? I, for one, trust our legislators. It s not like they could make any laws that would negatively affect me. Proposition 308, if passed, would give undocumented students in Arizona the opportunity to achieve higher education. It s a reversal of Proposition 300, which was passed in 2006. The proposal won t take anything away from U.S. citizens, won t increase taxes, and aids in long run economic growth by contributing to the workforce. But I m going to vote no, because it doesn t apply to me. The most egregious example of a so-called proposition isProposition 211, which would give voters more information about the companies supporting candidates. I actually want politicians to be able to donate large sums of money in secret. I think it keeps things interesting. If I knew the largest contributing companies to the budding fascists in our political system, this whole politics thing would be way too easy. I don t understand why these canvassers target me to begin with. I can t change our political landscape. As a white, middle-class, documented owner of a trust fund, I just don t feel like my vote matters anymore. Now, former President Barack Obama says democracy may not survive if election deniers like Kari Lake or Mark Finchem win. Well, democracy will just have to die without me. Not getting involved in local politics is the best decision I ve ever made. I mean, none of this matters. In fact, it matters so little that it took you only four paragraphs to learn about the most pressing issues on the ballot. So, this Tuesday, vote. And vote wisely. Or we have to continue to live in a world where this isn t really satire. Edited by Sadie Buggle, Piper Hansen, Sophia Balasubramanian, Greta Forslund and Grace Copperthite.

crimson_2022_124,"Dear You, Sorry, I don’t really know your name. Yes, I am talking to you. You, the reader. Or more importantly you, the commenter. You are finally getting the platform that it seems that you want. This article is all about you! I haven’t been a member of the Crimson for very long, nor have I been reading Crimson articles that long either, but yet, somehow you have made an imprint in my mind. I first got introduced to you last semester. As I was comping for the Crimson Editorial Board, I had a friend who was comping for the News Board– they met you much earlier than I did. I was a little bit in shock when I read her comments, as she was just reporting the news — simply objective. But still, her name, her peers names, were called out by you. We talked about you – about how you were intimidating and how we were afraid to poke the bear. So, I became a little nervous about what would happen when I started writing about subjective things, things that pertained to my identity and personality. Writing on this board must come with some vulnerability. Every time one writes, they leave a piece of themselves out there. I began to take my opinions more seriously and think critically about what I wanted to put online. The second time I met you was when I was first published. Despite my hesitancy and fear, I still decided that I would remain strong and still confront you. I was so proud of what I created; what I put time, effort, and passion into. I smiled as my parents linked my article on their Facebook and as my friends reposted it on Instagram. However, the next morning, when I read all the things you had to say, is when I started becoming progressively less and less excited about publishing. After that morning, I became more and more obsessed with you. My article did not even have that many comments, but I kept re-reading them to see what I could interpret from what you had said. I have always kept up with reading the Crimson, but now, reading your comments became added to my routine. It came to the point where I could recognize some of your screen names, due to how much time you spend reading and commenting on these articles. And I could always find you under the articles discussing race and gender. There was an article written back in 2018, titled “Who Can Be Racist?” which was the crux of it all. 317 comments of critiques, insults, and much more. I wondered what it felt like for the writer to see all of you guys. I struggle to decide if you matter or not, to put it bluntly. For all I know, you could be a 40-year-old man cooped up in his room, bored and full of hatred for a young college kid. Or maybe you’re some student at Yale, living out our rivalry to its full extent. This is how my friends and family would describe you at least — as they attempted to convince me to disregard the things that you say. But, I can’t just ignore you. You are the heart of what opinion journalism is — having the freedom and the platform to speak your mind. I will always be an avid supporter of spreading knowledge and having equal access for all voices to be heard. So who am I to stop you from doing exactly what I love? In the spirit of exercising their freedom of speech, I have seen some online vigilantes attempting to fight back against the rude and demeaning comments that you write on the Crimson website. But yet, you remain the same — consistently commenting on each post with your criticisms. So, what is left to do is just live with you. We writers just have to understand that you re a part of the package. I get to say my piece, you get yours. Oddly enough, this is an appreciation letter. I appreciate those of you who actually provide constructive criticism, but I also appreciate those of you who make my backbone stronger – whipping me into shape. I appreciate how you remind me of the privilege that I get to speak my mind on this platform as I choose. So, get comfortable, because it seems like we are both here for the long run. Love, Angie Gabeau Angie Gabeau ’25, a Crimson Editorial Editor, lives in Pennypacker."
ubyssey_2022_39,"Feb. 2, 2022 Written bySam Klein-Laufer Dear Dr. Jan Hare, Dr. Marianne MacTavish and the rest of the UBC Teacher Education Office, I am a student in the secondary cohort of the Bachelor of Education program. I understand that there is tremendous pressure placed by the various regulatory branches, UBC bureaucracy and the public health infrastructure of British Columbia to resume in-person learning as of February 7th. On behalf of some of my colleagues and peers, I would like to express that this move is incorrect and will negatively impact students. It also goes against the values of empathy and compassion as communicated to us in the teacher education program. For us in the BEd program, the term ends on Friday, February 18. This effectively means that we will have fewer than 10 days of in-person instruction before we go on our practicum. In that time we will attend lectures with 200 of our fellow students, who have commuted to campus from a variety of locations, which creates an extremely high risk of exposure. There isno vaccine requirementto attend classes at UBC. There is almost no testing on campus and exceptionally limited testing available to the general public. There is no way to know if we are positive beyond symptoms, meaning that we may spread COVID-19 to our friends and colleagues as well as UBC staff and faculty. This means that we will possibly have COVID prior to our practicum, and statistically speaking, some of us will have long COVID. This will impact our ability to complete our practicum to our full potential. Getting sick will also impact our ability to prepare and learn. This will add an extra stressor to an already insanely stressful time for education students. While we are compelled to complete our practicum — with all the associated risks — to receive a comprehensive education and be best prepared for our future students, the faculty of education has a choice now to keep us safer for an extra week. Beyond this, many of us live with our parents, our children and other clinically vulnerable individuals. Many of us have resigned to being exposed and contracting the virus while on our practicum given the dearth of safety protocols in the public school system to answer the new demands of the omicron variant. Based on UBC’s behaviour and the communication from our professors, there is also a lack of adequate safety procedures in place on campus as well. Many students also suffer from health issues that could be made worse, or could make them sicker than their other peers. These students will face added issues with the return to campus. We as teachers must exercise empathy and compassion. The teacher education curriculum asserts that these are necessary qualities of good teachers, yet we are not seeing these same values being exemplified by the Teacher Education Office with regard to in-person learning during the pandemic. Please do not put us at risk. Please do not put our parents, partners, children and other loved ones at risk. By Allowing us to remain online for the remaining 11 days of our semester you can imbue an extra sense of safety and help reduce student stress and improve student outcomes.

wildcat_arizona_2022_6,"Feb. 24 and 25 this year will find students across Tucson released from school for rodeo break, a holiday that presumably allows for Tucson citizens to attend the local rodeo. Rodeo break always contributed to making February my favorite month of the year, being that it was riddled with holidays and events that made sure there was no full week of school the entire month. Rodeo break, being exclusive to Tucson, also means that suddenly the entire city is taking over nearby destinations like Disneyland and San Diego. However, in all my years of going to public school in Tucson, I’ve never heard of any of my classmates attending the Tucson rodeo, called La Fiesta de los Vaqueros. So, why on Earth do we celebrate it? The answer is that the rodeo used to be a much bigger deal than it is today.Tucson Citizenreported that the longstanding tradition came about because the entire city used to shut down for the rodeo, and since every child in town was either in the parade or at it, the schools didn’t bother trying to stay open. La Fiesta de los Vaqueros’websiteattributes the rodeo’s creation back, in the 1920s, to the need for tourists in the midwinter desert season, as well as it being an excuse to celebrate the ranching history of Tucson and the surrounding area. Today, the rodeo is still an impressive event, though not as popular within town as it was back in the day. RELATED:COMIC: The College Cowboy #2 That brings us back to rodeo break at the schools. If the point of the recess was to allow students to attend the rodeo, what’s the point today? I believe that the holiday is still around to celebrate the history of Tucson and acknowledge its western roots in ranching. Year-round school systems, like the one used in the Vail School District, are tough and draining, and the midwinter season once the holidays have passed are even more so. I think that the kids deserve a break, and if it makes them think about the rodeo, then great. If it doesn’t, then at least it gives them a second to breathe in the middle of the hardest quarter of the school year. Montana State University’s D. Mark Anderson and Georgia State University’s Mary Beth Walkerarguedfor four-day school week, citing research that showed that students who had shorter weeks showed significant increases in performance compared to those on a traditional schedule. Though rodeo break is only one short break, shortened schedules like these combat the mania to keep kids in school, especially since the pandemic has sent parents into a craze of making their kids catch up to pre-online learning standards. The holiday may be bizarre, especially for some city schools where the only cowboys are the boys who wear big belt buckles but have never been anywhere near a real cow except for their middle school dairy farm field trip. But, it’s an opportunity for teachers to educate their students about the history of the city they’re growing up in, and it’s an opportunity for students to take that Thursday and Friday off and just camp out on the couch for a while.

crimson_2022_21,"How many more corpses do I have to transport to the morgue? Consider this hypothetical scenario: 1 a.m.: The operating room nurses take the bed out of the room, wheel it to the staff elevators, come up to our fifth-floor ICU, and park outside room 52. On the bed is a man no older than I, lying there, completely still. The patient is sedated and ventilated, with no less than eight different tubes maintaining bodily functions for him. 1:15 a.m.: I finish receiving report. A car accident on the highway threw this man into a windshield, where he hit his head and developed a subarachnoid hemorrhage, or bleeding in the brain. The surgeon evacuated any existing blood and placed a drain in the brain ventricle to prevent an increase in brain pressure. Prognosis: Dismal without a month of continued care. 1:45 a.m.: His parents call the hospital and ask about him. I field the call. Fighting through tears, his mother asks what has happened to her baby boy, if he’s going to be okay. The only thing I can tell her is that they can come to the hospital. 2:15 a.m.: The parents, no older than my own, arrive. His mother is a blubbering mess, makeup running, hair disheveled, barely understandable through the veil of grief. What breaks me is his father. A single arm around his wife and a blank stare. A single tear tracks down his vacant face. When that levee breaks… 2:30 a.m.: I spend two hours talking to his parents. I offer them treatment plans, support, assurance, and faith. In exchange, they gift me memories. Photos of their smiles, moments with him, his accomplishments, his dreams. I can’t reconcile these memories, these images with the person lying on the bed. 4:40 a.m.: The bill updates. One surgery: $90,000. One night of post-surgical critical care: $10,000. The doctor comes in and explains that, for care, another surgery may have to be done, requiring their son to stay in the hospital for at least another three weeks. The color drains from the mother’s face. A silent whisper betrays her: “We can’t afford that. We don’t have insurance.” She immediately claps her hand over her mouth. 7 a.m.: Time for day shift to come in. I pack up my belongings and swipe out. I will decide which road to take home. His parents will decide when to let their son die. 6:45 p.m.: I am back at the hospital. I am greeted with a purple monitor: comfort care. They cannot afford to treat their son, so they must let him pass. The impossible choice has been made. Without saying a word, I walk into the room, sit down on the couch, and hold their hands. I will be there as long as I need. 7:15 p.m.: He’s dead. While working as a care partner at my local hospital, I watched people with worse situations stand up and walk out with their family and multiple “get well soon” balloons in tow. They could pay; this man could not. While this exact story may be hypothetical, albeit inspired by one of my own experiences, similar stories of people dying due to a lack of health insurance are true for thousands of families around the United States every year. It is far past time to dispose of the payment obstacle. The impetus is on Harvard and other such powerful institutions to use their voices to do good, enact change, and save people’s lives. Many people who read this will agree with me wholeheartedly, but this story is not for them. This story is for those who fall prey to the maelstrom ofmisinformation, misconstruction, and misjudgment surrounding the system of single-payer healthcare under which all essential healthcare costs are covered by a single governmental source. This is for those like the Harvard administration, which automatically enrolls every student in the Blue Cross Blue Shield sponsored Health Insurance plan and discourages enrollment in the state-sponsored Massachusetts Health Connector — established for those who have recently lost health insurance. This is for those, like the Harvard administration, who continue and propagate the current inaccessible system of private healthcare that has contributed to the death of more than 162,000 people in seven years. There are many arguments I could make in support of single-payer healthcare. No, it’s not more expensive; some researchers have found it to save a net $2 trillion in a ten-year period. No, you won’t have to wait much longer for care. But all these arguments have been made by people more educated, powerful, and respected. To all those who dispute a single-payer health system on the grounds that it is uneconomical, or inefficient: Your arguments have been refuted time and time again, by scholars and experts more knowledgeable than us both. I can only say one additional thing to try to change your mind. I will have to put this man’s cold, stiff, bare dead body in a body bag and take him to the morgue. You will not. Anant P.

stanforddaily_2022_7,"“Move fast and break things.” Words uttered not by a burglar, but rather by Mark Zuckerberg. It is telling that Facebook’s since-abandoned motto is still frequently quoted by billionaire CEOs, college dropout founders, and widely touted as the driving motivation behind Silicon Valley. Perhaps this is indicative of a rising sentiment that technology can solve almost everything — often at a breakneck speed and by disrupting existing approaches. Stroll through Stanford and this sentiment is particularly strong. Every week, it seems, a new piece of software is being invented to make our lives easier. Many of these applications are spearheaded by disgruntled college students who have quickly picked up the art of mobile development. From apps to helpschedule your academic workloadtomachines that suck carbon directly out of the atmosphere, there is no shortage of technological solutions to the world’s seemingly endless supply of problems. In fact, much of Stanford’s global prestige can be attributed to its culture of rapid technological innovation — where the possibilities for ‘doing good’ are infinitely vast. Beyond pursuing start-ups, many students join Big Tech companies after they graduate. Some do so because they believe they can make the most change by piggybacking on the influence of companies such as Google, Apple, and Uber. Others are in it for the six-figure starting salaries. Even those who are skeptical of the ethical implications of working in Big Tech might believe they can force change from within, inspired by the stories of outspoken whistleblowers such as Frances Haugen and Timnit Gebru. Yet almost all of these individuals buy into the belief that technology is largely a force of good rather than evil. Even companies like Meta, which have been riddled with scandals such as data leaks and the spread of Russian disinformation, are generally perceived as lucrative workplaces with a grand vision of human connectivity. There is a word for this sentiment: ‘techno-optimism.’ Specifically, this is defined as the belief that technology plays a vital role in solving the most pressing threats to humankind. In moderation, this is a sound belief. After all, we live in a world where almost nothing is absent from the influence of brilliant feats of engineering — the Industrial Revolution has resulted in undeniable gains in efficiency and worldwide wellbeing. Yet, when taken to an extreme, this sentiment can prove destructive, in ways that fundamentally contradict technology’s initial aims. For one, an over-reliance on the belief that technology can solve existential problems can generate complacency that inhibits swift action. Take climate change, for example. When more people rely on the ‘all-in-one’ power of carbon sucking technologies or cloud-brightening initiatives, systemic causes of climate change such as fossil fuel mining and pollution are overlooked. Perhaps most illustrative of this point, billionaires such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have adopted new ‘pet projects’ of sending colonies to Mars in order to overcome the existential risks of living on Earth. Notably, this fails to directlyaddressthe immediate threat climate change poses to real humans on Earth, facing drought and other climate-related natural disasters, insteadshiftingthe problem to rest on a miracle technological solution. Is this akin to giving up? Could those billions have been spent elsewhere — to alleviate direct suffering? Unfortunately, rather than addressing the problem of climate change at its root, which would require collective action to drastically reduce the sources of pollution, many of us are waiting to be heroically saved by the Elon Musks of the world — the so-called crazy geniuses and billionaire inventors. There is even a movement called “ecomodernism” that centers on this premise: that technology is the answer to our climate crisis and technological growth can be decoupled from natural harm. Secondly, extreme optimism about technological progress can blind us to its potential perils. We are already rushing headfirst into developingsentient AI,mass facial recognition systems, andautonomous military drones. Many of these technologies have become terrifyingly good, terrifyingly fast. After all, AI development is fundamentally a race to the top — companies’ incentives are not to develop ethical inventions, but the most lucrative and ground-breaking. Moreover, technological advancements tend to directly harm vulnerable groups of individuals. For example, the Industrial Revolutionforced millions of workers into abject working conditions and livelihoods, particularly child laborers, while harnessing their labor to rapidly advance technologies. Predictive policing and AI-powered facial recognition systems disproportionatelytarget people of color. The future holds even more terrifying possibilities. Artificial supplements to human biology and gene-editing may create a new breed of transhumans, with such ‘upgrades’ only accessible to the rich. Sadly, technology often entrenches inequalities, regardless of the intentions of the creator. Part of what might be to blame for the mass migration to Big Tech could be the illusion that if you are not in the technology space, you are missing out on the latest wave of ground-breaking research. Technologists and serial entrepreneurs are touted as ‘change-makers’ and innovators. Part of this mentality arises from the grip that capitalism has on our society – it has warped our metrics of value from what benefits all of humanity to what is most profitable for a small group of elites. It is impossible to call for slower change without being labeled as ‘anti-innovation,’ and by extension, opposed to the technological utopia that is widely touted by companies like Meta. Capitalism, in short, relies on technological exploitation. The bigger, the better, so it goes. To clarify, I am not suggesting that we should put the brakes on technological progress. Rather, I suggest that we ought to think twice. Some healthy skepticism is welcome. Specifically, we should re-evaluate our metrics for what constitutes a ‘good’ innovation, shifting away from how ‘groundbreaking’ it is to considering how it will impact humanity as a collective. It’s far better to proceed with caution than to leave regulators to deal with a potentially catastrophic invention. Rather than give technology the power to determine the course of humanity, humanity must instead determine the course of technology. To do so, all of us must play our part. For one, governments and policy-makers should not shy away from regulating technology, even if it slows down the pace of technological progress. As an example, a “robot tax” could slow down the rate at which workers are displaced by automation while using the revenue to buff up unemployment benefits and potentially even retrain workers to find jobs in non-automated industries. Although this may cause AI to advance at a slower rate, workers have much to gain. More broadly, startups and corporations should actively seek out more interdisciplinary input to inform their inventions. This could look like hiring more ethicists, public policy experts, and environmentalists and giving them power in advising the direction of the company. The problem with the status quo is that many corporations appoint ‘ethicists’ merely for the PR, denying them the ability to meaningfully shape the path of the corporation. To ensure accountability, various third party organizations could be responsible for drafting up reports detailing a corporation’s estimated ethical impact on different demographic groups and on various aspects of society. In addition, NGOs such as Greenpeace or Oxfam International could release rankings of the most ‘sustainable’ or ‘net-ethical’ corporations based on the various metrics outlined in each report. Another solution is to restrict funding to ethical ventures. For example,Stanford’s Ethics and Society Review (ESR partners with the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI to mandate that research projects address potential ethical and societal risks as a requirement to access funding, and allows these projects to iteratively mitigate these risks under the guidance of an interdisciplinary faculty panel. Similar ‘ethical review’ initiatives should be implemented as standard procedure for venture capitalists and sources of corporate funding. By ensuring that money is not blindly funneled into unethical inventions, companies are incentivized to be more ethically accountable and fewer harmful technologies can come to life. As Stanford students, we are in a unique position to either contribute to these technological risks or, instead, harness them to inform what we create. There is admittedly a large, almost suffocating culture of inventing for the sake of inventing — from startup culture to the pressure to work for big corporations with big agendas. Rather than invent something because youcanor because it can sell to a consumer base, invent in order to help advance humanity as a collective. One way to do this is to have critical conversations with relevant community stakeholders about their concrete needs and determine whether your invention directly addresses those needs. Technology alone cannot solve the problems it is responsible for creating. Algorithms are merely a supplement to human flourishing, not a prerequisite. Without meaningful accountability on all fronts, technology is “but improved means to an unimproved end,” as Thoreauremarks.Progressis a deceptive word — it blurs the boundary between pure technological advancement and creating a better society. History has made it abundantly clear: not all progress is good progress."
rice_thresher_2022_25,"ByThresher Editorial Board9/6/22 11:11pm Over the summer, Rice Housing & Diningannouncedsignificant changes to the dining schedule and meal plan that went into effect at the start of the semester. The most notable change was the addition of a new meal time, affectionately known as “munch.” The other adjustment implemented the following change: “Re-entry to ANY servery requires a student to swipe to receive up to two entree plates again.” First, we want tocommendH&D for attempting to address anSA resolutionpassed last semester that called for “more flexible meal plan options.” Further, the implementation of this new meal period without causing an additional raise in meal plan price is greatly appreciated. But just a few short weeks into the semester, confusion around the new meal swipe and servery entry policies has overshadowed the improvements made to the meal plan overall. Confusion began in the first week of classes, when most students understood the policy to mean that they could only receive one plate per swipe. Admittedly, that confusion could’ve been clarified by simply reading the H&D FAQ page. But then, during the second week of classes, college presidents attempted to clarify by saying, technically, students could retrieve their second plate from the cashier after exiting the servery and eating their initial meal. Students began to follow that guidance, but H&D cashiers seemed unaware of this policy in some instances, and confusion ensued. Originally, we had planned to write this week’s editorial promoting our solution to the allocation of plates while regulating who can access the servery. We spoke to students, college presidents and staff, but it was only after speaking to David McDonald, the senior director of Rice housing and dining, that the policy became clear. According to McDonald, students can reenter the servery as many times as they’d like for drinks and portions in smaller plates and bowls that are available throughout the servery. The only line that seems to explain that policy in the FAQ states “the swipe and plate(s is the ticket to entry and once you have that it is all you care to eat.” We’re used to reading and interpreting campus policies, and we cannot connect that FAQ statement to the policy as McDonald explained it to us. We believe that the specifics of the meal swipe and servery entry policies were not made remotely clear. Students don’t know, college presidents don’t know and, by many accounts, H&D cashiers also do not fully understand these policies. The fact that it took a direct conversation with the senior director of housing and dining to clarify the servery entry policy is disappointing, to say the least. The policy, as it has been explained to us, is quite reasonable. But we call on David McDonald and H&D to send a campus-wide email clarifying the policy once and for all.

April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

thetech_mit_2022_53,"The following letter is adapted from the speech given at the MIT Vigil Rally that took place March 3. In the past week, the world has seen heroic images of Ukrainian resistance against Russian invasion. Students picking up arms to defend their homeland; civilians forming human walls to stop the enemy’s advance; Ukrainians abroad organizing awareness and fundraising campaigns; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky standing his ground, unwavering on the front lines in Kyiv. Ukrainians’ efforts have been portrayed as an act of self-defense, of patriotically defending their country against foreign invaders. What we need to realize is that Ukraine is not just fighting for itself — it is fighting for the freedom of people around the world. Just a few hours after Russia invaded Ukraine, China sent a sortie of warplanes into Taiwanese airspace. North Korea fired yet another ballistic missile. The governments of Venezuela and Myanmar are continuing their human rights abuses. These incidents continue to happen because Russia is empowering these countries. The Ukrainian army is fighting, right now, not just to defend their homeland and their people but to defend us, to defend our freedom, and to defend democracies around the world. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, and the world watched in silence: even the sacrifices of the Euromaidan protests were not sufficient for us to act. In 2019, when China killed democracy in Hong Kong and in 2020, when Belarus brutally cracked down on peaceful protesters calling for fair elections, the world stayed silent. All these events, directly or indirectly, have contributed to the war in Ukraine today. Putin is sending troops to Ukraine through Crimea and Belarus; and it is because we, as democracies, failed to act in the eight years leading up to this war that now the Ukrainian people are suffering. This war is not just about Ukraine. It is not just about Taiwan, South Korea, or some other far-away democracy that stands as the next domino to fall after Ukraine. Any country could be next. Any home, any family could wake up to the sounds of shelling and missile strikes. On March 2, Russia sent warplanes into the airspaces of Sweden and Japan. If the war in Ukraine isn’t proof enough, this further demonstrates that being an ally of the free world — even being part of NATO — is not a guarantee of safety. Even in the U.S., there are people waging a war of misinformation; there are Americans supporting Putin unapologetically; there is the looming threat of authoritarianism trying to take over. This is what we are fighting against. The current situation is not one in which we are trying to help Ukraine fight their war. It is one where brave Ukrainians are fighting our war, the war that we should be fighting in the first place. Ukrainians are fighting and dying to protect the ideals that we claim to uphold: freedom, liberty, democracy. Why is it that we are not fighting with them? The free world has been large on words and small on actions in the past eight years. While a general atmosphere of appeasement certainly played a role, it has also been frustratingly vague when it comes to “how to help.” For governments, traditional diplomacy seemed to have lost its viability. For individuals, there have been very few options beyond “raising awareness” via social media. This time, however, the movement supporting Ukraine seems to have succeeded where previous attempts have failed. Ukraine is remarkably adept at resisting their foe in this modern, digital age. Their proficiency spans all levels, from the highest echelons of government to each and every individual. President Zelensky, who won the 2019 election with a mostly virtual campaign, has forged an online persona of staunch, unwavering resistance. The Ukrainian Army has mastered the modern art of crowdfunding, which it has been practicing since 2014. Perhaps most awe-inspiring is the fortitude of individual Ukrainians, from those resisting the invasion on the front lines to those helping abroad. We see many displays of this courage here at MIT — Ukrainian members of our community who, despite bearing the pain, anger, and incessant dread of war, stood up and organized a massive ongoing campaign to offer us a chance to help. Our Ukrainian friends are doing so much to tell us exactly how we can help. They are swallowing back tears to publicly recount the atrocities committed against their families. They are resisting the urge to fly home and pick up a rifle, so that they might be able to find some help for their country abroad. They are mustering the tenacity to not constantly check the news and their messages, but instead focus on creating an entire support campaign from scratch. They are doing this for our sake, so that this time, unlike our past blunders, we actually have a chance to pull our weight in our own fight. Donate to support Ukraine — the National Bank of Ukraine has already made it as easy as clicking a few buttons, and theMIT Ukrainian community has made it even simpler. Pick up your phone. Call your representative. Demand MIT to act now. MIT as an institution has valued the critical importance of ethics in science and the significance of science in ethics. It is time for us to once again stand up for these values and ensure that our actions reflect our beliefs. MIT should continue to publicly support its Ukrainian community. The administration should disclose its ties with Russian oligarchs, Russian oil, and reconsider the ethical implications of their investments. We should also leverage our political influence as an institution to amplify the voices of our Ukrainian community, and do our best to support Ukrainian students both financially and academically. Only in such a way can we, as an academic institution, live up to our commitment towards ethics and our responsibility towards society. I am so proud of my Ukrainian friends for organizing this powerful, coordinated effort. They are doing so much just to offer us the chance to help, handed to us on a silver platter. Now, it is up to each and every one of us to act for Ukraine, and to defend ourselves. Слава Україні! Yu-Chi (Jacky Cheng ’23"

President Bidenannounced student loan cancellationfor millions of people this August, sending shockwaves around the country. The action, while being an important step for public higher education, doesn t go far enough. Public college should be free for all. To understand this, look no further than the material conditions that many students find themselves in. “My paychecks that are coming in, most of it goes toward school, Carlota Haro Haro, asophomore art major, said. So I’m over here telling my roommates, ‘I don’t get paid until Friday. Hopefully you can pitch in for toilet paper because we’re running out.’ Little things like that, or ‘I don’t have food, I ran out of food in my dorm. This is an experience familiar to many college students in the U.S.–roughly one-third of them, in fact.Food insecurity is common on college campuses, and the experience of Haro Haro illustrates that those experiences happen at ASU. She may be just one undergraduate student on campus– but if it is true that 35% of college students have had hunger impact their ability to study, as astudyjointly conducted by Chegg, Swipe Out Hunger, and the Born This Way Foundation found, approximately 27,000 ASU students could have faced food insecurity in 2020. The Biden administration’s decision to cancel some student loan debt will certainly help some borrowers,especially those with Pell Grants,but the move is not a long-term solution. “I’ve barely started school. So I still have a lot more to pay off in the future. So that does worry me a little bit,” Haro Haro said. Luckily, there is a solution that would make public higher education in the United States much more accessible. According to Brianna Westbrook, the Arizona Democratic Party Educational Coordinator and Arizona House of Representatives candidate, the solution is more than partial student loan debt cancellation. “I think (Biden s plan is great. I don’t think it goes far enough. I believe that we should cancel all student loan debt altogether and that education should be free to all of those who actively want to pursue a higher education,” Westbrook said. Yes, it is that simple– we should make public college in the U.S. free. For Arizona specifically, that would do wonders. Not only would the average student loan borrower in Arizona see$35,396 worth of debt canceled, but they also wouldn’t have to continue paying tuition payments and other fees. Haro Haro believes she would be more successful with what she is studying if she didn’t have to stress about paying for school. We’re young, she said. I just got away from home, and obviously, a lot of people are in my position, trying our best.” While the stories of students should be enough to inform us, take it fromthe Arizona Constitutionwhich clearly states that, “the university and all other state educational institutions…shall be as nearly free as possible.” That statement runs counter to the realities of going to ASU, and that is especially true for students who are a part of oppressed communities. Westbrook, herself a transgender woman, said that “I absolutely believe it would be beneficial to the LGBTQ community and trans community if it was free.” According to theUCLA School of Law and the Point Foundation, 35% of LGBTQ adults age 18 to 40 hold federal student loans, in comparison to 23% of non-LGBTQ adults. Westbrook also said that student debt cancellation would reduce the racial wealth gap, which is a claim backed up by theEducation Data Initiative. On an even larger scale, student debt cancellation and free public college would serve as a defense against fascism and strengthen people’s ability to think critically about society. “Uneducated societies are easier to manipulate, and we’re seeing a very strategic approach by the conservative right right now to take over school boards and defund public education as a whole. I think that’s one of the greatest threats to our democracy, Westbrook said. Ronald Reagan understood this when he made strong moves against free public colleges and universities,as his education advisor warned that free college was building an “educated proletariat. Student debt cancellation and free public college provide a three-pronged attack on problems at ASU and the broader U.S. public university community. They dramatically improve students’ material conditions, allowing them to focus on education instead of basic needs. They create a more inclusive, just world that treats education as a right, not a privilege. Finally, they serve as the roots of a democratic society. We should all push ASU leaders and political figures to fight to make student debt cancellation and free public college the reality.

crimson_2022_99,"It’s a Thursday night, and I’m in the Yard. It’s not too late, but just late enough for the shuttles to the Quad to be few and far between. I’m facing a dilemma that almost every Quadling grapples with daily: Do I wait for the next shuttle, or brave the weather and make the walk? To me, there’s no wrong decision. The walk gives me time to physically and mentally distance myself from the busyness of campus. The shuttle ride provides a similar opportunity, along with the increased chance of bumping into a friend. For these reasons, I absolutely love the journey to the Quad. This trek and the slight seclusion it creates make my home, Pforzheimer House, one of my favorite places on campus. No, this isn’t an advertisement for the Quad or Pforzheimer House — it is a message of appreciation for the randomness of our current housing system. Every spring, each Harvard freshman and up to seven of their friends are randomly sorted into one of the 12 upperclassmen Houses. This process has been carefully adjusted throughout the College’s existence. From the creation of the Houses in the 1930s all the way until 1995,housing assignments were preference-based, causing each House to develop a distinct reputation and attract students of similar backgrounds. The House populations were largely homogenous: the Quad housed Black and Latino students, Eliot had the wealthier, preppy students, and Kirkland served as home for the athletes. In 1995,randomizationwas introduced to the housing system, breaking the tradition of self-segregation engendered by preference-based housing. Decades later, we continue to rely on random assignment, but this system has recently been criticized. In a 2021surveyconducted by the Undergraduate Council, some students voiced renewed interest in listing House preferences or characteristics of their desired House. History cautions against reverting back to a preference-based housing system. Previously, the strong reputation of each House threatened to reduce students to a single aspect of their identity. The sequestration of students based on their identity also fractured the broader Harvard community. Today, the more well-balanced mixture within each House increases exposure to students of different backgrounds and helps to mitigate some of the social barriers faced by students belonging to marginalized groups. As a first generation, low-income student, I feel very fortunate for the opportunities presented by House life. Knowing that my House affiliation is not determined by my income or non-legacy status is comforting, and spending time with a variety of people has also helped me receive the social education that I sought when I applied to Harvard. If given the chance to surround myself with students from the same background, I am not entirely sure that I would have engaged with such a wide range of people. This brings me to my favorite aspect of randomized housing: It challenges you to learn to love your House and its community. In addition to the difficulty of abandoning my comfort zone and connecting with different people, a process which I have grown to appreciate, there are many other parts of Pforzheimer that it has taken time for me to love. I did not always love the Quad journey – what is now a meditative reprieve from my day initially frustrated me. I did not always love the horrendously slow elevator in the Comstock dorms, and I’m still learning to love the unreliable dryer that somehow always draws me back despite requiring multiple cycles to dry my clothes. I can now say that I believe Pforzheimer House is, without a doubt, the best House you could have the privilege of being assigned. But, at the same time, I am certain that the House you find yourself in is the best for you. To rising sophomores, even though you might wait with bated breath, desperately hoping for a particular House, you will love wherever you end up. You will accept the overly-friendly vermin, perpetually dirty hallway bathroom, time-consuming walk, or whatever other superficially annoying fixture you encounter. Regardless of the House and community you randomly become a part of, your House will undoubtedly become your home. Libby E. Tseng ’24, a Crimson Editorial Comp Director, lives in Pforzheimer House."
wildcat_arizona_2022_48,"A collage of screenshots from Lukas Pakter’s TikTok. *Editor’s Note:This opinions piece was originally published Sept. 19, 2022, but after a miscorrection in the copy editing process, not due to any fault of reporter Olivia Krupp, the piece was sent through a second round of copy editing before publishing again. Lukas Pakter, a University of Arizona senior, former Zeta Beta Tau fraternity president and mid-range TikTok star, always knew he’d have a platform someday. Sitting down in Starbucks, he told me everything there is to know about criticism and controversy. Essentially, he told me everything there is to know about him. “One of my friends said, ‘This is embarrassing dude, what are you doing? This is dumb,’ and I said, ‘Watch, I’ll be at 80k by the time school starts,’” Pakter said. “I hit 87k the day school started.” Pakter has no issue with confidence. His content, which he distributes each day to more than 100,000 followers, runs the gamut from fitness to motivational speaking. One day he’s dispersing bite-sized lessons he’s learned in college and another day he’s flexing in front of a mirror, espousing the sins of being fat. “Some people get upset when I say that I don’t really have that much respect for people who are morbidly obese,” Pakter said in arecent video, “and I don’t.” At first glance, his platform is predictable and contains every stereotype you’ve ever heard about someone like Pakter (or Chad, or Kyle . Still, Pakter described himself to me as both controversial and cocky, which begs the question, what could be so controversial and unique about a fraternity boy being cocky? In some ways, that depends on who you ask. For one explanation, turn to the comments section on his TikTok page, which often feels more like a shrine to his loyal followers. Many of his comment sections are overflowing with praise that reminds me of giddy fangirls, but most of these comments are not from girls — in fact, almost none of them are. His comment section is flooded predominantly with young males displaying their undying adoration and support for Pakter in the form of comments like, “Common Lukas W,” calling him a winner. Other common comments include, “This guy pulls hot chicks left and right,” “Bro I wanna be just like you” and “This kid is the man.” This type of hero worship began when Pakter posted aviral videoon how he spent half of his net worth on a gym membership as a broke college student. He described that as the video that got him started. “I thought maybe I should just post life advice. People really liked that,” Pakter told me. There’s a similar theme of adoration in Pakter’s Q&A videos, which consist of anonymous direct messages he receives on the app asking for a myriad of advice, from questions about breakups, to how to deal with social anxiety or even what to do when you have substance abuse problems. These inquiries hardly lack depth or vulnerability. With the commenters’ identities kept anonymous by Pakter, it seems that no subject is off the table. These messages and comments are easy to dismiss as silly — cringeworthy, even. It seems difficult to understand why these young guys would look up to someone they don’t even know for advice on subjects so personal. Why wouldn’t they just save these questions for their friends or better yet their therapists? Why do they see Pakter as this qualified god of knowledge who knows all? “It’s very hard for a lot of guys to come out and ask for certain advice,” Pakter said during his interview. “I think we’ve grown up in a time where there’s really not a lot of good role models for men.” In many ways, Pakter’s right. It is hard for guys to come out and ask for advice, and harder still to find positive role models. Often in the comments of his videos, some of Pakter’s followers have compared him to Andrew Tate, a famous right-wing podcaster, who infamously said that, “women are men’s property.” Similar to Pakter situation, many of Tate’s comments are filled with similar devotion and fondness, many of which come from males — young males. They are also the ones behind the large like counts of TikToks Pakter has posted, describing women in terms of“untouched,”“untapped”and“fresh.” The good role models that Pakter mentions do seem few and far between. It’s unclear whether or not he believes he is one of them. While Pakter does not compare himself to Tate, in some of his videos, he has addressed the comparisons that some other people have made between him and Tate. He prefaces calmly that what he is about to say is going to piss a lot of people off, but he doesn’t care — it’s his page. “Tate has made a lot of people a lot of money. … Even if it is degrading to these women, he is making these girls hundreds of thousands of dollars off his OnlyFans business,”Pakter said in one of his TikToksfrom August. “But he does say a lot of stuff that motivates people. Go look at his comments and see what people think of him. It’s a lot of appreciation, and ‘thank you’ and ‘you’ve changed my perspective.’” Tate does have an OnlyFans business that he runs out of Romania. It could be worth noting that Romanian police raided his home as part of a human-trafficking investigation. It is conceivable that something like that could be seen as degrading to women. “I’ve got nothing against Tate. Yeah he’s a misogynist, and he’s sexist and stuff and that’s really unfortunate,”Pakter said in another one of his TikToksfrom July, “but I do respect that he’s really honest in what he says.” Some comments on the video of Pakter speaking on Tate are in favor of both Pakter and Tate such as, “Andrew Tate is my role model,” “Tate is a win for society” or “Lukas is the blueprint.” It is important to understand what it means for young men to view these types of statements and figures as “the blueprint.” It is also important to understand why so many of these young men are left confessing their problems to less than ideal role models on the internet. “A lot of guys won’t admit their problems because they don’t wanna come off as having a weakness and so I think by me doing that it shows that everybody is normal,” Pakter told me. This is true. While a lot of these messages seem cringeworthy or silly, the implications behind them are more sad than anything else. It is undeniable that a lot of young men have a harder time speaking about their problems or reaching out for advice. A survey commissioned bythe Mental Health Foundationfound that men are statistically less likely to seek professional support or disclose a mental health problem to friends and family. From this, it can be assumed that a lot of the discussions seen on Pakter’s platform aren’t being had within male friend groups or with a positive mentor, hence the idolization of people like Pakter. While it is difficult to disagree with giving an outlet to talk about various issues young men face, like Pakter does, it is worth noting that some of his points, and the support that follows them, can be troublesome. “As a man, I think one of your primary roles is to be a protector. There’s a reason why, if the ship is sinking, the men are the last one to get off. I personally think it would be extremely unlike that of a man to say ‘let me get the lifeboat first.’ I think that’s something guys should be proud of,” Pakter said. During his interview, Pakter described his younger self as a loser and troubled. He said he had no friends and depression and that no one liked him. One could only assume how many of his young viewers share that same reality. Naturally, they don’t want to be a loser. They don’t want to get in the lifeboat first, they want to be “a man.” They see Pakter as not just some guy, but rather an image of who they could be. The social implications behind this are endless: What does it mean to be a man? What does it mean to be an alpha man? The underdog becomes the hero, and the loser becomes the man. It seems that Pakter feels he has mastered this metamorphosis. “If you think about any animal kingdom, there are alpha males or alpha females in that group dynamic. If I met someone, I could probably tell within 90 seconds what their personality is. It doesn’t have to do with looks or how tall you are. It’s simply the energy you put out and how you hold yourself,” Pakter said. Anyone could admire Pakter for letting young men know they should take pride in their masculinity, just as they could admire him for his open vulnerability online. Both are commendable and a platform like his can be progressive. Unfortunately, the idea of being “the man” or the “alpha” is often not the grand finale in the transformation of a “loser.” The obsession with being the hyper-masculine gym bro, the guy who “gets hot chicks left and right,” is nothing but a futile chase and an empty promise for a lot of these young men. If only their role models were telling them that. Follow Olivia Krupp onTwitter Olivia is a freshman who has yet to declare her major. She enjoys reading, foreign films and poetry in her free time."
crimson_2022_76,"For years, the Harvard Kennedy School’s flagship policy design course has asked students to write a plan to resume offshore drilling after the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010, in which a British Petroleum rigspewedfour million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. This past fall, one student noted the economic and environmental risks posed by the continued recklessness of the fossil fuel industry and instead suggested that the moratorium be extended. Their professor was more concerned that they hadn’t followed the prompt. The professor’s response was unsurprising to me. As an HKS student, I am accustomed to a classroom experience that reflects the influence of the fossil fuel industry on campus. Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard recently brought the scale of this influence to light in areport(which I helped to write that documented how oil and gas companies fund research and programming at multiple Harvard schools and lure faculty members to board seats and consulting projects. For example: BP has funded the aforementioned professor’s research. HKS is awash in fossil fuel money. HKS has touted taking over $1 million from Shell. The two research centers that house most of the school’s climate work — theBelfer Centerfor Science and International Affairs and theMossavar-Rahmani Centerfor Business and Government — are endowed by fossil fuel fortunes. The Harvard Environmental Economics Program isfundedby both BP and Shell. The Corporate Responsibility Initiative isfundedby ExxonMobil and Chevron. This influence shapes the intellectual life of the school. I had one classmate who attended a lecture by a well-known professor with both consulting and funding ties to the fossil fuel industry. When this student mentioned the climate impact of the growth of natural gas over the last decade and a half, the professor shut down the comment and dismissed them as a mere ideologue. Situations like this are part of a longstanding trend of the industry trying to capture academia in order to shape public opinion and serve its bottom line. An industry playbook on this strategy reads: “A regulated firm or industry should be prepared whenever possible to coopt the experts” by “hiring them as consultants or advisors, or giving them research grants and the like,” noting that the “experts themselves must not recognize that they have lost their objectivity and freedom of action.” I want to be clear: The point here is not to pillory any individual actor. For better or worse, fossil fuel companies have been the engine of the global economy for decades. The Kennedy School both cannot and should not blacklist community members with ties to the industry in an attempt at purity. The point is to illustrate the continued reach of the industry’s influence and the necessity of taking what steps we can to limit it. The administration’s response to this criticism might be that the Kennedy School prizes engagement with the world — one of the school’s taglines — over an attempt at moral purity. To which my question would be: Engagement with whom, exactly? Who gets engaged in the classroom, and who doesn’t? One of my professors, who received a multi-million dollar grant from BP, mocked the idea of protesting new fossil fuel infrastructure. That’s only laughable because, while BP can buy their way in the door, the Indigenous nations who have their treaty rightsviolatedby unwanted pipelines get frozen out of the halls of power. We will not be engaging with the African migrants who flee their homelands only tohuddlein prison camps on the fringes of Europe, or the Guatemalan farmers who see their yieldscollapsein the face of unrelenting heat and drought, or even the Gulf Coast fishermen who will never see their livelihoods recover as the oceans now turn toacidin the aftermath of BP’s crimes. As long as we continue to have a model of engagement in which we allow money to talk, we’ll only be engaging with the people who carry enough untapped carbon on their balance sheets to turn our planet into hell. Let’s be honest about what the stakes are here. The fossil fuel industry has known about the scale of the crisis, in apocalyptic detail, formore than four decades. Instead of taking steps to address the crisis, industry leaders purchased influence in government, academia, and the media in order to lie, confuse, and delay. Now, as we stand on the brink of the utter destabilization of life on our planet, they continue their time-tested strategies. At this point, the climate crisis is personal for so many of us. In just the last year, I’ve learned what it feels like to be too hot to think in the midst of an unprecedented heat wave. I’ve choked on wildfire smoke mixed with the rotting stench of a dying river. I’ve seen my sacred mountains go up in flames as my ancestral homelands on two different continents were destroyed by the floods and mudslides of an increasingly hostile planet. So as a student at the Kennedy School, I cannot help but feel that we are failing to do all we can to face the climate crisis. As both President Lawrence S. Bacow and HKS Dean Doug W. Elmendorf noted in emails last semester, Harvard’s biggest impact comes through its research and teaching. For too long, that research has been up for sale, and found eager buyers in the fossil fuel industry. It’s time to say: no more. John J. Verghese is a first-year Master’s in Public Policy student at the Harvard Kennedy School."
thetech_mit_2022_2,"To the editor, I write in response to the opinion piece that appeared Feb. 10 inThe Tech, “I’m voting yes for the Graduate Student Union because MIT continues to fail its student veterans.” My office (the Office of the Vice Chancellor serves as the primary educational point of contact for a number of key organizations at the Institute that support veterans. In the opinion piece, MIT is characterized as being unwelcoming to veterans and not responding to certain critical financial issues that impact them. The truth is that we have been collaborating with the MIT Student Veterans Association (SVA on matters our veteran students care about, specifically those issues covered in the op-ed. And, throughout the challenges we have encountered at the state and federal levels of government, MIT has directly paid our student veterans the benefits which they are due from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA , with no requirement that the benefits be paid back, even when the VA has retroactively addressed the issues. MIT continues to take these steps to this day. I want to take this opportunity to correct the record about both the recent history and current actions being taken to support our student veterans. Before I do, I will note that the recent challenges we have faced with the VA during the pandemic have made MIT’s leadership acutely aware of the intricacies of all the supporting systems, processes, and organizations involved in ensuring our student veterans get the benefits and support they are due. This was not apparent to us previously. It is now. We thank the SVA, including the author of the op-ed, for advocating for this. As a result, we have collaborated with the SVA to hire a program administrator for a new Office of Student Veteran Success. The SVA helped develop the job description and interview the candidates. This new team member, Liam Gale, a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, brings social services and program management experience, most recently in the area of health care within the VA in Bedford, MA. He will be the single point of contact for supporting MIT student veterans and interfacing with the VA and related government agencies. Liam will also be responsible for partnering with colleagues in Student Financial Services (SFS , the Office of Graduate Education, and the Office of the First Year who currently interact with our student veteran community. He will streamline and enhance MIT’s communication with, and support for, student veterans. He will also continue the monthly meetings we have been holding with the SVA to discuss student veteran support issues and will enable us to more effectively navigate the federal and state veterans affairs agencies to ensure compliance with all relevant requirements. Now moving to the facts which were inaccurate or not fully described in the op-ed. MIT has been working closely with the relevant departments and VA offices to resolve two issues: 1 our PhD program approval for GI Bill benefits and 2 an audit and pause of the approval for the Sloan and School of Engineering joint masters degree program — Leaders in Global Operations (LGO — last summer. The first issue revolves around our course catalog descriptions for PhD programs and changing VA expectations for approval. Up until January 2020,student veterans in our PhD programs were able to receive their GI bill benefits based on the information in the course catalog at the time. Then, two unrelated events occurred: a change in personnel at the VA and an audit of the LGO masters degree program. In the past, under a previous Education Liaison Representative (ELR at the VA, MIT’s doctoral programs were approved and student veterans in PhD programs were certified for GI Bill benefits without any problems. When we learned from a new ELR in early 2020 that our programs were no longer approved due to different expectations for the way we list requirements in our course catalog, we initiated the process to get them all reapproved in February 2020. All of our PhD programs were submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education (DHE for approval or reapproval in February 2020. We did not hear back for a year, which we assumed was due to the DHE being overwhelmed during the pandemic. Therefore, we resubmitted the information again in January 2021 but learned shortly after that our courses could not be processed with varying degree credit totals. Our previously approved programs were revoked and a variety of SB and SM degrees were simply not processed despite meeting VA criteria and being properly cited and submitted. We have learned through this process that the ELR requires greater detail before approving MIT’s doctoral programs and have since been iterating with them. Given our concerns over the delay in program approval, we have focused on gaining approval for the five doctoral programs in which we have had six students seeking to use their VA benefits (hoping that these will then provide a template for all of our programs to be approved . That paperwork has been submitted to the VA for approval. We hope to resolve any outstanding issues to ensure they approve our doctoral programs for benefits as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, MIT continues to make any impacted student veteran financially whole while we wait for approval. The audit of the LGO program (for a separate issue on which we were found to be fully compliant uncovered that even though LGO combined two previously approved masters programs (an SM in engineering and an MBA , the program needed to be separately authorized. The VA paused the program’s approval until we submitted the requisite information, which we did promptly. This impacted 15 veterans beginning Aug. 19, 2021. We submitted the information requested by the VA and were able to obtain authorization for the LGO program Oct. 28, 2021 (retroactive to October 2020 . MIT also offered financial support for the 15 LGO students who were affected while we were awaiting approval of that program. Just as we have ensured that any doctoral student veteran seeking benefits is provided with the equivalent financial support that they would have received from the VA during this interim period, we notified the 15 LGO students mentioned inThe Techthat MIT would provide them with the equivalent of their monthly housing allowance from the VA until the issue with their program approval was resolved. MIT provided the students with this funding. Working with SFS, Sloan also arranged to shield students from late penalties and notified them that the funds they received would not need to be repaid to MIT. Additionally, all PhD student veterans were informed by the SVA about this situation, and we encouraged them to reach out for assistance. To date, we are aware of six impacted students across five doctoral programs, but if you are reading this and wondering if you could benefit from this support, please reach out to the VA atva@mit.eduor to me personally. We work hard to ensure that all students feel valued, involved, and informed about issues impacting their life and work at the Institute. This is particularly true for our student veterans, who we know deal with unique challenges related to the intricacies of all the supporting systems, processes, and organizations involved in facilitating their government benefits. If any veteran or community member on campus has a question, concern, or problem, they can always contact me. My door has been, and will continue to be, open. Sincerely, Ian A. WaitzVice Chancellor for Undergraduate and Graduate Education"
thetech_mit_2022_45,"Fellow MIT Graduate Students, On April 4–5, we will vote on whether we wish for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE to represent us. Voting yes would bind us for years to come to UE, an organization that, in addition to being afiscally irresponsible choice, holdsmany positions that are unrepresentative of MIT graduate students. To list just a few: Theydo not supportnuclear power. They denounce collaborations with U.S. allies such asIsraelandJapan. Theysupport Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, claiming that “the U.S. government and media continue to vilify his government as a ‘dictatorship.’” Needless to say, there is no media conspiracy. According to apiece inThe New York Times, the “Maduro administration has been responsible for… plunging the country into a deep humanitarian crisis. … He has also attempted to crush the opposition by jailing or exiling critics, and using lethal force against anti-government protesters.” They wereagainst the expansion of NATO and Obama s supportof the2014 Ukrainian revolution, which overthrew Putin’s puppet government in Ukraine.

state_press_2022_10,"The transfer portal has been commendable for the Sun Devils, a football team that needs an extra boost of talent after a very lackluster high school recruiting season. The Sun Devils are ranked103 in thenation in high school recruiting and hold the last spot in the Pac-12 conference. Where they lack in high school recruiting, they make up for in transfer portal signings. The fact ASU had to recruit from the transfer portal is worse for the team, because yes, while you get more experienced players, experience means older, and older means the team will lose players to the draft sooner than players recruited out of high school. Former Sun Devil quarterback Jayden Daniels is a great example of someone who was recruited out of high school who went on to have a great Sun Devil career over his three years with the program. Someone who transfers to a school has less time with the program and the coaching staff. Yes, there may be outliers like Joe Burrow who transferred from Ohio State to Louisiana State where he threw for 8,565 yards and 76 touchdowns. Burrow also led LSU to a national title in 2019. But most transfers have to settle into a team s system to make the most impact. And most transfers don t have the luxury of having many years to make that transition, either. ASU songoing recruitment scandallikely led to the lack of success in recruiting high school athletes, leading the program to look to the transfer portal. ASU pulled together a strong class this past year, with the group of transfersbeing ranked 16th in the nation. Head coachHerm Edwardsmade the shift in strategy knowing the portal was a viable option. He praised the portal in the past as a means to recruit talent, calling it college football s free agency. Arguably the most notable signing in the program s most recent class was Paul Tyson, a former 4-star quarterback from Alabama. With the departure ofJayden Daniels toLSU this season, Tyson looks to compete for the starting quarterback spot, and he will use the knowledge he s gained from being the backup to now NFL quarterback Mac Jones and Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young to help him this spring. But Tyson wasn t the only transfer athlete who decided to play in Tempe this coming fall. Emmit Bohle, an incoming offensive lineman from Northern State said he chose to come to ASU because,A big thing for me was the opportunity and getting to play here at Arizona State with a coach like coach (Kevin Mawae and the development I can do here. He said being in a bigger city like Tempe opens up a lot of opportunities and connections that are around a bigger city, but Bohle seems focused on the task at hand, as he said, At the end of the day it s still just football. I m here to play football. Along with the additions of Tyson and Bohle, ASU has also landed defensive linemanNesta Jade Silverafrom Miami. A former 4-star recruit, Jade Silvera will fit in nicely with Jermayne Lole who is recovering from an injury he suffered last season. However, all but one of the transfers the Sun Devils recruited are upperclassmen. ASU will very likely lose many of them after this year. While ASU compensated for theworstrecruiting class in school history with a strong transfer class, the team will only be able to reap the benefits of its efforts for a short time. The program putting all of its eggs into the hypothetical transfer portal basket shouldn t be viewed as a long-term recruiting strategy.

crimson_2022_165,"Let me begin with an uncontroversial claim: There is virtue in humility and in seeking to understand other people’s motives. No one disputes this on its face. Surely, most can agree that rejecting this principle would toxify our civic life and cripple our effort to coexist harmoniously. But every day, in school, politics, and social life, we eschew moderation and attempts to understand in favor of indignation and disgust — even at institutions dedicated to seeking truth. Take originalism, the preferred interpretive framework of most of the Supreme Court’s conservative justices and the basis for itsrecent decisionin Dobbs v. Jackson overturning the constitutional right to abortion. When Roe v. Wade fell, The Crimson Editorial Boardissueda scathing condemnation of the majority’s conclusion. That piece, as with much other protest, was strongest when it was moral, highlighting the importance of the right to the health and autonomy of women. But in equal measure, the piece was weakest when it was legal. This Board did not mince words about the “farcical legal theatre” behind the opinion, reflecting its apparent belief that there is no legal basis for the decision. Accordingly, it made only casual use of technical terms like “fundamental right” at the heart of long-running doctrinal debates to draw sweeping legal conclusions that its reasoning could not support. This needlessly obscured the powerful moral argument at the heart of the piece: that women’s bodies should not be conscripted to carry unwanted children to term. It is, of course, entirely reasonable to have serious grievances with the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson, and that doesn’t require any knowledge of the law. But how many Harvard students have engaged with the judicial philosophy that underpins it? Instead of truly interrogating why originalists think the way they do, we have reduced a complex legal ideology, worthy of our scrutiny and critique, to “gaseous misogyny.” As the vitriol of the culture wars has grown more venomous, our natural response has been mistrust – an utter lack of faith that those with whom we disagree are acting in good faith. While not always unwarranted, it has contaminated every corner of American life. This especially includes how we talk to one another. Quality discourse requires believing that the other has something of value to say. It is difficult to possess this kind of intellectual humility when one’s opponents appear so ill-intentioned and, well, wrong. It is easy, by contrast, to feel humble when our convictions seem incontestable. To many, pro-choice attitudes can only result from a callous indifference to life, or pro-life views from a misogynistic sort of religious dogmatism. Do not take me to mean that people should not feel galvanized, even disgusted, about political affairs. Political beliefs are expressions of deeply personal, important values and experiences that are worth fighting for. Few issues exemplify this more strongly than the right to abortion. My fear, rather, is that mistrust has led us to lose sight of powerful, politically neutral principles essential to living together constructively. I believe that recommitting to the following two maxims would go a long way towards healing our culture: One, embodying intellectual humility does not require one to believe that they are wrong, and two, charitably interpreting the motives of those with whom one disagrees does not require compromising one’s deeply held beliefs. The understanding that no one person has every answer is an essential counterbalance to the excesses of passion and purpose. Often, being more attuned to why people think what they think will not reverse one’s beliefs or even substantially alter them. But the very act of listening allows us to distinguish the vast majority of our ideological opponents from the worst of their partisans. To be clear, being charitable to the stated motives of others does not deny the reality that many individuals do not act in good faith. I am not suggesting, for instance, that you take Senator Josh Hawley’s tweets at face value. I am also under no illusion that your ideological opponents will always extend this same courtesy to you. But why would they ever do so if nobody made an effort? To disarm other people’s instinct to distrust, we must signal that we are willing to engage, not without qualification, but with an open ear and genuine desire to understand. Both of these principles require us to affirmatively choose trust. That won’t be easy. But I believe adopting them is the only way for us to exit this vicious cycle of ideological polarization. If we can move away from the notion that those in our lives with seriously different views are bad people, fundamentally incompatible with us in civic and social life, we can both reinvigorate our political discourse and more fully realize the benefits of our diversity. Our nation has more than 330 million people. Collectively, we represent far too broad a range of values and experiences to prosper in a culture that lionizes “owning the libs” andpunishes compromise. This means you should speak your mind — about Dobbs v. Jackson or whatever else draws your fervor. But try having trust, too. See what insights it allows you to uncover. Our fracturing political system depends on it. Lucas T. Gazianis ’24, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Currier House."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_38,"Japanese American indie music artist Mitski — full name Mitski Miyawaki — recently discussed the downfalls of being an artist in aninterviewwith Vulture. She mentioned the repetitive and dehumanizing nature of being exploited as an artist, stating “you have to be a product that’s being bought and sold and consumed, and you have to perceive yourself that way in order to function.” In a society where consumers are increasingly digesting artists’ work through the media, we need to realize our impact on the individuals that create the art we so regularly enjoy. Whether it’s musicians like Mitski or other performers, artists and writers, many are often subjected to giving themselves up in the process of producing art for the public. For Mitski, surviving in the music industry meant ignoring her personal boundaries, even to the point of almost quitting music. Her perspective questions the treatment of artists and how they are often reduced to a product in a way that separates them from their humanity. “M y heart really did start to go numb and go silent. And the problem with that is that I actually need my heart — my feelings — in order to write music. It was this paradox,” Mitski said in a Rolling Stoneinterview. Artists are expected to be vulnerable and open about the inner motivations behind their art while in the spotlight, yet are simultaneously expected to cater their art towards something that is easily understandable to the general public. Artists in every type of medium — music, film, writing, etc. — are often creatively exploited, either by theirmusic labelor simply due toagreementsnot being honored. Musicians are sometimes required to fillquotasas well. This means they would have to create a certain number of records, art pieces, films or any other medium they work with in order to satisfy and meet the demands of the companies they work under. Yet, these companies tend to focus more on the profits of an artist’s work rather than the mental strain creating vulnerable pieces can cause. In 2020, rapperYe— formerly known as Kanye West — pointed out how record label contractsexploitmusicians by commodifying their work: not paying them wages as workers but instead as independent contractors. Due to this, artists are forced to continue making art that can be mentally strenuous in addition to satisfying their management. More and more, musicians are being exploited solely for profits by record labels and lose freedom in the work they produce. Companies lose sight of the work itself and the person behind the work in favor of greed. One major example is with singer-songwriterTaylor Swift, who is currently re-recording all of her albums after controversy over her previous record label, Big Machine Records, about owning her songs. In the contemporary art world, the same sentiments can be felt by artists who focus on physical art pieces like painting and sculpting. Artists are expected to create pieces that will succeed, often giving themselves up in the process — either mentally or physically — through the amount of pressure and work they put themselves through for their work. Additionally, the commodification of art has led to its loss of meaning. For example,contemporary arttoday is frequently being seen as a status symbol, purchased solely to signify wealth. This leads to the artist’s motivations behind the work to be cast aside. “Contemporary art has become a commodity. Some people are buying with their egos, not their eyes,” Sotheby’s Institute of Art Contemporary Art Program Director Kathy Battistasaid. On top of the creative exploitation of artists, especially those that are more frequently in the spotlight, artists also have to deal with beingfictionalizedby fans. Artists who quickly climb the viral charts may be forced into the spotlight and into sharing parts of themselves or their work that they aren’t ready to share. One example is when singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo, who quickly went viral over her album “Sour,” was forced to deal with online fansdissectingher love life. It’s important for any fan or consumer of art to know that the musicians, writers, performers or any other artist that we enjoy regularly are human beings too. As consumers, we need to know where to draw the line between being obsessed with an artist and admiring their work from afar. We shouldn’t pressure artists to release new work or reduce their work to be easily explainable to us. Sometimes art is meant to be enjoyed and appreciated, while sometimes it is meant to be not even completely understood but instead up to our own interpretation.

crimson_2022_60,"A new year, a new professor’s abuses exposed. In my freshman year, we were collectively horrified by the news of Government professorJorge I. Dominguez’ssexual offenses. My sophomore year, our horror turned to Economics professorRoland G. Fryer, Jr. And now, in my senior year, we’re talking about Anthropology professorJohn L. Comaroff. Amid ongoing abuses, students have taken these professors’ classes and been assigned their readings. From these recent cases alone, it is abundantly clear that when it comes to faculty who have committed sexual offenses, Harvard’s hiring and disciplinary practices have forced students to face unfair, harmful, and frustrating choices. Do we submit ourselves to inherently power-imbalanced relationships with those who have a history of emotionally or physically abusing people that look like us? Should we enter a class where we might expect to be discriminated against? Which of our professors are currently harming students and are just a Crimson article away from being exposed? Whom should we avoid being alone with in office hours? What do we lose when we are forced to give up a powerful connection or a prestigious letter of recommendation? Do our identities preclude us from the possibility of meaningful relationships with some professors altogether? As students, we shouldn’t be forced to decide between our academic and career aspirations and our safety. Even if a professor never harms us directly, it is psychologically traumatizing to face — let alone be immediately subordinate to — someone who has a history of objectifying, sexually assaulting, or discriminating against people like us. Perhaps equally as insidious as a handful of discriminatory and abusive professors is the apparent widespread tolerance of perpetrators, both new and old, at the College. The 38 faculty members who signed a letterdisputing Comaroff’s forced unpaid leaveeffectively discredited the women brave enough to speak up. These 38 professors claimed to be concerned about the effects of the Comaroff decision on their “ability to advise their own students.” This would be hilariously ironic if it wasn’t such a disturbing betrayal. If these professors were so worried about being good mentors and advisors, they wouldn’t undermine students who have been victimized. To those professors: I, too, am worried about your ability to advise your own students. The open letter disputing Comaroff’s unpaid leave praises his great influence while expressing “dismay” at his punishment. This argument on Comaroff’s behalf aligns with the University’s priorities all too well. Harvard’s slap-on-the-wrist responses to abuses of power demonstrate that for the University, ethics often take a backseat to ‘brilliance’ and intellectual progress. Harvard knew about Comaroff’s abusive habits before they hired him, according to the lawsuitrecently filedby three graduate students in the Anthropology department. In 2010, Harvardrehiredrenowned economic expert Lawrence H. Summers as a professor even though he hadresignedfrom his position as University President in 2006 following an uproar over hissexist comments, in which he suggestedthat women are naturally worse at STEM subjects than men. Harvard allowed Fryer, a rising star in the field of economics, to return to teach undergraduates despite the fact that hesexually harassed subordinates. Harvard virtually ignored years of disturbing abuse at the hands of Dominguez until, after he hadalready retiredfrom his position in the Government department, they belatedlystripped himof “emeritus status.” And these are merely cases that have made it into The Crimson in recent times. Just as we carefully require rules of ethics in scientific discovery, we must not let the intellectual feats of “star” faculty overshadow our ethical obligations to student safety. As summarized in the graduate student lawsuit, Harvard’s current system is “designed to protect the University, its reputation, and the faculty who sustain that reputation at the expense of its students.” Harvard must not tolerate or dismiss discrimination and harm, and while I believe that people can change, the risks and injustices of quickly forgiving and forgetting faculty abuses are high. And frankly, students shouldn’t be the guinea pigs for historically harmful professors’ character growth. I appreciate the facultyresponse letter— signed by nearly twice as many faculty as the first — which condemns the open letter supporting Comaroff. I am warily grateful for the manyretractionsfrom the signers of that original open letter. I’ve been touched and heartened by the tenacious work of my co-organizers in Our Harvard Can Do Better and HGSU’s Feminist Working Group as we’ve mobilized for change at Harvard. I hope that together, we can root out Harvard’s poisonously permissive practices that have repeatedly placed students at risk. Ultimately, we, as a Harvard community — administrators, tenured faculty, undergraduates, deans, graduate students, house administrators, all of us — must not prioritize intelligence over ethics, reputation over truth, personal job security over believing survivors, or our ambitions over our own dignity and safety.

rice_thresher_2022_64,"ByMatthew Sheets1/25/22 11:20pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. In September 2019, nearly 100 students stormed the field at Rice Stadium during the halftime show for a football game against Baylor University. Wielding pride flags, volunteers led by our iconic Marching Owl Band protestedBaylor’s refusal to recognize Gamma Alpha Upsilon, the then-unofficial LGBTQ student alliance at Baylor. Being a part of the demonstration myself, I remember hearing a mixture of cheers and boos from spectators. However, I felt encouraged that Rice had used its platform for good by spreading awareness of anti-LGBTQ policies at Baylor and making it clear that bigotry was not welcome within the hedges. Despite an outpouring of support for MOB’s halftime show from the public (the demonstration was featured in several publications including Houston Chronicle, Newsweek, LGBTQ Nation, etc. , Rice’s administration was silent on the matter. Indeed, rather than showing support for students’ pro-LGBTQ demonstration, Rice instead announced anupcoming football serieswith the Latter-day Saint-affiliated Brigham Young University only three days after the Baylor game. BYU is known nationally for its anti-LGBTQ policies, and it is disheartening to see Rice publicly align itself with an institution so fundamentally divergent from Rice’s values. The football series, consisting of games in 2023 and 2025, was added to the schedule quietly but the message was loud and clear: Rice Athletics — and the administration at large — is not concerned about anti-LGBTQ policies, at least not when money is on the line. Such policies are antithetical to Rice’s community values of LGBTQ equality and acceptance. As such, I call on Rice to sever athletic ties with BYU. While it is unfortunate when Rice athletically associates with any homophobic or transphobic university, the BYU partnership in particular stings as a queer student. For context, BYU has a ban on “same sex romantic behavior”, including holding hands, kissing and dating. The harassment of queer students at BYU, however, goes much further. A recent lesbian graduatelost her on-campus jobfor not appearing “feminine enough” to her boss. Last year, a professorcalled a queer student a term associated with the anti-Christ. Transitioning can result inexpulsion. Queer applicants can be denied admission or scholarships. And all LGBTQ students live in constant fear of disciplinary action — including expulsion — should they “act on” their queer identities. To this day, Rice Athletics continues to affiliate with, and provide tacit acceptance to, institutions of higher learning that fail to see LGBTQ individuals as fully human. Rice’s institutional complacency with regard to LGBTQ equality sends a message both to queer students at Rice and those suffering under homophobic regimes at other universities: We are just fine with your human rights being violated. Further demonstrating this attitude is Rice’s frequent competition with other Title IX exempt institutions including Baylor and Houston Baptist. Title IX exempt schools receive free passes to discriminate based on sex from the U.S. Department of Education, often leading tounsafe conditionsfor women and gender-sexual minorities. More than “just another Title IX exempt school,” BYU is the originator of the Title IX exemption as a concept (which has been mimicked by other anti-LGBTQ schools and is currentlyunder investigationby the Department of Education due to LGBTQ discrimination so severe it goes beyond the exemption. In the spirit of JFK’s 1962 speech on Rice’s own campus, we must take a stand for equality on the national level not because it is easy, but because it is hard. Rice’s frequent, voluntary association with institutions espousing openly homophobic and transphobic ideas flies in the face ofRice’s missionof “cultivating a diverse community ... that produces leaders across the spectrum of human endeavor.” Rice’s recent shift to the American Athletic Conference will generate increased interest and visibility for our athletic program. More than ever before, each time Rice competes with BYU we are putting money and legitimacy directly into the pockets of an institution that actively dehumanizes queer people. We are complicit. We must also consider Rice’s willingness to put our own LGBTQ student athletes into potentially harmful environments at their competitions. The boos coming from Baylor fans during our pride-themed halftime show tell us all we need to know about the kinds of places into which our athletes are being sent. In the 1970s, many universitiessevered athletic relations with BYUfor its racist views and policies, which led to positive changes there. These moves were made with an understanding of the moral responsibility to stand for truth rather than continuing to tolerate the bigotry of the past. Those schools recognized that nonwhite students were an integral part of their teams, student bodies and broader communities. Now, 50 years later, it is time that we also recognize LGBTQ individuals as people worth fighting for. Thus, I call on Rice University to cease athletic competition, wherever possible, with Brigham Young University on the grounds of anti-LGBTQ actions, policies, and statements. Further, I call on fellow Rice students to make their voices heard, letting the administration know that associating with this anti-LGBTQ institution is wrong. At its best Rice is a powerful voice for positive change, and this outcome is most likely when students act in pursuit of equality, justice, and moral courage. College athletics have normalized homophobia and transphobia for long enough, and we each have a chance to be a part of changing that. The time to act is now. “BE BOLD,” say the giant signs across campus. It would be nice to think this invitation is about more than just fundraising. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

thetech_mit_2022_12,"Every IAP and summer, a little-known date passes that determines whether students will be hit with an $85 fee — thelate pre-registration fee. Just a few days ago, Jan. 13, 2022, while some students were on internships or off-campus, students who had not pre-registered for classes received an $85 fee charged to their student accounts (students typically find out they were charged a few weeks after the deadline, when their student account bills are posted . Pre-registration is the process by which students preliminarily sign up for classes, communicating a student s intent to take courses. The exact number of people who receive the fine is unclear, but a conservative estimate of 1% of students receiving this fee would lead to over $10,000 in fees annually. While a very small amount compared to MIT’s multi-billion-dollar budget, an unexpected $85 fee is significant to students, especially those struggling financially with student loans or a high cost of living. But what makes this fee hidden? Why are students not well aware of this deadline or fee? For one, the registrar sends onlyoneemail, over a month before the deadline, informing students about the upcoming pre-registration period and late fee. There are no subsequent reminder emails or check-ins as the deadline approaches. To make matters worse, that email is sent one day before pre-registration actually begins, which means that even if students read the email and want to pre-register, they must wait one day before proceeding with pre-registration. On top of that, the email does not contain any link to the pre-registration website, adding one more barrier to pre-registering. Second, the registrar does not directly email students about the deadline. Instead, the registrar emails graduate administrators with the expectation that they will forward the email, effectively absolving themselves of the responsibility to remind students of the fee. Meanwhile, the graduate administrators are expected to keep this deadline in mind and remind students of it while they continue running an entire department. Finally, pre-registration is rarely on a student’s radar in the middle of the summer or IAP. Undergraduates are off-campus over the summer doing internships or taking a break, and often, graduate students are not even enrolled in courses or aware of the academic schedule. The purpose and necessity of the fee in itself is questionable. Presumably, the purpose of the fee is to encourage students to inform MIT of theirintentto take courses (recall this is for pre-registration, not registration itself . For example, MIT may need an estimate of course enrollment so that it can reserve rooms and allocate teaching roles. The purpose of the fee would then be to encourage students to fill out the pre-registration with enough time for MIT to prepare for the semester. This rationale is tenuous for three reasons. First, if studentsare not even awareof the fee or deadline, then the fee itself is ineffective in changing student behaviors. Given that pre-registration requires no commitment from the student, it is unlikely that students are intentionally not pre-registering or procrastinating on a difficult decision (that will happen on add/drop date . Second, many graduate students are registering only for thesis units, known as “.THG”, which have no bearing on classroom or teaching employment, thus making pre-registration unnecessary, or at least superfluous, for the thousands of graduate students enrolled at MIT. Finally, if the goal is to encourage students to pre-register, one would expect MIT, at a minimum, to already employ non-fee-based methods for ensuring students pre-register, such as emailing closer to the deadline or sending targeted emails to those who have yet to pre-register. This inaction leads to missed pre-registrations and student fees, and more importantly, it means that MIT is unable to get the information they presumably want before the registration period begins. What should MIT do? First, the registrar’s office should directly contact and warn students of an upcoming fee. This should lie within the registrar’s responsibility, since they conveniently have access toboththe email addresses and the registration status of all MIT students. A common reason given for not emailing more frequently is that students receive too many emails already. However, I suspect an additional few emails would be appreciated by students if it means avoiding an $85 fee (and if we’re going to reduce mass emails, we should reduce random event publicity or outreach from recruiters, not important information from the Institute . More broadly, as an institute focused on innovation and science, MIT should be looking into less punitive and more effective methods to ensure students are pre-registering, such as targeted reminders and improved communications. MIT could also consider looking at theirpeer schools— who have moved their late fees much closer to the beginning of the semester, when students are thinking about registration — or tolibraries across the countrywhich have gotten rid of late fees altogether, due to reports showing the unequal financial burden posed to lower-income patrons. At the end of the day, MIT has a responsibility to ensure that classes run smoothly every semester. MIT also has a responsibility to its students to ensure that the Institute’s actions (or inactions are not leading to a hidden tax on the student population. Currently, are they effectively holding up either of these responsibilities? Noam BuckmanBS ’16, MS ’18, PhD ’22 (expected"
crimson_2022_132,"“What time is it on the clock of the world?” The Chinese American philosopher and Detroit-based community activist, Grace Lee Boggs, posed this question at the beginning of public events in the late 1900s and early 2000s. Hers was a piercing question, a prescient question, which compelled members of her audiences, me among them, to take note of our global moments and recognize states of urgency. Since then, the alarm on Grace Lee Boggs’ proverbial clock has been incessantly ringing. Perhaps it is clanging most loudly for you, dear and cherished members of the Harvard Classes of 2022, 2021, and 2020. You have spent the last few years reeling from the physical and emotional costs of a global pandemic and the social disruptions it wrought. You have seen political upheavals previously unthinkable here in the United States, the vulnerability of American democracy, an erosion of rights secured long before you were born, a rise in racist and antisemitic violence, and a series of extreme weather crises that indicate a dangerously changing climate. You have observed the swift deterioration of national stability in Europe, increased violence in the Middle East, and a rise in authoritarian rhetoric and leadership around the world. You have witnessed for yourself truths that you surely learned at Harvard — that the globe is intricately interconnected, societies are excruciatingly complex, and human beings are tragically flawed. And you have watched your elders — statesmen and women, financiers and entrepreneurs, the people in charge of governments and international institutions — straining for solutions to staggering moral and material dilemmas. You have even learned in recent weeks that your alma mater holds responsibility for the historical enslavement of at least 70 souls — grandchildren, grandparents, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles — and has ties to individuals responsible for the dispossession, exile, sale, and captivity of many more people across New England, the American South, and the Caribbean. You now know that all you have gained here at heralded Harvard — in illuminated knowledge, in lifelong friendship, in unparalleled opportunity for rich, full, and resourced lives — stands in stark contrast to all that was stolen from populations in the past. You may feel dazed by these revelations, disclosures, and betrayals. If so, you are not alone. The hallmark of our time seems to be destabilization and fragmentation, profound disorientation, and the dimming of collective civic lights. And what are you to do with all this? How are you to stride through the ornate gates of Harvard Yard and enter this chaotic world without getting lost in the storm of uncertainty? Let’s ask Harriet Tubman. I will venture a guess that you know the name of one of African America’s legendary freedom fighters. Some of you may also know that this is the 200th anniversary of Harriet Tubman’s birth on the eastern shore of Maryland in 1822. She was born into chattel slavery, separated from her parents as a young child, and neglected and abused by the various people who legally owned or rented her. Her skin color consigned her to subjugation. Her caste was inherited and heritable. She grew up in a system and society that offered no hope for her wellbeing. Tubman’s situation was desperate, until she changed it. Harriet Tubman saved hundreds from enslavement, but she started with herself. She learned all she could in the context of community, through the love and guidance of her family. She identified her enslavement and the captivity of those around her as an egregious wrong, and she acted to combat that wrong by escaping to the North. To accomplish this, she had to identify allies, walk close to a hundred miles, and navigate through hostile territory in the dead of night. Harriet Tubman oriented by way of the sky. She mapped her escape route by setting her sights on the North Star. PhysicistChanda R. S. H. Prescod-Weinstein ’03describes Harriet Tubman’s use of Polaris as “a natural compass.” Tubman also moved in accordance with an ethical compass, doing what she believed was right in her heart and mind. She was sharp, brave, and resilient. She was, at the same time, exhausted by her strenuous efforts, pained by a childhood injury that resulted in a disability, and traumatized by the loss of her older sisters to sale. In other words, she was human. After she freed herself, Tubman returned South to rescue relatives and compatriots, relying on a secret network of fellow freedom fighters. She aided approximately 70 people, leading small groups through dark forests and across cold creeks. During the U.S. Civil War, she commanded a Union Army attack on rice plantations along South Carolina’s Combahee River, freeing nearly 800 people from bondage. Perhaps Harriet Tubman realized that amid chaos and uncertainty, there is no way out but forward. She had faith in her ability to change her society for the better, and hundreds of people had faith in her. Classes of 2022, 2021, and 2020: I have faith in you. You are sharp. You are brave. You are resilient. What time is it on the clock of the world? Your time. It is your time to chart the stars and fly hard and fast until you grab them, raining down light on this tainted ground that you will inherit. Congratulations on your graduation and all the goodness you will bring to our broken, yet beautiful, world.

state_press_2022_47,"Despite experts emphasizing the importance of water in Arizona, politicians cast the topic aside in favor of other policies. Arizona is facing its worst drought in 1,200 years, but the state s water crisis isn t receiving the urgent political coverage and care it deserves. After water levels in Lake Mead reached a historic low, the Bureau of Reclamation announced that it wouldcut Arizona’s river allotmentby 21 percent, increasing water loss by 80,000 acre-feet from 2022. Astudypublished in February notes that these extreme drought conditions will likely persist through 2023, with human-induced climate change single-handedly putting the Southwest on a megadrought trajectory. Although Arizona has implemented manywater conservation efforts, it still needs policy reform and attention. We need innovative new approaches, said Rhett Larson, the Richard Morrison Professor of Water Law at Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law. The shortage at this point is so serious that whatever we’ve been doing in the past is not good enough going forward. Larson mentioned that permanent conservation measures such as using low-flow toilets and showers and removing decorative turf “will only get us so far” in the fight to preserve Arizona’s water supply. The vast majority of the water is used by agriculture, so even if the cities and houses made all of these fixes, it wouldn’t be enough, Larson said. Additionally, not all parts of Arizona manage water equally – a concern that Kathryn Sorensen, the director of research at the Kyl Center for Water Policy, elaborated on. We have really strong, really progressive water management in central Arizona, but those rules don t apply statewide, Sorensen said. It would be nice if rural communities had some additional tools that enabled them to better manage groundwater. On the topic of water receiving minimal political coverage, Sorensen and Larson offered several perspectives. Water issues don t tend to capture public interest unless there s a crisis, Sorensen said. It s a bit of a challenge. According to Larsen, as our economy has diversified from being grounded in agriculture and ranching, fewer and fewer of our civic leaders are coming from sectors that understand water, and so fewer and fewer are really water literate. Although both Sorensen and Larson attribute the blame to general Arizona voters for not caring enough about water issues, empirical evidence suggests otherwise.73 percentof likely voters are concerned about long-term water supplies, and prioritize sustaining waterways and rural agriculture. It’s clear that Arizonans are aware of the water crisis in the Southwest. It’s also becoming clear that Arizona politicians are not doing enough to protect our water supply against worsening conditions. Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, who is up for reelection this Tuesday, has identified securing Arizona s water future as one of his priorities. Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters proposed solutions to addressing the state s water crisis including building pipelines and desalination plants, but he has not identified the water crisis as a priority in his campaign. Even though Arizona’s water management system is exceptional, climate change is moving the goalposts, and more ambitious and effective policies need to be implemented to ensure that Arizona has water for generations to come. The only way to do that is to go out andvoteon November 8 and to hold politicians accountable for addressing the water crisis. Edited by Sadie Buggle, David Rodish and Kristen Apolline Castillo.

rice_thresher_2022_33,"BySavannah Kuchar4/19/22 11:11pm This week marks the last issue of the Thresher for the year, and for the seniors like myself, our last issue ever. I have been a part of the Thresher since freshman year. And it would not be an exaggeration to say it has defined my Rice experience. As someone pursuing a career in journalism after graduation, there has been no better place to learn than at this paper. The Thresher is a job by definition (yes, we pay; no, not well . But it is also the place I have met some of my best friends and formed some of my favorite memories. Speaking to the journalism experience, the Thresher is a student media group, and in my four years I’ve seen how important both of those words are. We get a lot of attention for being “media,” and as a group with a large campus presence and channels to communicate with a majority of the broader Rice community, it’s important we take this seriously. The other part of that is “student.” We are students first and we are constantly learning in our roles with the Thresher. Because we want to be held accountable by the community, we value feedback from readers as the best way for us to learn and grow and make sure the paper continues to fulfill its role on campus. It might surprise some people to know just how open we are to hearing this feedback. If you have thoughts, comments, questions or criticisms, please send us an email or even reach out to a staffer if you know someone. Deviating now, because it is my farewell note and my last chance to write from the editor’s desk, I’m stealing a page from mypredecessor’sbook to write some personal thank yous. Firstly, to Ben Baker-Katz, a wonderful managing editor and co-leader: thank you for helping share the stress of Tuesday nights and being just an incredible friend over this past year. I cannot wait to see what you and the amazing Morgan Gage do together in the role next year. Thank you Ivanka Perez for both your friendship and sage wisdom. Along with Rishab Ramapriyan and Christina Tan, you were my role models coming into this position, and I’m ever grateful for that extra semester I had to work with you last fall. This job would’ve been nothing without everyone on staff, especially the seniors, who made the office so lively and weekly operations so successful. We came back to a largely in-person format after over a year of remote work and the year was better than anything I could’ve expected. Thank you also to Katharine Shilcutt for stepping in as adviser in such difficult circumstances and being a blessing to all of us in student media. And finally, thank you Kelley Lash. I wish more than anything that I could say all of this in person, but you were the greatest adviser and mentor, and the reason student media was such an amazing and supportive place in the first place. Though I won’t be there to see it firsthand after this week, I know the Thresher will carry on your legacy and make you proud. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_37,"One October afternoon, as has become habit, I found myself walking to a nearby coffee shop between classes. Amid all the busyness of life, I have gratefully welcomed these momentary, unscheduled strolls. They promise time for reflection, a chance to feel the autumn air as it gradually cools and yields to winter, and, of course, a warm, tasty beverage to stave off a caffeine-deprivation-induced headache. On this particular autumn day, I especially welcomed the chance to let my mind wander — I had just read about yet another set of climate activists throwing food at famous paintings, and as I began to process my initial shock and anger, I was beginning to find this form of unconventional protest intriguing. As someone in love with the visual arts, the sight of a van Gogh drenched in tomato soup or a Monet coated in mashed potatoes had my stomach in knots. But equally troubling to me was the ultimatum one of the climate activistsprofessed: Art or life? A moral quandary as profound as this one should neither be problematized nor answered in so few words. When the food was cleaned and the paintings restored, the difficult question of art or life lingered. I had to deal with it. I do not find this question pressing because the answer is obviously life; rather, I find it pressing precisely because I have a sneaking suspicion that maybe it isn’t. Part of what makes life worth preserving is that life is valuable, and it’s hard not to feel that what makes human life valuable is our species’ profound legacy, artistic creation included. Sure, these protests targeting art come at a time when the planet is quickly inching toward inhabitability, and one could argue that they shed light and urgency on the climate crisis. But putting the politics aside for a moment, I invite you to consider the complex debate over the values at play. The age-old question of balancing moral judgments evokes a philosophical classic: the Trolley Problem. In the classical construction, a trolley is about to run over a few people tied to its tracks. You can save their lives only by pulling a lever, diverting the trolley onto another track where it will run over just one person instead. In the situation at hand, it’s as though a trolley is barreling toward a button that, if pushed, will realize the suffering and eventual extinction of all of humanity, and the only way for us to divert its path is throwing humanity’s most valuable creations on the tracks. To me, it’s not obvious how we should act. If we do choose to save human life, letting the trolley destroy humanity’s finest work, we corner ourselves into a conclusion not unreasonably felt incorrect. Is a desert society that can last long into the future, devoid of all that makes human culture what it presently is, more valuable than the short-term existence of all we have grown to love about our absurd, vibrant species — more valuable than our paintings, sculptures, music, food, traditions, strolls to buy coffee? My intuition tells me no. But it seems some activists would answer life and mean it. Some would say that a world without art would be justified if it meant humans would have a few more centuries on their beloved planet. And as much as I cannot seem to share this sentiment, I can’t shake my empathy for it, either. The tomato soup throwers are but another part of the culture I admire so profoundly — a culture that is often political. Rarities, they remind me of Franz Kafka’s Gregor Samsa who, after metamorphosing into a bug, finds himself condemned and on the outskirts of a society once home to him. They are another idea in humanity’s bottomless reservoir of emotional and creative capital, competing to survive, sustain itself, and make itself heard, just like the rest of the world. How could I condemn such a fundamental facet of humanity’s beautiful absurdity? I feel I cannot. To be clear, I m not advocating for or against these protests. I know that they do not, in actuality, represent a dichotomous choice between art and life, and indeed, that they did not intend to destroy the targeted artworks. And I know that preserving the world also allows us to continue the production of art. All I mean to say is: A certain beautiful irrationality makes human life what it is, and to condemn irrationality in favor of our rational, pragmatic stratagems for preserving life, effective as they may be, would be to miss something innate to humanity’s value. Especially at a university where being apolitical feels like a crime, we carefully weigh our options to ensure we act according to the values most dear to us. For some, this may include engaging in unconventional forms of protest. For others, it may mean remaining uninvolved. Whatever side we end up endorsing, we must acknowledge that hypocrisy and irrationality are inevitable, as much a staple of our species as the creativity that has allowed us to paintSunflowersandGrainstacks. Maybe at the end of it all, there’s something to value in the disagreement — as much beauty, strangely, in the discord and quagmire as in what each of us views as progress. When I take my stroll to grab a coffee, I don’t do it because it will help me in my future. I don’t do it because I won’t be able to get through lecture without caffeine. I don’t do it because it’s productive. I do it because I want to. And I am OK with the frivolity of such an act, because there’s just something about that time I wouldn’t want to live without.

crimson_2022_149,"In the midst of an add-drop period that many students are treating as the shopping week they’ll never have again, the pressure to find classes that are simultaneously interesting, requirement-fulfilling, and chill enough for students to catch a breath is intense. With Harvard offering more than3,700 coursesin 50 different undergraduate fields of study, students here should have their pick of the litter of classes that satisfy their personal trifecta of interest, requirements, and acceptable workload. There are more than enough classes for every Harvard student to logistically achieve the well-roundedliberal arts and sciences educationthat the College so prides itself on delivering to students. Yet in practice, few Harvard students pursue such a liberal arts and sciences education, even as the College encourages it with requirements and special programs. One such program is theGeneral Educationprogram, containing courses that, in the College’s words, “pose enduring questions” and “frame urgent problems.” Gen Ed courses have the greatest potential to be valuable and life-changing, investigating pressing issues that other courses may shy away from. But in truth, most students don’t treat Gen Eds like the College envisions. Students take easier courses or “gems,” like Gen Ed 1038: “Sleep” or Gen Ed 1074: “The Ancient Greek Hero,” purely to boost their GPA. There is nothing inherently wrong with taking classes for one’s GPA. Students set on graduate school, medical school, or other avenues where their grades will be scrutinized for acceptance are entirely reasonable in their inclination towards “easy A” Gen Eds. But the fact that this attitude is shared by students whose futures are GPA-agnostic suggests that this is an institutional problem: that Harvard simply lacks dedication when it comes to supporting students’ intellectual curiosity and multidisciplinary learning. For a college that tells students to “venture into new territoriesand chart your own path,” a large percentage of students here seem to be venturing only in search of an additional one or two points to their grades. Classes are the crux of a Harvard education; if they cannot instill a passion for learning in students, the entire education has failed in its mission of intellectual transformation. In order for Harvard to succeed in training the citizens and citizen-leaders of tomorrow, students and faculty must take two steps in tandem and bring academic passion back to the General Education program. First, the College should require all Gen Ed courses to use pass-fail grading. If the main objective of these classes is for students to explore perspectives from other disciplines, why put extra strain on an already stressed-out college student juggling grades, extracurriculars, and recruiting? Students can’t be expected to prioritize broadening their horizons when faced with academic incentives that reward sticking to what they know. Currently, students can only take one of their four mandatory Gen Eds pass-fail. By moving all Gen Eds to pass-fail, students are nudged to grapple with personally intriguing questions in unfamiliar disciplines — instead of just finding the easiest class to pass. Second, students must find for themselves the intrinsic value of learning. This requires significant self-reflection. As an Asian American child in a family of sticklers about grades, I empathize with students who still believe in the traditional definition of success in education as obtaining that coveted “A+” or scoring a perfect 100 percent on an exam. But you shouldn’t limit your perceptions of academic success to that number scale. College is a time to break boundaries, leave your comfort zone, and discover interests that will last a lifetime. It’s a limited four years where students all over the globe come together to innovate, obsess, and dive deeper into a multitude of unfamiliar subjects. Don’t waste your time taking a class that you know you won’t find intellectually stimulating — it only excludes you from academic fields you could’ve explored and novel ideas you could’ve learned. Some might argue that making all Gen Eds pass-fail would only reinforce students’ definition of academic success as numeric grades: If Harvard students are only grade-driven, they would put no effort into their newly pass-fail Gen Eds, learning even less than before. That’s why both the pass-fail change and the intrinsic valuation of learning must happen together. If one happens without the other, students will either end up disillusioned about subjects they are passionate but inexperienced in, or discard their sense of intellectual curiosity altogether. The two proposed actions must be taken in tandem to ensure both student happiness and growth. Attending one of the most rigorous and renowned colleges in the world is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. As students at Harvard, we shouldn’t waste this opportunity out of fear of getting a low grade. College is a time for growth and an invitation to try something completely new. So learn aboutAmerican food,acoustic engineering,East Asian cinema, or whatever else you find intellectually fascinating, and as long as you’re learning, don’t stress about a final grade. Andrew L.

stanforddaily_2022_117,"In my senior year of high school, when I chose to major in engineering after many months of wavering, I knew I had signed myself up for at least four years of intense study. Studying all night for the physics courses I didn’t care much about, but were the prerequisites to my actual engineering courses; barely passing exams and being saved by the curve over and over again; staring at assignments on new concepts when I couldn’t even understand what the question was asking—these were all scenarios I had considered and accepted. But what I had failed to realize was that I’d be met with a barrier even before this stage. In oversized, overwhelmingly male-dominated classrooms, I was scared to raise my hand, scared to make mistakes, scared to look like I had less knowledge than my male counterparts. They instead enjoyed those privileges like rights, and thus accumulated more gains from their educational experience than women. While it’s become increasingly common knowledge that female students dojust as welland sometimes better than male students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math subjects, and that enrollment in secondary education has mostly evened out among these genders, STEM equality for females generally ends here. Even with these statistics, females feel the pressure to prove themselves to males in STEM fields, and the fact thatboys think boys are smarter than girls in science classesdoesn’t help. For women who feel these microaggressions in the classroom, realizing their full potential and experiencing the same rewards as males in the same major is incredibly difficult from the start. The burden of knowing that we must prove ourselves causes us to fear making mistakes, because, as student Olivia Li at the University of Wisconsinarticulated, “people could use that as an example that women aren’t capable.” Whether the stigma is true that women in male-dominated majors are less capable than men, theundeniably large percentage of womenwho believe this myth results in unfair disadvantages from the beginning of our education. Even as someone who felt this stigma considerably less during undergrad amongst my (completely male study group who luckily were my friends as well, I still kept a low profile and was continually anxious in classes, labs and discussions away from them, causing me to now realize the learning I had missed out on. Unable to speak as freely as I was used to, I came to realize over the years that I was subconsciously choosing to sit next to female students, working with females during group projects and befriending female students in my major. I learned best through collaboration and discussion, and as I was most comfortable doing this around other women, my subconscious behavior turned conscious. Toward the end of undergrad, I had really embraced this conscious choice of partner. I had turned into the “everything’s easier this way” person. My go-to choices of study collaborators and project partners were female. I could say whatever I wanted and make whatever mistakes out of my control and know that these holes in my knowledge were not attributed to my gender. Only when I was around other females did I have zero anxieties about what I chose to wear and how I presented myself, and their implications on how well I was able to contribute and grind out the assignment of that study session. Even with TAs and professors, where the barrier of professionalism diminished some of these feelings, I still felt more comfortable with women; I would choose the lab sections and office hours held by female TAs and the classes taught by female professors. Although there is nothing wrong with preferring to work with women, the fact that this choice was driven by the pressure I felt when working with male engineering students felt wrong and unfair; frankly, the subtle lack of equal access to these resources (every single person in the room was a loud declaration that I was not learning the same things my male counterparts were, despite taking courses in the same classroom. Women consciously choosing to work with other women in this field is ashared sentiment. Even girls who have rarely felt underestimated by male classmates may stillprefer to work with other womenin class, for reasons including that other women seem to be more accepting of mistakes. Although this was a solution to the ultimately unfair discomfort I felt due to the lopsided gender ratio of my major, it wasn’t really a solution, because the number of female students in my classes was decreasing as I progressed further into the degree. Of all STEM students, women areless likely to graduate on timeor stick with the degree than men. Of all the degrees awarded to women, only 32% of these were in STEM fields. These facts, coupled with diminishing class sizes towards the end of my degree, caused my options for a study buddy to increasingly hover around the lower single digits. Although we’ve come a long way in closing thegender gap in the classroom, it’s not enough. The spillage of this problem into industry perpetuates this cycle, and while progress towards gender equality was enthusiastic at the beginning of the century, the end of the 2010s, especially with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, hasstunted the progress towards gender equality. In order to achieve gender equality in the real world, policies and changes need to be made on a vast front, from the beginning of formal education to all organization levels of home, academia, industry and society.

rice_thresher_2022_48,"ByGautam Nayer,KeShawn IvoryandShifa Abdul-Rahman3/1/22 11:07pm Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. Responding to the Rice Thresher reporter Bonnie Zhao reporting on the relocation of the WMR statue on January 25, 2022 “Rice to move Founder’s Memorial within Academic Quadrangle”: We are a group of Rice alumni, students and community activists who have been protesting since Aug. 31, 2020 due to the leadership of Shifa Rahman, a Rice student who has been continuously holding peaceful sit-ins at the statue each day at 5pm. Our sit-ins have also attracted the attention of several groups outside of Rice such as the nonprofitsPure JusticeandIndivisible Houston, Exploitation Free Zonesand outside university student groups such as Decolonization at Brown (University . Many student groups inside Rice have also been openly supportive. We have also been featured inThe Houston Chronicle, Houston PressandTexas Tribune. The toxic racial trauma we experienced as did many of our alumni and current students is manifested in our daily lives because this statue represents an era which still applies to us — the fear, insecurity, anger, frustration and sadness that while we are good enough to enter Rice and sit with the white students, we will never be fully accepted and truly belong to this campus. Having an old white enslaver lord over us from his perch only serves to harm and stymie our intellectual growth, doesn’t assist and harms Rice’s motto of “unconventional wisdom” and leads to a lack of belonging and true inclusivity. How exactly can a student or alumni of color feel accepted being on the campus, especially as a Black student walking by this statue on a daily basis? We applaud the report released by the Task Force of Slavery, Segregation and Racial Injustice to remove the statue and we are glad that our Board has agreed with the report and will be relocating the statue and have support from the Student Association. However, we are concerned about the timeline as well as other pertinent concerns regarding the relocation process. We are hopeful that our new President is willing to create a constructive and inclusive dialogue with us in person. We would like to invite our new President, Reginald Des Roches to sit with us at the statue from Monday through Friday. Sit with us, Mr. President, and let’s discuss the relocation plans together.

stanforddaily_2022_67,"Katie Eder is a sophomore majoring in American Studies and minoring in Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. On Monday at around 10:30 p.m. I was walking my dog, Llama, as I do every night. Having just spent the afternoon and evening inundated by the news alerts and social posts about the Supreme Court’s leaked decision to overturnRoe v. Wade, I felt frustration, grief and, frankly, exhaustion over the state of this country. As we walked through Meyer Green and headed toward the bookstore, I noticed a few people hunched over writing something on the ground in chalk. Having just seen the fliers for Planned Parenthood’s pro-choice poster-making event, I assumed it was people preparing for the next day. But as I got closer, it became clear that the chalkers were not writing pro-choice messages. Written all over the ground at the top of White Plaza, surrounding the “We Stand With Survivors” banner honoring National Sexual Assault Prevention Month, were messages like “Abortion is murder,” “Overturn Roe v. Wade” and “Life begins at conception.” Seeing the thick yellow and red lines of that chalk, I was struck by the reality that there are students at this school who are so excited byRoe v. Wadebeing overturned that they wanted to publicly proclaim it. I’d later learn that these students were part of Stanford College Republicans (SCR and Stanford for Pro-Life. Yet they were also my classmates and peers. And this was what they believed. I knew there was no way I could simply go to sleep. I rushed back to Stern, called anyone and everyone who’d show up, and stuffed boxes of chalk I had leftover from another event into my backpack. I gathered a few friends from the dorm and together we set out to White Plaza. Upon arriving, it was clear I was not the only one who had seen the chalk and jumped into action. There was a group of about six other people who were in a clear confrontation with Stephen Sills, the president of SCR and lead chalker. The group who had just arrived was holding a giant trash bin filled with water and dumping it on the chalk messages. One of the people in the group, Eva Jones, was being questioned by Stephen as he held up his phone in front of their faces, flash on, recording. I called out to Eva, and she came over. I let her know I had chalk, and we both agreed to stop with the water and instead cross out their messages and write our own. We felt it was important for people to see that there are students in our community who hold strong anti-choice views. But we also needed to show we weren’t going to let those statements go unacknowledged. She let the rest of her friends know and we got to chalking. For the next almost two hours, past 1 a.m., about 30 people covered White Plaza with slogans such as “My Body, My Choice,” “Roe v. WadeSaves Lives,” “Protect Women and Trans People” and my personal favorite, “If you don’t like abortions, get a vasectomy.” We blasted Eva’s “pu$$y punk” playlist through a speaker and danced, hugged, cried and chalked together. After we plastered the Plaza and were down to nubs of chalk, we called it a night. I fell asleep a little past 2 a.m. with a lot of love for the community and connection that came out of this otherwise dark day. The next morning, I headed out to walk my dog and see all the beautiful chalk in the daylight. As I approached White Plaza, my heart sank. All the chalk was gone. Every last slogan and uterus drawing from the night before, gone. It had all been washed away. I walked the perimeter in disbelief. Who washed the chalk? Was it SCR? The administration? And why? As disturbed as I was, I couldn’t let our voices be erased. I yet again beelined out of White Plaza and went to hunt down more chalk. In the midst of the chalk search, I eagerly texted people I thought might have Stephen’s number. Finally, I managed to be put in a group chat with him. I explained that I wanted to write an op-ed about the events that had transpired the night before and asked if he would be willing to meet with me that afternoon to discuss. I wanted to know if he washed the chalk off. I set a time with Stephen, acquired more chalk, and took off again for White Plaza. There was already a group of organizers from the Planned Parenthood club setting up the poster-making for their “Bans Off Our Bodies” event. I explained to them what had happened the night before and they enthusiastically supported re-chalking White Plaza. I opened up the boxes and started at the second round. As more people joined and my hands once again were covered in orange dust, that feeling of love and community came back. There were hugs and “déjà vu” jokes. And we did it a second time: we covered the ground with messages to stand up for what we know is true. “Our Bodies, Our Choice,” “Working-class and low-income people will be disproportionately impacted by the abortion bans” and “Safe Abortions Save Lives.” A few hours later, I met with Stephen. Sitting at the tables between the now chalk-covered plaza and Tresidder, we talked for 30 minutes. He told me about his life, his interests and his experience working with SCR. He explained that while he was glad we had written our viewpoints in chalk next to theirs, he had been frustrated that we had at first tried to wash away the chalk with water. He was fed up with feeling silenced by the rest of the student body and, without me even having to ask, disclosed that while he hadn’t returned later that night, he didn’t try to stop the members of the club who came back after we left, filled trash bins with water from the Claw fountain, and washed away the chalk. Hopefully by the time you read this, you can still see the second round of chalking across White Plaza, and get a clear sense that I, and many other students, wholeheartedly, and adamantly believe that people should have full control of their bodies. But that’s not the point of this piece. The point I want to make is this — no one should have washed away any of the chalk. I understand why, after seeing anti-choice chalk, the reaction a few people had was “we have to wash this away. We can’t let this be the message people see in the morning.” That was not dissimilar to my reaction. I just happened to have chalk on hand to write our own messages rather than erasing the statements that were disagreeing. As soon as the group of people who had come with the water saw that we had chalk, they realized the best way to drown out anti-choice messages was not with water, but with messages of our own. We are living in a time where polarization in this country and hatred for those with opposing political views ismore extreme than it’s been in decades. We also are living at Stanford University, a college whichdramatically limitsstudents’ ability to express political views publicly. White Plaza, designated the “free speech” zone, isthe only placeon campus we’re even allowed to do things like chalking. We, as students and future leaders, have a responsibility to do better than the adults around us. We cannot and should not silence each other. We should disagree. We should argue. We should scream our opinions from the rooftops to make sure they’re heard. But silencing others as a way to have your voice dominate is not transformative. It’s not radical. It’s cancel culture that’s preventing us from having honest discourse. This rule, like most, is never hard and fast. There are times when speech instigates violence or expresses hate. However, when the news spotlights a critical issue and our elected officials and political leaders are taking actions that we disagree with or we support, we have to be able to talk about the issues. That’s not always easy but it is necessary. College is the time to be challenged. Most of us will never be in as safe of a place to debate with each other as we are now. We must take advantage of that. Now’s the time. Figure out what you care about. Learn how to construct an argument. Develop your voice. And use it.

stanforddaily_2022_88,"Jessica Lawson is a Stanford senior majoring in human biology and minoring in creative writing. I have had approximately 2,700 meals over my four years at Stanford University. The first half of college dining was stressful. Should I have a blueberry scone or a meat lover’s omelet? Both? Wait, but there’s a waffle with the Stanford “S” — I’ll have that. The number of choices, the variety of foods and the buffet-style layout of college dining halls left me incredibly overwhelmed. As a first-year student, I took Frosh 101 to learn about campus services and career planning paths, as well as tools to hone my study techniques. But what I really needed to learn was how to eat sustainably, for my health and the health of the planet. The transition to college is a critical period in the formation of young-adult eating habits. Establishing a healthful and sustainable eating pattern is critical to personal and global survival. We live in a country wherethree-quarters of US health care spending goes to treat chronic diseases, most of which are linked to diet. We also live in a meat-centric country, consuming225 pounds per capita in 2020. It’s no secret that agriculture, especially beef and lamb,disproportionately contributeto greenhouse-gas emissions. College campuses often act as the sole source of nutrition for students. Dining programs inevitably teach, model and reinforce eating habits — but with health and environmental crises at hand, it is critical that these eating habits are sustainable. Frosh 101 courses draw students, faculty and staff together and must be utilized to teach and practice sustainable eating. Frosh 101 courses — also called student success, introduction to college, orientation to college or freshman experience courses — familiarize students with campus and the college experience, equipping them with tools and skills to flourish in college and beyond. The most recent estimates indicate thatnine out of 10 campuseshave at least one type of first-year seminar and that nearly 50% of first-year US students enroll in it. The American Association of Colleges and Universities have identified these courses as one of the10 high-impact interventionsto enhance student success. The success, popularity and relative flexibility of syllabi are a perfect method to prepare new college students to eat in a way that maximizes their health and environmental impact. According to the International Food Information Council Foundation’s2021 Food and Health Survey, 36% of baby boomers, 42% of Gen Z and 48% of millennials believed their individual food and beverage choices have a moderate or significant impact on the environment. We know the impact is direct. According toProject Drawdown, current emissions could be reduced by as much as 70% by adopting a vegan diet and 63% with a vegetarian diet. Even a slight reduction in the consumption of animal products has a meaningful impact on the environment. Adopting a plant-forward diet has significant impacts on personal health, too. A2019 studypublished inNutrition Reviewsfound that Americans are overconsuming protein, particularly animal protein. The quality of plant-based protein is higher than most realize and easily meets human protein requirements. Additionally, plant protein contains fiber. According to theHarvard School of Public Health, fiber promotes digestive health and immunity and protects against heart disease and stroke. TheMenus of Change University Research Collaborative(MCURC is leading university plant-forward dining efforts. Their2021 collaboration reportidentified healthfulness and familiarity as top factors that influence consumer food choice. Focusing on Gen-Z consumers, culture and recommendations are especially important. All four of these important elements can be addressed in a Frosh 101 classroom setting. Over75% of universitiesidentify establishing relationships between students and faculty to be among the highest-ranked objectives of Frosh 101 courses. These relationships must include university affiliated chefs, dining staff and nutritionists. Cultivating open dialogue and interactions early in the collegiate experience is likely to increase transparency surrounding the dining-hall experience as well as increase a sense of familiarity. Learning directly from a nutritionist during a lecture could dispel common myths and fears associated with college dining. Including a guest speaker related to sustainable eating would encourage students to consider the environment in their choices. I discovered nutrition and sustainable-eating courses during my junior year at Stanford — approximately 2,000 meals too late. Undoubtedly, I would have absorbed and utilized nutritional and sustainable eating advice just as I did advice on campus tutoring and using the Stanford library system. College campuses are innovation hubs, drawing students, faculty and staff together to create solutions to wicked problems. Universities must add a sustainable eating curriculum to their first-year introductory courses. Personal, population and planetary health are intertwined and will continue to be at risk until there is change. Our eating choices have direct influences on our body and earth, eliciting immediate effects, working faster than a degree in environmental science, computer science or biology. Sustainable eating, personal success and global success are inseparable; it’s time colleges recognize this. The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.

wildcat_arizona_2022_72,"Arizona’s politics are changing, but what does this mean for the 2020 Presidential Election? As the class of 2022 prepares to graduate, there is no doubt that the politics across the state and country have affected their day-to-day lives. This school year has brought many political controversies and struggles, causing difficulties for several students and employees. With a majority Democratic legislature and a Democratic president, many students, including myself, were expecting progress in the right direction for the country as a whole. However, political decisions on the state and national levels have been nothing short of lackluster. Federal Level So far the Biden administration has had an underwhelming record in accomplishing promised policy agenda items. This is not unforeseen, due to the Senate and House being very divided. However, it is disappointing since many were expecting a decent amount of progress. While running for president, Joe Biden stated he would take certain actions to move forward on policies, yet his actions have proved otherwise. Biden ran for president during the murder of George Floyd, therefore focusing a notable amount of attention on racial and equity issues. However, while in office it seems like there have not been many efforts to advance promises about racial equity. Biden has taken no significant steps on policies regarding criminal justice reform, includingendingcash bail and ridding ofmandatoryminimum sentences. TheFreedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, which would implement measures to ensure equal and fair voting rights, was also stopped by a Republican filibuster, allowing for unjust voting laws to remain in place and allowing several states to propose and pass bills that would make it incredibly difficult for many to vote. After the recent Omicron variant spike, the promise of better COVID-19 policies had also proven to fall short. The government evaded the importance of testing and masking, especially during Omicron when cases reached up to about1.2 millionin a day. The CDC did not pressure states to put in place mask mandates during the peak of Omicron and did not listen to experts that pleaded to require negative rapid tests prior to returning to work. Further, during the peak, the nation’s ability to test and trace infection wasinsufficientas at-home tests were consistently running out and not available in many places due to the Omicron variant. Several policies that the Biden administration promised to make advances in such as gun control, women’s rights, immigrant rights and worker rights have also proven to not progress. Gun control policies, such as enforcing background checks and prohibiting the production and sale of automatic and high-capacity magazines have not made a lot of progress in thelegislature. Biden’s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 wasblockedin the Senate when it was taken out of the American Rescue Plan. The political divide has also brought the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act to a halt, even though it has had bipartisan support in the political past. In regards to immigration, the Biden administration has also made use ofTitle 42, a Trump policy that allows the government to deport undocumented asylum seekers. The administration has recently used the Title 42 policy to expel 4,000 Haitians seeking asylum in Texas. And one issue that Biden has failed on, that almost all students can agree with, is the difficulties of student loans and student loan debt. While running, it seemed that Biden mentioned several times that he would take action on student loan forgiveness. According toNPR, “Biden had pledged to cancel at least $10,000 of student debt per person.” And yet this has not happened yet. Even with successes like the American Rescue Plan and the Build Back Better Act, the Biden administration has made several promises to bring unity and order in the midst of chaos. Yet it seems in the past year that chaos has remained prevalent across the U.S. State Level Arizona politics have proven to be worse than federal politics. This year, the Arizona legislature has passed bills attacking the rights to vote, women’s rights, transgender and LGBTQ+ rights, amongst other important issues. Recently, the Arizona legislature passed two anti-trans bills.SB 1138 and SB 1165were passed and signed into law by Governor Doug Ducey. SB 1138 bans medical care for transgender youth and explicitly targets anyone under 18 years old by banning several gender-affirming medical procedures. And SB 1165 prohibits transgender students from partaking in sports that align with their gender identity. The effects these bills have now that they are in law include the emotional and physical health of all transgender youth in Arizona. Along with the anti-trans bills, Ducey also signedSB 1164andHB 2492. SB 1164 restricts abortion after 15 weeks, attacking the right to reproductive freedom and affecting the health and safety of everyone with a uterus. And HB 2492 mandates Arizonans to provide documentation of citizenship while voting in federal elections, which would impact the voter registrations of thousands of people across Arizona. As constituents of Tucson and the United States, it is important that we take it upon ourselves to advocate for and fight against discrimination in all forms. When there is little happening in our federal government and when the state decides to allow discriminatory legislation to be passed, they create an environment where many don’t feel embraced.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_14,"We’ve all likely had a chance to gather our thoughts since the slap that was heard around the world. Whether or not you care about trivial celebrity culture, there are certain instances that permeate all of our newsfeeds, rendering them impossible to ignore. The recent 94th Annual Academy Awards ceremony, an event honoring the best in the film industry, was overshadowed by a brief, yet shocking onstage altercation between actor Will Smith and comedian Chris Rock following ajokethat was aimed at Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. For what it’s worth, the joke was not anything out of the ordinary for the brand of comedy often used by the hosts and presenters at Hollywood’s biggest night of the year. There is a long tradition of A-list celebrities being the butt of innocuous jokes, and it is part of their job to take them like professionals. Will Smith’s overreaction and disruptive outburst revealed his fragility and astonishing lack of self-awareness that night. However, the instant Smith’s palm struck Rock’s cheek, a pop cultural moment for the ages was solidified, accompanied by an impassioned discourse. Theensuing melodramahas forced us all to engage with, whether enthusiastically or grudgingly, a matter that seems very far removed from our own personal realities. Without missing a beat, asingle, viralimage immortalized the event, only to be memed into oblivion and burned into every last one of our brains. It has been the cheap, go-to icebreaker for casual conversation in the days following the incident, and will be referenced for years — perhaps decades — to come. When something like this happens, a line is drawn in the sand and we’re asked to choose sides. We become emotionally invested to one degree or another, and whatever side of the issue we fall on affirms our identity and the principles we hold. Then cue the media, particularly those of the Yahoo and Buzzfeed News variety, who can’t resist an opportunity to turn a salacious celebrity story into a “woke” word-saladaboutrace, gender and disability politics. Might we remind ourselves, this is the same contingent that preaches about compassion and empathy, and regularlyconflateswords as forms of violence. However, it appears they’re unbothered by any kind of physical violence, as long as it reinforces their ideological worldview. They were also very quick to shut down any sort of criticism coming from outside of the Black community,claimingit wasn’t anyone else’s place to comment. However, this was a widely publicized moment — a moment that Smith chose to make public. This increasingly common rhetoric that absolves one group from any kind of criticism by invoking race politics prevents us from having a healthy discourse. Of course there is a nuanced way to discuss these issues, but there is also right and wrong. Rightfully, most of Hollywood expressed their dismay — and even disturbance — in the aftermath of Sunday’s events. The overwhelming sentiment being that the boorish behavior was not reflective of Oscars decorum, and that it ultimately detracted fromother winners’ special moments. We should be disillusioned, not merely by Smith’s actions, but by the fact that he received a standing ovation just minutes later upon receiving the award for Best Actor and giving a nonsensical acceptance speech. It spoke to the power of in-group dynamics and how quickly the collective inertia of an audience can normalize antisocial behavior. The phrases Smith used during his speech, like wanting to be a “vessel of love” and the notion of love making a person do “crazy things” were cop-outs. There was utter incoherence between the principles he blubbered about with the actions we had all witnessed just minutes earlier. We should instead look no further than Chris Rock as a class-act and beacon of upstanding behavior in the way he conducted himself in those moments. While it may be absurd to look to the most privileged and out-of-touch members of society for teachable moments, it appears that is where we are in this celebrity monoculture. Though it might’ve felt like a complete stunt — or even a psyop, meant to stoke our most base and emotional instincts — it reminds us that there is far more dignity in self-restraint.Melissa Newell is an Opinion Staff Writer for the spring 2022 quarter.

The UBC Senate is one of the two highest governing bodies at UBC, alongside the Board of Governors. While the latter focuses on the financial matters of the university, the Senate is focused on academic governance. At UBC, the Senate is divided into the UBC Vancouver and Okanagan Senates, which come together occasionally (by occasionally, more like every 5–10 years through the Council of Senates. Within the UBC Vancouver Senate, there are 13 standing committees which focus on a variety of topics such as appeals on academic standing and academic discipline, curriculum, academic building needs and academic policy. Each student senator sits on one to three of these committees, including some representation as committee chairs and vice-chairs. The Senate meets monthly on the third Wednesday of the month at 6:00 p.m. These meetings are hybrid, and you can watch the livestream of these on the UBC Senate Facebook page or follow along on @UbysseyNews’s Twitter account. Senate Committee meetings vary depending on the committee. Most committees will meet monthly, although some may meet more or less frequently depending on the work being done. These meetings are typically closed to the public. Senate membership is divided up into various groups including ex officio members, deans and elected faculty and student senators. Of the students, there are eighteen of us — five elected at-large and the remainder elected by their respective faculties with two for graduate and postdoctoral studies, as well. The Student Senate Caucus (SSC is the elected student senator forum for discussion and consultation regarding all things Senate. We come together, usually monthly prior to Senate meetings, to share updates on what is happening in our respective committees, discuss the agenda and materials, get updates from AMS and GSS representatives and ultimately coordinate our advocacy to ensure that we can effectively advocate for students in all of our meetings. The SSC has two co-chairs, Romina Hajizadeh and Laia Shpeller, who coordinate and facilitate these meetings, sort out student senator committee placements, as well as take on additional responsibilities throughout the year when needed. This year’s SSC has a member chairing the Academic Building Needs Committee, and members vice-chairing the Academic Building Needs, Agenda, Awards and Curriculum Committees.

ubyssey_2022_5,"Sept. 27, 2022 Written byUbyssey news staff After a week of speaking to the candidates and attending the debates, we’re here to present our guide to the AMS VP finance by-election. While we aren’t going to tell you who to vote for, this article should give you a clearer picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the three candidates. Remember tovoteby 5 p.m. on September 29 — you have a chance to pick who controls the AMS’s finances. Kanji is one of two AMS staffers running for VP finance. During the debates, he repeatedly framed himself as the only candidate with specific plans — and his website backs up this claim with a detailed platform — but the feasability of proposals like asking UBC for money to bolster the AMS’s mental health coverage remains unclear. Kanji certainly has a lot of experience in the AMS as a councillor and a member of the President’s Office. His apparent closeness with executives will likely help him hit the ground running, but it could hamper his ability to enact unique change. Liu is the other AMS staffer in this race. He’s a strong advocate for raising mental health coverage beyond $1,250 — though this might not be sustainable given the AMS’s deficit — and increasing awareness around funds and financial support for students. But, he hasn’t been as concrete as Kanji in how he would implement these plans. Liu has the closest experience to the job as associate VP funds, and he’s also been the clearest of the three candidates in saying he’ll reach out to constituencies to help with the new AMS financial system. He is also cognizant of his limited time to get things done if elected. The ASC may be a joke candidate, but its human representative, Mathew Ho, seems to have some serious ideas if he’s elected VP finance. While the line between the ASC and Ho was blurred at times during the debates, the ASC wants to increase AMS transparency, expand communication and improve financial sustainability. However, like Liu, the ASC was sometimes lacking in specific solutions to these issues. Unlike past joke candidates, the ASC would in theory get things done thanks to Ho’s past experience as AUS VP finance. So, if you want a VP finance who would wear a trash can on their head, vote for the ASC. Share this articlecopied!

stanforddaily_2022_30,"If you were given an option to choose between working a 9-5 desk job or inheriting 13 million followers on TikTok and becoming an influencer, which would you choose? Chances are, you’d choose the influencer job — at least I would. Mikayla Nogueira (@mikaylanogueira is one of the biggest TikTok beauty influencers, amassing over 13.6 million followers on TikTok and 2.4 million followers on Instagram. Recently, she received backlash aftera now-deleted video she posted a year and a half ago resurfaced, in which she states, “I literally just finished work and it’s 5:19. Try being an influencer for a day.” Upon first seeing this clip, I was immediately taken aback by hearing such a privileged comment. Ending work at 5:19 p.m. is not something completely outrageous, especially considering the job. People are obviously allowed to complain about their jobs and be tired. However, in the context of the work of an influencer in comparison to a more “common” job, Mikayla’s comment appeared very out of touch. After delving deeper into the video, I learned that there is more than the20-second clip that was going viral. In the full video, she begins, “Every single day, I get up at 6 A.M. I spend about 5-6 hours filming video content that ranges from 3-4 videos, and I spend a few hours editing that video content.” She then continues by saying she is in meetings from 12-5 and states that people who claim influencing is easy are out of their minds: “It is not for everybody, in fact, it’s for a very small handful of people who can actually do this job… You do not want to have this job, I’m just saying.” Now, I’m by no means an influencer expert, but I can think of a few (a lot of jobs that are more strenuous than being an influencer. Despite Mikayla’s tedious outline of her day, the position of an influencer is not as structured or physically exhausting as the job of a doctor, teacher, construction worker or Starbucks barista, who often might work more than 8 hours a day. Sometimes, these additional hours might also be unpaid. Sure, a day may be full of content creation and editing, but you can take a break whenever you want for however long you want, and the next day could be spent attending a company party or flying for an all-expenses vacation paid for by a brand the influencer is working with. The non-influencer professions often don’t have the liberty of controlling their schedules, don’t experience the same luxuries and don’t receive the same amount of income as these mega-influencers. As a university student, the influencer appeal is very intriguing. The influencer job is glamorous, and although one may not truly understand the struggles it comes with, it seems to be a dream job. The idea of posting 60-second clips about a passion of yours, getting brand deals, enjoying overall freedom and getting paid thousands of dollars would intrigue anyone that is on their seventh reading and fifth p-set assignment of the week. This is likely even appealing to the 34-year-old sitting at their 9-5 desk job. It is the idea that one can post fun, short videos about anything they want and get rewarded with more money for that one video than an average person makes in a month. Mikayla then responded to the backlash and acknowledged her flawed choice ina video posted to her TikTok account,which currently has over 1.7 million likes. She started the video by asking someone off-camera, “Is it 5:19 yet? Well, that’s my cut-off time. I can’t be making this video if it’s 5:19.” Perhaps a distasteful start, Mikayla’s opening rephrases the same notorious comment that went viral. I understand trying to make light of an unfortunate situation, but making a repeated joke about something that people already found unpleasant might not have been appropriate. In this lengthy TikTok video, Mikayla admits she regrets making the video and claims she has grown since then. She explains it was filmed on a bad day when she was new to influencing and had just quit her retail job at Ulta Beauty. Mikayla says the job is taxing on her, but she loves it and it comes with many blessings. This situation highlighted the dramatic disparities between an influencer job and a 9-5 job. Whether it is a difference in income or flexibility, the work of an influencer is often less strenuous and usually more enjoyable. Influencing can definitely take a toll on people’s mental health, and we shouldn’t invalidate those experiences. However, it is also imperative to not turn a blind eye to the freedom and privilege the influencer job possesses.

wildcat_arizona_2022_25,"A student checks Twitter on their phone on Nov. 17 at the University of Arizona. Elon Musk has officially bought and taken ownership of the popular social media outlet Twitter. This comes months after Musk first contacted the former CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, to express his interest in the futuredirectionof social media. From the time he contacted Dorsey to the time of his acquisition of Twitter, Musk attempted to get out of the deal andpostponeit multiple times. The main reason Musk decided to buy Twitter was because of his concern for embracing free speech and “helping humanity.” This in itself is an unrealistic claim, and Musk seems to be doing this simply because of his arrogance and because he can, not because he wants to help humanity, whatever that may mean to him. Musk clearly does not understand or does not care about the harm that can arise from mass disinformation. It seems that Musk believes allowing disinformation to reign without censorship is allowing free speech to flourish. One of Elon Musk’s original plans for Twitter was tounbanformer President Donald Trump (which has sincehappened . According to the Supreme Court case Brandenburg v. Ohio,free speech does not allow therightto incite imminent lawless action, especially like that of theeventson Jan. 6, 2021. Trump also repeatedly denied the election results with no factual backing on his Twitter account on that day. Heclaimedthat the states wanted a redo on their votes because they “voted on a fraud.” Allowing speech like this on Twitter only brings more harm than good. Furthermore, Musk seems to be contradicting himself when it comes to disinformation and dishonesty. On Nov. 7, Musk tweeted remarks about parody accounts, stating that if the account owners did notdisclosethat it was a parody account, they would be banned. This decision from Musk came after users changed their usernames to his own name and began mocking the billionaire. So, do parody accounts count as dishonesty and disinformation, especially if they are making claims about who they are pretending to be, and is stopping disinformation important? Or does it only matter if it is personally affecting Elon Musk? If these accounts are worthy of being suspended from the platform, so are others who spew false information and incite violence. Musk also suggestedchargingverified accounts an $8 monthly subscription to have their blue checkmarks next to their names. If parody accounts are so harmful to the platform, Musk should want users verified easily and for free. These actions of trying to monetize Twitter and banning parody accounts are excellent displays of Musk’s contradicting behavior regarding disinformation and free speech. RELATED:OPINION: BeReal is a masterclass in performed authenticity To make matters worse, Musk himself does not seem to know where to get reliable information from. OnOct. 30, while being owner of the company, Musk tweeted a link to a news article regarding Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, the victim of arecentattack. The news article Musk was referring to was from asitethat claims to be a news site but only spews baseless conspiracy theories. Though he deleted the tweet, it is concerning that the man who is claiming to care about free speech and letting the truth thrive uses his influence to spread false information. The even bigger concern regarding this Twitter takeover is how much more influential and powerful Elon Musk will become. Thewealthiestman alive gaining control over a large social media outlet begs the question of how much more power he and other billionaires may attempt to grab moving forward. How much influence will he gain in politics since Twitter is a largely political platform? While I can hope he will use his newfound platform for good, there is reason to suspect that his new position may further political corruption and steer the United States closer to a plutocracy, making average citizens’ problems even more out of touch with the politicians and people in power who represent them.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_43,"Provost Hal Stern released astatementon Jan. 21 confirming the continuation ofplansto begin in-person instruction on Jan. 31. UCI had already experienced multiple two-week extensions of online learning since the original announcement. UCI’s communication with the student body, student government and faculty on the transition back to campus has allegedly been lacking with the decision based scientific data unclear, and the approach to returning to campus being non-inclusive, inconsistent and indecisive. On that same day, shortly after Provost Stern’s statement, Associated Graduate Students (AGS and Associated Students (ASUCI released ajoint statementin response to Stern. Stern suggested that the decision was based on “broad consultation with the community, including discussions with Academic Senate leadership, student government leadership, campus health leadership and university administrators.” However, AGS and ASUCI claim that they were never consulted. In an interview with the New University, AGS President Connor Strobelexpressedthe student government’s deep frustration with this false claim. The New University also spoke with AGS’s VP of Finance and sociology Ph.D. candidate Canton Winer. “The university’s communication throughout the pandemic has been unclear to say the least. That’s been a theme in their communications throughout the pandemic, and that’s a shared opinion of many on AGS and of many of our constituents who have told us that they’re frustrated by the lack of transparency and detail in the University’s communications,” Winer said. Winer emphasized that AGS had “urged the university repeatedly to consult student government leadership,” yet claims they were never consulted. Consultation and clear communication with members of our community is imperative, especially on an issue that involves student’s safety and health. In addition to allegedly failing to consult members of the community, UCI’s statement on returning to campus lacks a clear scientific basis. Sternclaimedthat the decision was based on “a recent decline in the Omicron surge, in both case counts and positivity rate,” and ultimately, “COVID-19 models predict that this will continue.” It’s also never specified what “models” Stern is referencing. In contrast, Chancellor Howard Gillman’sstatementon Jan 6. explained that UCI was remaining online due to both high case numbers at UCI and in Orange County as well as a shortage in staffing and faculty. However, Stern never addressed what specifically changed about these factors that now make it safe to return to campus. Without UCI’s scientific basis, the university’s approach only adds to the confusion of the diverse COVID-19 health protocols from other institutions, organizations and services. These inconsistencies among institution COVID-19 policies deepen public confusion in what kind of activities and behaviors that are considered socially safe, which is key to the success of navigating through the pandemic. With mixed messages being sent about what’s considered “safe” behavior, the public becomes indecisive and is left to make ill-advised decisions on mask wearing, indoor and outdoor gatherings and opening of businesses and services. For UCI to withhold their scientific evidence, this confusion on “safe” behavior during the pandemic is only heightened. Additionally, Winer and AGS also expressed concerns with the lack of clear communication on how the university will accommodate people who are disabled or immunocompromised. Winer has heard from multiple members of the community about their experiences reaching out for accommodations at UCI’s Disability Services Center. “Some of them have been told yes, and they got accommodations, and that’s fantastic. However, some of them were declined because they did not have a documented disability or for whatever reason, they didn’t meet the criteria,” Winer said. Winer also shared that there has been no clarification on accommodations for students living with or caring for someone who is disabled, immunocompromised or vulnerable to COVID-19. He argued that the absence of explicit recognition of disabled and immunocompromised people goes against UCI’s claim to be guided by amissionof inclusive excellence. UCI’s policies have also lacked consistency and decisiveness. In addition to the lack of clarity about why and how we are safely transitioning to in-person instruction, UCI has been late in informing the student body about what model of learning UCI will implement, which has harmful and disruptive consequences to the learning of students. Whether or not UCI decides to go fully in-person, entirely remote or settle for ahyflexmodel, it’s important that UCI commits to a plan and communicates that clearly. A consistent learning environment will allow students to settle into classes and figure out their study habits without the pressure of having to suddenly adapt. Despite the decision to open in-person learning on Jan. 31, professors are still scrambling to make choices of their own to take this approach or remain in the remote learning mode, deepening the hardship on students and the teaching staff. Winer supported the hyflex model, which will give “students the choice to continue learning online if that’s what’s safest for them.” He also shared that the AGS Board have heard from many international students who are currently abroad that it wouldn’t be conceivable for their return for the reopening. Winer shared that there were three main actions that AGS believed needed immediate action by the university. The first was for Stern to publicly apologize for his false statement about consulting student government. The second was for the university to actually cooperate with the student government on this issue. The final was to create a model of universal accommodation. When navigating a situation that involves the health and learning of so many people, UCI needs to consult with community members and communicate more timely and explicitly the measures in which they are taking to ensure all students are accommodated. It’s also just as imperative for them to share what scientific basis they are making these decisions. The largely uncertain and vague communication by the administration on UCI’s return to campus plan has been ultimately disruptive to the learning of students who are forced to remain flexible to dramatic readjustments in their study habits, class structure, living situations and schedules; it has also been harmful to teaching, as professors have had to redesign in-person class plans to fit the online format at the last minute. Hopefully UCI can begin to take these issues into account as the university continues to navigate this pandemic. Erika Cao is an Opinion Staff Writer. She can be reached atcaoea@uci.edu."
crimson_2022_108,"It was a sunny and pleasant afternoon on March 21st several years ago. As the warmer temperature began to melt the snow, it felt like spring had arrived. While walking on a street near Boston’s famous Fenway Park, I noticed a beautiful scene where the steam was whirling and rising from the ground to the sky like a whirling Dervish. Recalling that it was Nowruz day, I scribbled a poem instantaneously. One month ago, members of the Uyghur community in the Greater Boston area participated in the Nowruz Festival organized by the Central Asian Student Association at Harvard University. Sitting as one of the participants in the festival, listening to the congratulatory remarks of University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken ’84 broadcasted via video, I felt warm feelings among participants, be they from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, or Uzbekistan. Like everyone else, I felt joyful seeing every group’s festival performance, which included singing, dancing, and a fashion show. And on behalf of the Uyghur community, I, too, presented to the audience my poem written on Nowruz day near Fenway Park several years ago. While watching festivities, I thought to myself — would it not be the absolute joy of Nowruz if the dark day ends and warm spring-like freedom embraces Uyghurs immediately? Nowruz is the day of the spring equinox. The celebration of Nowruz is one of our traditional holidays and has a long history among Uyghurs. I have been celebrating it since I was a kid; I particularly enjoyedthe wrestling matchesback then. The social atmosphere of the Nowruz festival is inclusive, immersed in unity and equality; people young and old participate in the holiday. Some tell epic stories, others read poems, some dance, and others wrestle. It is celebratory; people dress up with their new clothes and wish each other good luck — and they all share an exceptional food called “Nowruz Eshi.” Nowruz day is philanthropic and inspirational. Able members of the community help the poor, sick, weak, and vulnerable, while the learned men encourage others to pursue knowledge, choose righteousness over wickedness, and protect and preserve the unity of the community. Through those events, they turn Nowruz day into a day of joy which warms the hearts of everyone with friendship, compassion, love, unity, and hope. For Uyghur people, celebrating Nowruz is not simply showing respect to the law of nature where the harsh winter ends and warm spring starts. It is also their longing for ending brutal and oppressive days and the beginning of peaceful times. Uyghur immigrants celebrate Nowruz in any American state with a sizable Uyghur community, and Massachusetts is surely one of them, as around 200 Uyghurs reside in the Greater Boston Area. Until 2017, celebrating Nowruz might have been considered the continuation of a tradition from the so-called Uyghur “Autonomous” Region — as Uyghurs living there are not afforded much autonomy at all. But since 2017 — when the Chinese government began buildinginternment campsto detain at least a million Uyghurs with baseless charges and cruel and extreme measures — celebrating Nowruz for Uyghurs abroad has been seen as one of the symbols in the fight against the Chinese government’s destruction of Uyghur identity. Five years have passed since then. Although several world governments — such asthe U.S.,the U.K., and most recently,France— have declared China’s abuse of Uyghurs an ethnic genocide,China is not backtracking. Over a million Uyghur intellectuals, professionals, religious leaders, and ordinary people have yet to be released from the camps, many have died, and many more are still missing.Uyghur children are still sufferingand their parents are taken from their homes against their will andforced to workin harsh conditions. China’s policy directed toward Uyghur people is the mixture of the worst form of capitalism — exploitation, the worst form of communism — state terror, and the worst form of ultra-nationalism — forceful assimilation. Its ultimate goal is to erase everything Uyghur. Although a crime of this magnitude committed in the name of the Chinese state should have shaken the conscience of the world, more countries have publicly stood with China than against it. Realizing that facing existential threat, Uyghurs are clinging to every bit of chance that gives them hope for a better tomorrow and Uyghurs across the diaspora are trying to pick joy among sadness, choose hope over hopelessness, and display our determination to keep our identity whenever there is even an iota of possibility to do so. And participating in the Nowruz Festivals like this one held at Harvard not only lifts our spirits but also gives us an opportunity to display our strong will to preserve our culture. When there is a continuity of our traditional culture, there will be a future for Uyghurs and the real Nowruz — the warm spring-like freedom — will embrace the Uyghur people at last.

thetech_mit_2022_28,"Dear President Reif, Chancellor Nobles, and Provost Barnhart, We write as more than 2000 MIT students, alumni, faculty, staff, affiliates, community members, and neighbors who strongly disagree with the recentdecisionto maintain a closed campus at MIT going forward. While reasonable precautions were necessary during the pandemic before full vaccinations were available, closing MIT’s campus will diminish the openness which makes MIT the vibrant, collaborative, forward-thinking place that it is. This letter calls for a return to the century-old openness policy as it was before 2020. As President Reif said in the 2016 preface to the MIT campus guide: “Because openness is a central MIT value, our campus is open too. The vast majority of our buildings are open to the public and the campus has no visible perimeter; we are an aggressively ungated community that works around the clock and welcomes the world in.” MIT students and community members have used this openness in many ways. It can be to collaborate or socialize at MIT with the broader community, share lectures with high school students eager to learn, and hold meetings or meet for coffee with visiting scholars, tech and life science entrepreneurs and other visitors to campus. We are all lifelong students, and the Infinite Corridor and other MIT spaces lose much of their value if impressionable students of all ages and curious minds from all backgrounds can no longer share space. Much of what makes MIT special is that we interact with the community rather than turning our back and closing itself off. For alumni, we can no longer return to the hallowed halls where we learned to be the scientists, engineers, politicians, doctors, teachers, and innovators we’ve become and stay connected to the MIT community. Many of those of us who are graduates have naturally drifted away from campus to pursue jobs and careers with the skills and knowledge we gained in our time at MIT. But many of us feel the call back to the place we spent our young adulthood and return — to show our families, friends, business connections, and children the place where we got started. Making campus a place to which we can no longer return weakens our ability to be ambassadors to the future community of MIT and continue the legacy that has already been built. In recent years, MIT has undertaken the Better World Campaign to strengthen its position as a leader in tackling humanity’s urgent challenges. We’ve also implemented diversity, equity and inclusion policies which seek to create a more welcoming campus, while at the same time erecting gates and obstacles to those who wish to join us. We cannot create a better, more inclusive world on a global scale while shutting it out locally. How many MIT startups were inspired, not by looking around campus, but by engaging those beyond campus to find important problems to solve? How many key research insights came about from chatting after a lecture with a member of the community? An open MIT is imperative to a vibrant MIT, as it has been for more than a century. A limited set of open buildings do not keep the current campus from being closed radically more than at any time in its history. This major policy change to close off the campus was made with little community process or input. If this is a change MIT wishes to make, it should take place only after a full community process involving current students, alumni and community members. Rather than making these changes now, MIT s administration must take the time to interface with us and learn about our concerns, and what we will lose with a closed campus. We believe that we will find that the positives of an open campus dramatically outweigh the negatives, andask that you rescind this policy and retain a fully open MIT until this process can take place. Thank you, 1255 MIT alumni447 current MIT undergraduates265 current MIT graduate students155 current faculty and staff225 other affiliates and community members If you wish to sign onto this letter, you can do so attinyurl.com/keepmitopen."
stanforddaily_2022_26,"“Well, at least it’s not two today,” I thought as I dodged a parked Marguerite Shuttle completely blocking the bike lane at the corner of Via Ortega and Campus Drive. The shuttle, which often comes in pairs, has been a dangerous feature of this part of my commute every day this week. These buses are just another object in my growing tally of golf carts, construction vehicles, fallen branches, landscapers’ carts, moving dollies, and double-parked cars that are a daily hazard for Stanford’s cyclists. Cycling, among the most utilized transportation options by Stanford students, is significantly more dangerous than most people realize. Arecord1,260 cyclists were killed in the United States in 2020, mostly in motor vehicle accidents. Stanford’s idyllic campus is sadly not immune to the dangers of biking around cars.In 2010, visiting Chinese doctoral student, Yichao Wang, was killed after his bike was hit by a Honda Civic at the corner of Palm Drive and Museum Way. Too little has changed since then, and there are still far too many places on campus where non-existent or blocked bike lanes and speeding cars could combine to tragic results. Suddenly leaving a blocked bike lane to detour around a parked vehicle is how many of these accidents happen.Protected bike lanes, thegold standardin cyclist safety, should be a long-term goal for Stanford’s administrators. However, the first step in making campus safer for cyclists is to get vehicles to stop blocking bike lanes—especially those with Stanford plates.

rice_thresher_2022_5,"ByThresher Editorial Board11/8/22 11:37pm If you had stumbled into the Baker Institute on Nov. 7 expecting a showdown between the Rice Democrats and Rice Republicans, you would’ve been sorely disappointed. The debate, a tradition which has not occurred since 2018,was canceled. We are not missing much, though: the debate would have just regurgitated generic and predetermined political party talking points. If we want campus discussions on politics to have an impact beyond elections, we should invite all voices to the table and talk policy on a comprehensive level. With the hot-button topics originally planned for the debate — the Russia-Ukraine War, healthcare and gun control — the possibility of voters’ opinions being swayed by the debate right before Election Day was slim. Ultimately, a more productive conversation would focus on long-term policy outcomes and not just electoral victory, which is especially useless with a student population that votes majority Democratic. More importantly, the debate should bring in other political organizations on campus such as Torch — Rice’s Libertarian student organization — and Rice Left to debate the merits of various policy positions on all dimensions of the political spectrum. While it’s true that elections typically end up being between Democrats and Republicans, this is a product of our electoral system, which can be debated in and of itself. But within the two parties on the ticket, there is room to push each more towards the extremes or to the center by focusing on specific policies. These discussions should continue year-round to motivate students to talk to their representatives, participate in primaries and get more involved in politics. The shallow “debate” that was planned is an affront to what the university stands for. Rice is dedicated to research, conversation and the pursuit of knowledge, not to recycled talking points. We cannot make advancements in public policy if our sole purpose is scoring sound bites. The debate should not simply be an opportunity for self-affirmation. Instead, the goal of political organizations on this campus should be to mobilize students to dedicate their time to advocating for the best policies for the people of Harris County, Texas and the United States.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_55,"The University of California is one of the most prestigious public research university systems in the world, with the nine UC campuses home to state-of-the-art laboratories, museums and medical centers. While the UC system advertises its faculty as the“drivers behind innovations,”their lectures have been treated as far less for years. During the nearlythree-yearlong contract negotiations, lecturers at the University of California have been faced with little to nojob security, unfair wages and unmanageable workloads. Lecturers are often assigned to teach very large courses, many of which are not provided with ample teaching assistants. This causes lecturers and teaching assistants to be frequentlyundercompensatedfor much of their work. While the negotiations shed light on the disparities that lecturers have faced, many current and former faculty have faced struggles with job security since the lastUC strike in 2002. The university has treated lecturers as disposable faculty while simultaneously advertising them as the most valuable instructors. UC lecturers had been negotiating for job security, a manageable workload and fair compensation since April 2019. It took over two years for the lecturer’s union,UC-AFT,to reach a tentative agreement with the UC system. The agreement came in mid-November, just hours before UC lecturers were planning tostrike. While the tentative agreement is a significant victory for lecturers and students alike, the UC’s long history of exploiting lecturers remains. The most significant difference betweenlecturers and professors, aside from salary, is that professors conduct research while lecturers do not. The omission of research, however, doesn’t mean that lecturers work any less. Lecturers in the UC system teachmore than 30%of all for-credit classes at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. The different tiers of teaching faculty in the UC system can oftentimes be confusing, leading to misinformation around the treatment of different groups. Many people often don’t fully understand or are aware of the tier system that UC faculty are subject to. Thelack of awarenessof these systems and disparities have made it much easier for UC to get away with treating their lecturers so poorly. For many lecturers, the work comes inshort-termand often part-time contracts. The contracts that many lecturers were tied to provided no job security and led to over 25% of lecturers not returning the following year. Unlike many other large university systems, the UC required lecturers to be employed for18 quarters or 12 semestersconsecutively to achieve continuing lecturer status. It took most lecturers at least six years to feel that their position was protected. UC Irvine anthropology and global studies continuing lecturer Thomas Douglas has taught within multiple university systems and compared his job security at each institution. Early in Douglas’s career, he worked at California State University and Long Beach while also lecturing at UC Irvine. Lectures in the UC system are often not notified whether they will be brought back or let go until the last minute. “You always have to make sure you are lining something up in case you don’t get invited back,” Douglas said. Douglas also compared the ways in which faculty are provided with job security at CSU Long Beach. After about a year of employment when Douglas proved that his teaching was effective, he was very confident that CSU Long Beach would continue to provide him with teaching opportunities. However, for Douglas and many other UC lecturers, the process is “not the same at all.” According to Douglas, the period in which there is little to no job security at CSULB lasts about a year. This is drastically different from the UC system’s previous six-year policy. The six-year period can be extremely difficult — even for those who do get invited back each term. Lecturers are forced to endure high costs of living while relying on part-time pay for an extended period of time. Moreover, the exhausting anxiety of not being welcomed back each term lasts for six or more drawn out years. Diane Nevárez, a former UC Irvine lecturer of race and diversity, recently wrote an op-ed published in theLA Timeswhich recounts her experience as a churned lecturer. Nevárez, who holds a Ph.D. in urban education policy from the University of Southern California, was forced to move on from her position at UC Irvine because she could not afford to live near campus. In the article, she described her work as being largely unpaid. “My part-time salary came with a full-time workload,” Nevárez said. In addition to poor pay and no job security, UC lecturers were also subject to difficulty in obtaininghealth benefits.Lecturers were required to teach in three consecutive quarters or two consecutive semesters to have access to the university’s health benefits. However, Douglas described that instead of teaching one or two courses a term, many lecturers would be assigned to teach multiple courses one term and then not be assigned any for the next term. This manipulation of scheduling, whether intentional or not, made it so lecturers would miss out on important health benefits. The average yearly salary for a UC lecturer is less than$20,000 a year,forcing over 25% of lecturers to be eligible for government assistance. In a university system that loves to advertise its top-notch learning environment, the well-being of the teaching faculty should be a top priority. A university cannot effectively function to the highest ability if its employees are overworked and struggling to pay rent. These are the exact conditions that UC lecturers have been faced with for multiple years. Moreover, if a university is going to charge its students tens of thousands of dollars each year, they should be met with faculty who can support them throughout their academic careers. For many students, the churning of lecturers means losing valuable mentors who can provide them with career and academic support and write them recommendation letters. Students who work to create lasting relationships with their high-quality instructors often lose them as a resource with little or no warning or explanation. The newtentative agreementreached by the UC lecturers union will provide more job security, increased salaries, moderated workloads and four weeks of paid family leave for all lecturers. While this tentative contract agreement will make an immense difference for all lecturers, the university’s previous treatment of its lecturers should not be easily forgotten. For many lecturers, this agreement has come too late. Students and all campus community members must realize the unfair hierarchy that is present for all faculty within the UC system. While tenure track professors often conducted groundbreaking research, equal praise and value must be placed on those teaching the next generation of researchers.Claire Schad is an Opinion Staff Writer.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_6,"Multitalented 18-year-old celebrity JoJo Siwa was nominated for an award at the 2022 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Award butdid not attend. On April 9, Siwa revealed through TikTok that she didnot receive a ticketto the show. While she expressed uncertainty regarding Nickelodeon’s decision, fansspeculatedthat Siwa was barred from taking part in the ceremony because she strayed from her former “family-friendly” image by coming out aspansexualand chopping off her signature ponytail in favor of a pixie cut. Many have called Nickelodeon’s decision “homophobic,” and Siwa — whoresharedsuch posts — seems to agree with the accusations. Nickelodeon claims that Siwa was not invited because of“because of a much reduced audience size due to COVID protocols”. However, I suspect that they are ingratiating themselves with conservative viewers because Siwa would be difficult to overlook, with over 11 million followers on Instagram. Nickelodeon garnered controversy in 2021 when it refused toallow Siwa to perform new music. In doing so, Nickelodeon has not only chosen ratings over queer visibility, but sent out the message that children are not allowed to grow and explore themselves. The Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards (KCAs airs on a Saturday night in late March or early April. Viewers can vote for their favorite musician, actor and athlete through the official Nickelodeon website or via text. Siwa’s involvement with Nickelodeon dates back to2017, which is another reason why her exclusion from the awards show has enraged fans. On the channel, she has appeared in programs such as “Blurt!” and “Lip Sync Battle Shorties.” Siwa also appeared as a playable character in the 2020 video game “Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix.” Nickelodeon is choosing to underscore Siwa’s significance to its brand and her impact on its viewers. If an outsider decided to include Siwa in a game about Nickelodeon, then she is clearly a vital part of the channel. Yet, despite being a key component of the network and being nominated for an award, Nickelodeon decided not to invite Siwa to the 2022 Kids’ Choice Awards. When one compares Siwa with her former self a couple of years ago, one might notice two primary changes: she came out as a member of the LGBTQ+ community before dating her best friend for several months and she cut her signature long hair, sharing a picture of the newhairdoon Instagram on April 7. It is clear that her absence from the ceremony is not because of a sudden decline in talent, but Nickelodeon’s homophobia and obsession with youth. This is not the first time that the children’s channel has censored the portrayal of LGBTQ+ media. Co-creator of the animated series “The Legend of Korra” Bryan Konietzkoconfessedthat he received pushback from Nickelodeon when he suggested depicting an unambiguous, full-fledged romance between main characters Korra and Asami in the series’ final episode. While the network claimed to be supportive, theystatedthat they had “a limit to how far” they could go with a queer love story. It seems that Nickelodeon’s “support” was merely abstract, imaginary and hypothetical — grounded in zero interest in actually using their platform to positively influence LGBTQ+ kids, who would feel seen and heard if they saw their experiences reflected on the screen. However, what is puzzling is that in later years, Nickelodeon has given the green light to airing LGBTQ+ representation on their network. “Rocko’s Modern Life: Static Cling,” the 2019 sequel to the 1993 series “Rocko’s Modern Life,” features a transgender character and in 2020 the show “Danger Force” portrayed a child with two fathers. Did the network take a major step backwards by excluding Siwa from attending the ceremony? A sudden outburst of homophobia after an improving track record sounds unlikely. There has to be something else at play here. The same channel that alluded to Spongebob beinggaywould not exclude one of their most popular actresses on the basis of sexuality alone. I still remember the uproar that Miley Cyrus’s “Wrecking Ball” music video caused. People all over the media wondered how the doe-eyed child actress who played Hannah Montana could turn into a woman so unabashed about her sexuality, so much so that Cyrus gave a public response declaring Hannah Montana“dead.”Parents were especiallyguiltyof this, expressing fear that Cyrus would corrupt their daughters. Side-by-side photos of the singer in her teens and at present were widelycirculated— often with the intent of criticizing Cyrus’s life choices. The public response that Siwa received after coming out is heavily reminiscent of that period. Parents sharedcommentsclaiming that they will boycott all TV shows that Siwa appears in; others claimed that Siwa wouldcorrupt childrenwho are too young to learn about gay people. Both Cyrus and Siwa underwent two major similarities that prompted such a strong reaction: they both cut their hair and explored their sexuality. As a society, we seem to give ourselves the luxury of growth, while restricting former child-actors to a state of statis, a sentiment confirmed by “Matilda” actressMara Wilsonherself. We expect young adults — Cyrus was 20 at the time of her controversy and Siwa is 18 — to continue satisfying the desires of children and adolescents, even after they have clearly outgrown these roles. This obsession with perpetual youth can also manifest in harmless ways. For example, I have come across several people who admit that they cannot seeDaniel Radcliffeas anyone but Harry Potter. However, when it crosses dangerous territories like criticizing someone’s autonomy, self-development and self-exploration, it becomes creepy because that signifies that we believe actors owe us a false presentation of themselves. Nickelodeon may support Siwa privately and may have no moral problem with queerness. However, by pandering to viewers who are either homophobic or expect adult actresses to maintain an image that was established when they were minors, Nickelodeon is being actively homophobic. It is easier to broadcast fictional queer characters because those characters are controlled to the viewers’ liking. Not only is the channel teaching its child audience that there is something immoral about same-sex love, it is sending a message that growing up on one’s own terms is looked down upon. If the network really wants to show support for the LGBTQ+ community, they should support an actual queer human being who has done so much for their channel. Otherwise, their supportcomes across as hypothetical and conditional. Right now, their message seems to be “I accept you if you are gay, but please be gay in a PG way that does not disturb viewers.” Mariam Jawhar is an Opinion Intern for the spring 2022 quarter.

wildcat_arizona_2022_33,"An image of a BeReal user taking a photo in her bathroom mirror. Image by Mary Ann Vagnerova. You may have read aprevious opinion piece, published in theDaily Wildcatat the end of May, which applauded BeReal for being a “refreshing take on social media” that “takes out the toxicity.” I would like to present an opinion which counters this perspective: BeReal is simply an equally toxic spin-off. First, a brief reminder of how BeReal works. TheBeReal websiteexplains the app’s usage succinctly: “Every day at a different time, everyone is notified simultaneously to capture and share a Photo in 2 Minutes.” The resulting photo is then posted to your account, which can be public or private. All previous posts are stored in your private “Memories.” By 2022, BeReal had been installed more than28 million timesand boasted over 21 million active monthly users. Suffice to say, the app is pretty popular — but I’ve personally only ever seen it used by Gen Z. How did BeReal get such a chokehold on Gen Z? One possible answer is the BeReal college student ambassador program. According to anarticlepublished in Brown University’s student newspaper, an ambassador of the company recruited one of the university’s students back in June 2021: “The ambassador encouraged the student to promote BeReal at Brown University through monetary incentives: For every person she referred to the app, she would receive $30. Every person who downloaded the app and sent a review to the student would in turn receive $50.” BeReal continues to recruit college students for its brand ambassador program, the responsibilities and perks of which are outlined on adedicated pageof their website. Of course, recruiting college students as brand ambassadors is a common practice for a whole host of companies. University of Arizona students are ambassadors forDuffl, forKaplan— and now even for BeReal (I can’t be the only one who noticed BeReal tabling on the UA Mall at the start of the semester . I don’t see anything fundamentally wrong with hiring ambassadors to advertise for a company; folks need to get the word out about their products somehow! However, in the case of BeReal, an app which seems to target the more thoughtful portion of society in an effort to build a positive community of users, it is a bit off-putting to know that the first group of BeReal users was a random subset of students who probably just wanted or needed some quick cash. I doubt that these methods are likely to foster the kind of uplifting, non-toxic, authentic community that the company claims to strive for. BeReal’s motives are called into further question by their counterintuitive and contradictory (perhaps even oxymoronic! marketing on TikTok. Why would an app which lauds itself for creating a less toxic form of social media decide to advertise itself using a supposedly more toxic form of social media? Allow me to provide some further background information: TheBeReal iOS App Store pageclaims that “BeReal won’t make you famous,” implying that posts on the app will not go viral — and thus trends can’t develop. My BeReal “Discovery” page, for instance, appears to be filled with random posts that nobody has interacted with at all. Trends are clearly still part of BeReal’s marketing strategy though, and the company has turned to other social media platforms to advertise — and ultimately also to start and participate in trends (such as one involvingthrowing your phoneinto the air while taking your BeReal photo, and one surrounding people who got their BeReal notification at aninopportune moment . As a result, a strangely symbiotic relationship between the so-called toxic social media and BeReal’s new and improved type of social media has emerged. Without TikTok and Instagram, BeReal may not have reached as large of an audience. Conversely, BeReal has allowed for new trends to form on other social media platforms, and the app now effectively acts as a stamp of approval and guarantor of authenticity. RELATED:OPINION: BeReal is the new social media platform I’ve been waiting for — here’s why Personally, I learned about BeReal through TikTok in February. I did not download the app immediately, primarily because I felt I did not need another form of social media to waste time on. On Sept. 15, I finally gave in to the trend. I thought that perhaps I had been too pretentious with all my philosophical pondering about authenticity and that I should just give the app a try. A friend of mine had also recently downloaded BeReal and told me how much she liked it, so I had a positive review and at least one follower. Thus began my journey of becoming my mostrealself. It was a bumpy road at first. Since there was no way that I was going to allow my BeReal notification to make a tone (I had concerns about being alerted in class or in a meeting , I would often end up posting late, which frustrated me. The photosystem confused me a bit at first also. Once I got the hang of it though, I started enjoying myself. My daily posts felt a little bit like a photo journal. The only problem was that I still only had one follower. I found myself wondering what the point of posting was when nobody was going to see my fabulous and very ‘real’ photos. The alarm bells in my head should have gone off right then and there, but instead of analyzing the problematic direction of my thinking, I began a BeReal following and recruiting spree. I wanted (needed! all of my friends to make an account so that I could show them how authentic I was being. Therein lies a big part of the problem, though I didn’t realize it immediately: creating a BeReal is simply another form ofsocial signaling. A few days later, my brain started churning. I noticed that I was spending a lot of time checking my phone and wondering when my BeReal notification would go off. When I was doing something interesting or out of the ordinary, I was very conscious of the potential for those moments to become a good BeReal post. Other times, I was in a state of emotional turmoil when my BeReal notification went off, and I suddenly felt violated and controlled — as though the app was telling me that if I didn’t share a picture of my tear-stained face within the next two minutes, then I was not being “real” enough. I dismissed that concern relatively quickly though, opting instead to focus on more important issues: I tried to figure out if I could view follower counts, wondered if I could publicize all of my past BeReal posts and considered making my account public instead of private. My vanity was certainly getting the best of me, but it appears that I am not the only BeReal user who has had these thoughts. Based on the questions posted in theFAQ sectionof BeReal’s official website, it would seem that many users are concerned about their image and how to further capitalize on and publicize their BeReal experience. Sprinkled amidst more technical questions about how certain app features work, one can spot the following questions, some of which are very similar to those that I was also asking: While this FAQ section may not be the best place to gauge public response to the app, I think we can safely assume that it does provide some insight into the concerns of a typical BeReal user — after all, the questions posted are presumably “frequently asked” ones. After seeing these questions and paying more attention to my own thoughts in relation to my BeReal profile, I realized that the effects BeReal had on me were alarmingly similar to those of other social media platforms. In other words, it became abruptly apparent that BeReal had failed in its mission to create the platform it is praised for being: an “anti-Instagram,” a cure to curation, a toxin-free alternative. So what exactly does BeReal market itself as? Which specific problems with traditional social media does the app claim to solve? First, social media, particularly Instagram, is very prone to promoting unrealistic body and beauty expectations, because users can apply filters to and/or edit their photos. I think BeReal was relatively successful in addressing this problem. The app has no built-in filtering or editing features and no possibility to upload potentially doctored photos taken outside of the app. In addition, BeReal records the number of times a photo has been retaken and makes that number public to a user’s followers. Second, BeReal and its defenders often argue that the app reduces screen time and encourages users to actually live their lives instead of spending time online. Unfortunately, I feel that BeReal exacerbates this issue rather than addressing it. Every BeReal post is marked with a time stamp. While this does create some additional transparency, the inclusion of a time stamp also essentially shames users for not being on their phones at the time of the notification or for prioritizing their own lives over a social media post. In a sense, in order to truly “be real” by the app’s standards, users actually have to pay more attention to their phones — and what does that mean for those who are less privileged and are perhaps working when they receive their urgent notification from BeReal? Should we shame their posts for being an hour or two late? Third, BeReal is intended to counter the overly-curated and unrealistic lifestyle expectations fostered by other social media platforms. I’m sure that all of us who have an Instagram account are familiar with those travel influencers who seem to lead an absolutely perfect life. Or maybe you have come across the“that girl” trend, which presents an aesthetic and extremely productive day, complete with a 5 a.m. wake-up time, meditation, morning workouts and protein smoothies. If you have seen any of those posts, you have almost certainly compared your own life to these beautifully-curated representations of someone else’s. Those of us who cannot afford travel, or who do not have a glamorous job that leaves us with the energy and time to wake up at 5 a.m. for a workout, have almost certainly felt downtrodden or jealous after viewing the aforementioned media. BeReal, through its reliance on and creation of trends on other social media platforms, also perpetuates these ideals. However, even the elimination of all other social media platforms and trends would not allow BeReal to extinguish this problem of comparison and privilege, since comparison is at the very core of social media as a concept. A user will always encounter a BeReal post that somehow speaks to and exposes a personal insecurity, even when those posts are all from close friends. It may seem at first that the conclusion (for the millionth time is that social media is the problem. To some extent, I believe that it is: a new form of social media cannot solve a problem of authenticity that is an integral part of the platform’s existence in itself. Yet, rather than claim that social media creates a problem, I would instead opt to say that it amplifies a struggle which is intrinsic to the human experience: competition. Competition can lead us to comparison and feelings of inadequacy, and competition can also lead us to exaggerated fakeness. It is understandable that recent trends in social media (even before BeReal rose to prominence capitalized on authenticity and realness; everyone wanted to be relatable and to feel less alone in their experiences. While social media has certainly helped many of us find connection, we might as well have found that in our friends and in day-to-day conversations. Personally, I greatly prefer the obvious fakeness of Instagram to the backhanded authenticity of BeReal though. Do I plan to delete either app? I doubt it; addiction turns us all into hypocrites.

crimson_2022_9,"Growing up, my family always reminded me that there’s beauty in the unknown; something that is new isn’t necessarily something to be afraid of. I mean, it works that way with food. I still remember my horror at eating grasshoppers for the first time in Oaxaca, Mexico. Everywhere I looked on my plate, a million beady eyes stared right into my soul. I took my first bite with my eyes squeezed shut — yet a few chews later, I realized that grasshoppers taste practically like chicken. Not so scary after all. Harvard is similar to eating grasshoppers. When I first chose Harvard, I was ecstatic — everything I’d ever worked toward was mine. But, as the months progressed, that overwhelming ecstasy morphed into a twisted feeling, reminiscent of my grasshopper-eating experience. I couldn’t stomach knowing that my life was about to drastically change. You see, 95 percent of Laredo, Texas, my hometown, is comprised of Hispanic or Latino Americans, and these demographics heavily influenced everyday life. I spoke in Spanish to my friends between classes, joked about the “chisme” circulating within our hallways, and learned from three Ms. Garcias, two Ms. Rodriguezes, and two Mr. Gonzalezes throughout my education. Whether I realized it or not, my Mexican culture enveloped me throughout my childhood and teenage years. When I came to Harvard, however, this comforting blanket was torn from me. For instance, people on campus were unable to say my name. I’m Silvana. Yet, throughout my first semester at Harvard, the name gifted to me by my mother morphed into Savannah, then Svetlana, then Sylvia, until I finally began asking people to “call me Silver…yes, like the metal.” Since my not-so-voluntary name change, I can probably count the number of people that have attempted to pronounce my actual name on two hands. My most jarring experience of culture shock at Harvard happened on Sept. 16, 2021, my first Mexican Independence Day away from home. I dressed in my handmade Oaxacan huipil, rebozo, and filigree jewelry. After struggling to apply my dried-out red lipstick, I left my Wigglesworth suite fully prepared for a Mariachi’s serenade — and needless to say, that wasn’t the case. Instead, I was met with a gloomy gray sky and soggy ground. September 16th may be commonly known as Mexican Independence Day (although some confuse it for May 5th , but in my calendar, it’s marked as the day when I realized I was no longer at home. Home, however, is with me wherever I go. I may not be as immersed in my Mexican culture as I am in Laredo, but I haven’t forgotten it. Whenever I see a Hispanic student on campus, I immediately have a full-blown conversation with them in Spanish, and I plan to dress up every September 16th, even if no one recognizes the cultural significance of my outfit. Although I haven’t been taught by another Ms. Garcia at Harvard, the proctor of the entryway I am a Peer Advising Fellow for coincidentally shares the same Iberian surname as my favorite 10th grade World History teacher. And sure, it sucks that I don’t hear my name as often anymore — especially considering its importance to my identity — but maybe “Silver” indicates the new person I’m becoming while I’m here. When my childhood friends ask me, “What’s Harvard like?” I’m unsure of what to tell them. A casual “it’s pretty cool” usually suffices, yet these words hide what it’s really like to be a Mexican-American student at Harvard. On the one hand, Harvard is a “land of opportunity,” where Wall Street geniuses invest billions of endowment dollars on our education. And as a Latina, I’m living, breathing proof that far-fetched dreams like Harvard can be reached with dedication and a “sí se puede.” However, the disconnect that exists within our communities is palpable. I’m ashamed of my homesickness, especially when I’m an “inspiration” to those who weren’t able to leave Laredo in the first place. Sometimes, I wish I could force people to pronounce my name correctly because I miss Silvana and what she represented. Yet, I appreciate everything Silver has done for me. Unfortunately, the disconnect I feel at Harvard is part of the deal. When we all chose Harvard, we chose to leave our homes, and with that, a part of our identities. However, this detachment shouldn’t be mourned. If anything, we’re each a missing puzzle piece that belongs to a different puzzle. Try fitting us together, and we won’t create a single image. But we all fit together somehow, even if imperfectly. Coming to Harvard detached me from my past identity, but introduced me to a version of myself that is equally as important. I’m still a missing puzzle piece, but I’m slowly finding people and communities that I see myself fitting in with. I now realize I’ve been so focused on keeping Silvana’s memory alive that I’ve missed out on the person I’m becoming. Exactly who that is, I’m not yet sure, but I’m excited to find out. Silvana Yarrington Pacchiano ’25 lives in Eliot House. This piece is part of a focus on Hispanic authors and experiences for Hispanic Heritage Month."
ubyssey_2022_15,"July 22, 2022 Written byStephanie Okoli Chidinma s head swayed with each judder of the helicopter. The wind was never friendly this time of year, and Devontee s piloting skills were questionable. Chidinma s tight curls brushed against her seat, making rustling noises that annoyed Devontee. He cocked his head in her direction to glare at her. But instead, his eyes widened at the sight of the dried-up bloodstains smeared across her face. Ah! Devontee yelled. His shriek struck Chidinma s ears and made her jolt out of her seat. Then, at once, Chidinma felt severe spasms across her body. The throbbing started from her head and pulsated down to her fingertips and toes. She tried to hold herself up, but her body had given up on her and she flopped on the helicopter controls. Ugh, Chidinma groaned. Devontee slapped on autopilot and gently laid Chidinma back into her seat. What happened?! Devontee said. Chioma s words echoed in her head. Don t trust the white man and the Black man that mindlessly follows him. Chidinma avoided eye contact and didn t utter a word. So, you re not going to tell me? Devontee exclaimed. We ve been partners for how long, but you don t even trust me enough to tell me why blood came out of your eyes! Chidinma bit her lip and looked out the window. Fine, he whispered. Dumb girl. The murmur was loud enough for Chidinma to hear. She sucked her teeth and Devontee retorted with the same sound of disrespect. Cleared for the ILS 24 Left, CSIS Toronto tower centre said. Cleared for the ILS 24 Left, thank you, Devontee replied. Chidinma, you better tell me what s going on now before we land. How are we supposed to explain the blood on your face! Cleared to land, CSIS tower centre said. Cleared to land. Thank you, Devontee said. You know the camera s probably caught whatever you did. He focused on the controls as they descended, but he squirmed at the sound of Chidinma whimpering. We re going to die… at least rub that shit off your face, Devontee said. The two finally land at CSIS Toronto. Chidinma and Devontee left the helicopter and stared down the runway. Their legs were stiff — they looked around, waiting for something, agents, snipers, servicemen. Chidinma had some power back, so she focused her energy on her eyes to scan the area. Devontee saw her eyes glow and nudged her. Using powers right now could be seen as an aggravated assault against the state, Devontee said. Shit, Chidinma said. The yellow in her eyes dwindled until the whites of her eyes resurfaced. I ll tell them you had nothing to do with it. They won t believe you either way, he said as his eyes watered. Let s go. The walk down the runway was haunted by all-consuming silence. CSIS officials knew they were coming, but darkness still covered the entrance. Only when they made it to the door did the premise lights beam in their faces. The studded-metal doors opened and revealed not a cluster of agents but Atak Lual. His low afro resembled Devontee s, and his three-piece suit was decorated with a Canadian flag pin. His eyes darted from Devontee to Chidinma, and his jaw clenched at the sight of the streaks of dried-up blood on Chidinma s face. Finally, his eyes shifted back to Devontee. You stay in front of her as a cover, he said. And you, Chidinma, keep your head down. No one needs to be asking questions. Follow me to my office. Atak strode past the glass-adorned corridor, and Chidinma and Devontee sped behind him. They entered the elevator and rode to the fifth floor, and b-lined for his corner office. Unfortunately, the beauty of the building had not reached his office. The carpet that stretched across the floor was knitted with rough material, and the walls were a dull grey. Atak collapsed in his seat behind his desk. Chidinma and Devontee watched as anxiety consumed him. He held his head in his hands while taking deep breaths. After the last deep breath, he shot his head up to look at the two. Both jumped and looked around the room to avoid eye contact. What the hell is going on? he said. Chioma sent me an urgent cryptic message basically pleading that I approved her reassignment request four hours ago. Those take weeks, maybe months, yet here you are. I couldn t reach her, and the hallway surveillance caught five CSIS agents storming her office. They are all missing now. Chidinma kept a straight face, but her heartbeat had escalated to new feats. The sweat rushed out her pores and started to smudge the blood on her face. Atak saw this and softened his tone. Take a seat. Chidinma and Devontee both sat down in the chairs across from his desk. My name is Atak Lual. Before I was an agent here, I was a state serviceman like the both of you. Chioma basically raised me back when we were serving in Nova Scotia. I just need to know what happened. 97567, Chidinma blurted out. Devontee and Atak spun towards her. Pardon? Atak said. 9-7-5-6-7, Chidinma said. What does that mean? Atak responded. I don t know, Chidinma said. You don t know, Atak said. His eyes shifted to Devontee, but he looked confused as well. Atak knew he could just be lying, but servicemen at their rank aren t trained in the art of deception. Where did you get the number from? Atak said. Chidinma stayed silent; her eyes grew emotionless. Look, I know Chioma, but I don t know you two. There s only so much I can do. I ve enlisted you in a new squad CSIS is forming that I m in charge of to stop higher-ups from asking questions. I ll take you both to your residence. Rest up.” The ride to the basement was quiet. Chidinma made sure to control her breathing, so both wouldn t notice her hyperventilating. When she finally got to her room, she collapsed on her twin bed. She silently wept for some time before entering her shower. She washed all the blood and grime off, and her coily hair shrunk up. Pain still ate at her muscles. She did her best to hide it outside, but here, she hobbled to bed and waited for CSIS agents to barge in until she fell asleep. Chidinma awoke to knocks at her door. It followed a familiar annoying rhythm she knew. She swung her door open. Your afro is lopsided, Devontee said. No one loves you, Chidinma said. Your mom does, Devontee said. Get dressed. We have to meet Atak soon. Chidinma kissed her teeth and gestured to him to come in. After breakfast, Chidinma and Devontee were summoned to the west-wing training facility for day one of training and squad introductions. CSIS headquarters was the most expensive government facility in the country, and it showed. State of the art gym, indoor track and combat assimilation centre. The duo stumbled in, distracted by the money, only to come back to focus due to a scoff. An all-Black CSIS squad, May said. Cute. Chidinma eyed the young woman judging them — brown skin, pronounced cheekbones, curled dreadlocks and brown eyes full of annoyance. It s Canada s way of showing diversity, Atak said. Segregation? Mary said. We ll be the first of many diversified squads to protect Canada and her allies, Atak said. There might be many to come, but we re definitely not the first, May said. Devontee leaned to Chidinma s ear. You two will get along great, he said. Chidinma rolled her eyes. Everyone gather ‘round, Atak said. Let s introduce ourselves. I ll start: Atak Lual, rank A commander officer. May Jackson, rank B, agent. Devontee Brown, rank D, serviceman. Chidinma Nwankwo, rank D,servicewoman. Chidinma felt May judging her. It didn t make sense for rank D s to accompany people of her and Atak s position. Chidinma ignored her illusions and played the game as she always did, quiet but aware. Every day followed the same routine: eat, school, aggressive workouts and sleep. Even though no one questioned Chidinma, her anxiety haunted her. She kept waiting to disappear. She watched everything and everyone, especially May. Chidinma knew that by 6:00 a.m., May took walks around the premises; by 7:00 a.m. would be in the library reading about liberation movements and Black heroes; 8:00 a.m. is when she ate breakfast: scrambled eggs and spinach usually; 9:00 a.m. was school; by 3:00 p.m. was training time which was supposed to end at 5:00 p.m. but it usually would go until curfew. Something about May was off. The two of them never talked, but one day in the locker room, Chidinma jumped at her and backed her into a corner. You good? May said. 97567, Chidinma said. Huh? May said. 9-7-5-6-7, Chidinma said. May raised an eyebrow and pushed Chidinma out the way. Weirdo, May said. Later at night, Chidinma watched her door with the lights on until she dozed off as usual. Muffled sounds made Chidinma jolt out of bed. Her eyes sparkled with yellow, ready to attack. Chidinma whipped her head around to see May with her eyes engulfed in purple. May closed her open hand into a fist. Chidinma felt every muscle contract in her body. Her arms wrapped around her body and her legs slammed together. Veins protruded out of May s face as violet shot out her eyes into Chidinma s. Finally, the yellow was taken over and purple popped out her veins. May smiled as her voice entered Chidinma s head. Let s try this again, May thought. Let s see everything you know about 97567. To read the first chapter ofThe Servicewoman, clickhere.

stanforddaily_2022_101,"“Practice the tolerance you preach,” “Give speech a chance,” and “Tolerance includes listening.” The Stanford College Republicans (SCR taped posters bearing these phrases around Dinkelspiel Auditorium in anticipation of two very different visitors; former Vice President Mike Pence for his talk on “How to save America from the Woke Left,” as well as the supposed “Woke Left” anti-Pence organizers who came to protest his visit. While anti-Pence protesters prepared a rally in anticipation of this event, there has been increasing discussion of the customary “freedom of speech” plea that comes along with inviting a controversial speaker to campus. The importance of freedom of speech has dominated campus conversation for the days preceding this event — and with the confrontation between different political groups in Dinkelspiel today, there is a lot to be said about how Stanford can protect students’ right to freely engage in political discourse. Despite the emphasis on free speech, many students of color and students from marginalized backgrounds have limited freedom of speech amidst a polarized political climate and aggressive practices such as doxxing, harassment, and other hostile interactions. It is Stanford’s most vulnerable population that remains most at risk from these attacks — and with an open campus, it is unclear what kind of unwanted outside attention a Pence event could bring and how it could affect these marginalized students. Take Ritwik Tati ’25, for example, a co-organizer of the anti-Pence protest. While protesting Pence’s presence on campus, Tati reflected on his own experience with being doxxed by opposing groups on campus. In Tati’s account, opposing groups spread dangerous and untrue claims about him online, complete with personal screenshots and links to his social media accounts. This represented a direct exposure that put Tati at risk of receiving hate online, simply because of his leftist beliefs. Another student from the class of 2025, who asked to remain anonymous due to privacy and security concerns, claimed that standing outside Dinkelspiel during the Pence event “is not a safe space for students of color to protest. Some of us have midterms so that’s why we’re not here. The rest of us know how mentally taxing it can be.” The political climate surrounding the auditorium and fear of aggressive practices such as doxxing inhibited students’ ability to engage in what would have been otherwise healthy discourse. The same anonymous student simply did not want to be quoted on what dorm they lived in, out of fear that it could put them in a position to receive hate from groups on or off campus. It was hard for me to see the “freedom of speech” outside Dinkelspiel when unhealthy political practices clearly created too hostile of an environment for a large population of students to engage with Pence’s visit to campus. Within an hour of Pence giving his speech, tension stayed high around Dinkelspiel with patrolling security members, SCR organizers, anti-Pence protesters, and the everyday passersby strolling through White Plaza. I saw one Stanford freshman — a hijabi — approached and interrogated on her affiliation with the anti-Pence organizers. She was a passerby who truly had no allegiance to any political group organizing that day. But her mere appearance put her in a position to be questioned and taunted in a naturally hostile way — the stakeswerehigh and therewereaccusations of aggressive protesters, but she simply had nothing to do with it. At the same time, there were many cases of people aggressively filming their surroundings inside and outside of Dinkelspiel, leaving little space for genuine conversation and political discourse around the auditorium. Some of this aggression can be expected with a controversial speaker like Pence coming to campus; however, hostile individual behaviors exacerbated the issue, ultimately discouraging more marginalized groups to speak freely on their opinions. “The first thing my parents’ told me was to proceed with caution,” the same anonymous student said. While the SCR and anti-Pence protesters exercised their freedom of speech in and out of Dinkelspiel today, there is a larger conversation to be had about unheard student voices, and how we as a community can foster more productive debate among different groups on campus. Students affiliated with the anti-Pence protesters alleged that the Pence event organizers voided tickets from people they believed might walk out. One student I spoke to, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of being targeted, claimed that the process of voiding tickets could have involved the “racial-profiling” of names on the event roster, based on their observation that some students of color — who were not publicly affiliated with the anti-Pence protesters — were escorted out. These allegations are speculative, but regardless of whether or not these claims were true, the expulsion of student protestors represents an unwillingness to hear both sides of the issue. Regardless of whether you stood inside or outside Dinkelspiel today, it is clear that there needs to be a greater emphasis on safe student disagreement and discourse without the personal attacks and risk that comes along with political affiliation. This could be achieved through more frequent political engagement between opposing groups on campus, a greater reassurance of security for Stanford students who would like to attend these types of events and the willingness of the Stanford administration to get involved in cases of political harassment and doxxing. The protection of free speech on our campus can only start with the protection and reassurance of our students’ ability to organize, protest and disagree with controversial speakers.

stanforddaily_2022_71,"Alex Young, a masters student in chemical engineering, is a Founding Member of Abolish Stanford Greek and a former ISC sorority member.Abolish Stanford Greek is a coalition of students, alumni and faculty dedicated to ending the presence of historically white IFC/ISC Greek organizations on Stanford’s campus. The group has more than 700petitionsigners and 2,000 followers overTwitterandInstagram. The University’s recentdecisionto house five Interfraternity Council (IFC and six Intersorority Council (ISC organizations next year demonstrates the administration’s utter disregard for student welfare. The plan silences the voices of countless students harmed by Greek life, ignores the clear majority of students whowantGreek life unhoused, and shows a lack of good faith in dealing with student advocates. In summer 2020, the student group Abolish Stanford Greek (ASG released itsfounding op-edurging Stanford to withdraw recognition of historically white IFC/ISC organizations. ASG’s founders had tried to reform their Greek chapters, soften the racism andclassismof recruitment, transform the misogyny andheteronormativityof social events, and erase the transphobia of gendered housing. They found, however, that national organizationsforcechapters to reinforce elitist, toxic and inequitable structures on our campus, no matter how sincere Greek student leadership may be in trying to reform. In fall 2020, the group presented an ASSUresolutionto redistribute the ten Row houses reserved for IFC/ISC organizations back to the housing draw. Supporters highlighted the unfairness of a wealthy, white quarter of the student body occupying a third of Row houses. Apologistspointedto the community benefits of Greek life, but could not explain how such benefits were (a exclusive to Greek life, (b worth the harm, or (c deserving of prime real estate on campus. Even the most avid proponents recognized the damage that Greek life has caused at Stanford, fromhazingandeating disorders, tosexual assault,druggings, anddeath. As a result, the president of the IFC and Phi Kappa Psi, Terrell Edwards ‘21,stepped downfrom his position to support the resolution, stating that “Greek life needs the university to help it move forward, and I think unhousing is a great first step towards that … unhousing presents the University with the opportunity to acknowledge underrepresented people on the Row.” As Senator Leah Harris ‘21 put it, “I’m not sure why Greek orgs need to be housed to reform .” The resolution passed with supermajorities in both theUndergraduate SenateandGraduate Student Council, sending it to the Faculty Senate (where faculty could make recommendations . But the matter wastabledin winter 2021, with Vice Provost Susie Brubaker-Cole arguing that greater student input was needed. This was a point that the administrators stressed to ASG meeting after meeting; even with minority harms established, what was the majority student opinion? The question has been answered; ASG joined Greek representatives on a neutral ASSUcommitteeto conduct a student body-wide survey in 2021. With a high and representative turnout, thesurveyfound that 83% of undergraduates wanted to see some change in the Greek system, with 58% of undergraduates supporting unhousing Greek organizations in spring 2021. This percentage matched the 60% support for unhousing found in the Daily’s fall 2020survey. The ASSU exec and ASG both met with administrators in separate meetings in spring 2021 to review the survey results and convey the ASSU recommendations to unhouse. In June 2021, the administrationannouncedmostly single-year assignments for ten Greek houses, in a break from previous four-year assignments. ASG saw this as an incremental victory — an opportunity for the administration to see the oxymoronic impossibility of “equity, inclusion, and diversity” in Greek life that arose to protectwealthy networks, as higher education diversified. Throughout the 2021–2022 school year, ASG tried to meet with Vice Provost Brubaker-Cole and other administrators. In January, a promised meeting was understandably delayed as the Office of Student Engagement juggled rapidly changing COVID-19 restrictions. From January through March 2022,ASG received five separate emailsfrom administrative schedulers confirming that a group meeting was being arranged to discuss housing allocations. In the meantime, ASG sent updates, including atransitional proposalfor a smaller number of Greek houses and dorms, to reduce Greek life’s disproportionate dominance over the Row. But on March 10, without meeting with ASG, the administration acted. The Office of Student Engagement informed Greek chapters that they plan toincreasethe number of housed IFC/ISC organizations from ten to eleven, and add one Multicultural Greek organization. The new addition is Kappa Alpha, the fraternity previouslyunhousedfor taking on non-paying boarders and also the site of thesexual assaultof Chanel Miller. According to a March 9 LEAD 150 class presentation by three KA members, the chapter today is 75% white, compared to the 32.4% white study body. Administrators know that the majority of students and victims of Greek life oppose these allocations. That may be why it took the university three weeks after informing chapters of their housing status to quietlypublishtheir retrenchment of segregated Greek housing to the broader campus community. Why do dues-only, selective-membership Greek organizations deserve campus houses over the 650+ open-membership clubs? No one has been able to explain why administrators believed to be acting in the interest of students did not listen to students — neither the majority who called for unhousing, nor ASG’s 700petitionsigners, nor the 150+ people who providedtestimonials. Nor can anyone explain how administrators can continue to ignore statistics about the dangers of Greek houses, the fact that many fraternities have expressedwillingnessto unhouse or reconcile such action with ResX’srecognitionthat the Row reflects “concerning demographic trends” (read: is overwhelmingly white . ASG has found only one explanation for all this: donor influence. Since ASG’s founding, Greek organizations have organized letter-writing campaigns for their alumni to implore the Stanford administration to ignore ASG. Manylettershave included threats of donation-withholding if the school takes steps to unhouse Greek life. This is significant because it is well-known that Greek alumnidonate moreto their universities than non-Greek alumni. Given that wealthy, connected students tend to join Greek life, it is also unsurprising that Greeks tend to be thewealthiestand the most powerful alumni. We suspect these letters drove the administration to house eleven IFC/ISC organizations next year. It also seems likely that concerns about alumni donations have motivated the university to continue recognizing Greek organizations and award them with administrative support and special institutional privileges likeoff-campus banking, that no other clubs are allowed. Next year’s housing allocations are a reminder that the Stanford administration embodies the status quo. Donor interestsdriveouradministrators, even when those interests run counter to student safety, housing equity, minority protections, and majority opinion.

ubyssey_2022_42,"Jan. 16, 2022 Written byCoby Derban Dear UBC and Santa Ono, You are making a terrible decision to shut down again. We paid full (sorry, if you didn t catch that: FULL tuition for 18 months of joke school. Our lives collapsed. Our tangible education devolved into a mind-numbing waste. We use the vapid euphemism mental health all the time, but we obviously have no idea what it means. Now we re vaccinated, like you asked. We went back for four months, packed in shoulder-to-shoulder onto the R4 and 99. We pretended it was fine, because goddamn, was it nice to be back. To feel some echo of direction again. To almost feel like real people. To almost stagger out of the horrific fact that thousands of hyper-social apes torched years of their lives. A stellar focus on mental health. Oh, yes. Thanks for the counselling services. Yes, obviously that s the problem. If only we pay you for more student services. That s why I m at UBC: for that sweet feeling of hemorrhaging money to feed a buzzing swarm of ridiculous programmatic ornamentation. Almost as nice as ticks. We pay so much money to get educated. Most of us still believe that we are actually, somehow, still being educated. Some of us take out crippling loans that will leave our coming years in smoking financial ruin. We do that because we still believe. We try to believe. Are we going to have to pay full price for an ersatz product? Do we again get to squander thousands of dollars and months of pseudo-life for the privilege of participating in insipid satire? Please do not do this to us again. I think I ll be able to handle it. I m four months from escaping this rent-seeking dream world. But some of us won t handle it. ‘Mental health.’ A place of mind. At least refrain from continuing, unabated, to harvest dollars we do not have for our opportunity to feel like dupes and fools. I would like to share an excerpt of a talk given by a UBC faculty member that I dearly respect: You might think of some of the phrases one hears about UBC, for example. Take the claim that it is ‘your’ education, or degree. This is often linked to the image of the university as a locus of ‘innovation,’ a “place of mind” that emphasizes ‘engagement,’ while fostering ‘community’ and ‘well-being.’ One of the more egregious moments was when the university announced that it was ‘here for us’ at the start of COVID-19 , but then told students to pay the normal tuition a few weeks later.” “Meanwhile, despite the upbeat rhetoric, the UBC administration encourages faculty to be mindful of their ‘outcomes,’ a notion that turns us into machines of production. And we should all strive towards ‘excellence,’ while building a ‘university of excellence’ at UBC. What is university education really about, especially if it is increasingly expensive and online? Do we even understand teaching and learning, which are allegedly the cores of education? Look, I know some of you are really going to hate this. In so many ways this sentiment has become immoral. There are, after all, no breaks on the clandestine ideology of our time and its histrionic fixation on the veneer of safety. There are other axes of wellbeing than physiological quantification. We ve become so obsessed with metrics of safety that we have forgotten what health means. Just because you can t stuff it into a number and scare the populace with it does not mean it s not a mortal concern. If we’re going to keep bringing our lives to a grinding halt should we not do so for climate change or nuclear disarmament? How about the epidemic of suicide and overdose deaths? If we’re going to keep slamming the brakes on life for that impossible idol of absolute safety, are we really going to get scammed in the process? I am far from the only person who feels this way. If this resonates with you, consider trying to say something. Sign a petition, write to the school. If you think this is evil, please do not bother trying to argue in the comments. Everyone knows that is a spiritually destitute waste of time. Most likely this will do absolutely nothing. Worth a go, nonetheless. I’m too old and obstreperous to keep biting my tongue. I m too old for this shit. Imagine, as Nietzsche did, that you had to live this life again and again for eternity. Would you then choose to squander yet more time? Is there no better way?

wildcat_arizona_2022_64,"People experiencing homelessness in Tucson along Fourth Avenue. As young people, many of us often feel like we are invincible. We look out the window and observe all the awful things in the world, things we think could never happen to us. I think it’s time we realize this notion couldn’t be further from the truth. More times than I would like, I have seen University of Arizona students address the homeless population here in Tucson in a way that is worse than how most people treat their dogs. I’ve seen people take videos of these people experiencing homelessness and poverty as if they are a laughable commodity to be shared and sent on social media. I observe these disappointing actions and while, yes, I am bothered — I am reminded of the delusion that so many of us young people carry. That this couldn’t happen to us. That there is some large division between us and those on the street, as if we are two separate beings in two different worlds. As students — but more importantly, as humans — it’s time to learn how to help, not judge. I spoke with UA professor Brian Mayer, creator of the Poverty in Tucson Field workshop. Together, we had a conversation about how the project was born and what students can do about poverty here in Tucson. “It got started, the idea, probably all the way back to 2012. The first course was offered in 2015. In 2012, the U.S. census office released the census data and placed Tucson as the eighth poorest city of its size. That was unsurprising but to have that label created was challenging,” Mayer said. The census data created a domino effect, of sorts, which led to the City of Tucson contacting the UA School of Sociology to collect some data about poverty and homelessness in the area. Mayer said one of the biggest questions behind the data was to find out whether the poverty threshold really measured material deprivation in Tucson or is the cost of living lower than a city like New York and the same poverty measure is being used. To answer this question, the Poverty in Tucson workshop was created with the intention to create a course where students can learn about the root causes and consequences of poverty. By doing this and educating students, they can become a part of the future generation to solve this problem and apply the information to real life. The class, which is taught in the sociology department, focuses mainly on research where students interview various households and families in Tucson to help understand poverty firsthand and learn about possible solutions. Studentsconduct surveyswithin these households, analyzing them and presenting the data back to the community at a forum hosted by the UA College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. RELATED:OPINION: Self love is not selfish So, how is this information helping the homeless and impoverished in Tucson? “We feed that data back to other city agencies and nonprofits looking to improve their service delivery to households that need it. We can help to add insight as to what’s going on on the ground. That’s been the challenge of the course, and it’s been a fun and exciting thing we’ve been doing since 2015,” Mayer said. Perhaps what is the most innovative part of the course is that students are interacting with these households one-on-one. They aren’t learning about poverty through a screen, or by reading an online text — they are seeing it firsthand. I found this to be incredibly important to separate the divide that so many of us unconsciously carry in our minds. We cannot look from the outside in and expect to create real change — Poverty in Tucson exemplifies that perfectly. I asked Mayer what he thinks are the first steps into ending the stigma against poverty and what students can do to make a difference. “I think we change the terms that we use,” Mayer said. “In my class, we change the terms. We say people experiencing poverty or people experiencing homelessness. We don’t say poor people or homeless people because it becomes a descriptor of who they are. It infers something about their character that we can’t possibly know without interacting with them.” A small step like this can make big waves in Tucson. I finished the conversation with Mayer by asking him what the most rewarding part of his work and teaching the course has been. “I run into people all the time. They’re like ‘Dr. Mayer, I took your course. I had a notion of what poverty was or what experiencing homelessness was like, but I never really had a chance to interact with people like that.’ Listening to their story, it really inspired me to go on,” Mayer said. Mayer definitely isn’t the only one inspired. In order for change to occur, we must first offer our humility and understanding. It’s the least we can do as students here in Tucson — the least we can do as humans. Follow Olivia Krupp onTwitter Olivia is a freshman who has yet to declare her major.

wildcat_arizona_2022_13,"Cooper Temple/ The Daily Wildcat A costumed dragon attracts prospective students during the club fair on the UA mall. This was one of the many interests and oddities shown off on campus, Tuesday, Aug. 26, 2014, in Tucson, Arizona. The fear of missing out on the “true college experience” has pushed me into various clubs, friend groups, opportunities and classes. While I disagree with overscheduling yourself to appease some stereotype that college provides the best four years of your life, I think sitting back and watching life happen around you rather than finding new opportunities is costly. You’re paying for your degree, but you’re also paying for the experience. During job interviews I talked more about the clubs and organizations I joined than the experiences I found within the classroom. While we are here to learn, we are also on a campus that brings so much opportunity and room for discovering your hobbies, interests and desires. Making the most out of every minute of your college experience doesn’t translate to getting sloshed whenever possible. It’s utilizing these resources presented to you on such a large campus and running with them. While romanticizing the college experience can turn into a spiral of unmet expectations, being present and actively seeking out new experiences can be incredibly rewarding. RELATED:OPINION: Let’s talk about toxic positivity I’m not advising you to overload your schedule with collegiate obligations, but join something that keeps you grounded to the campus. Join something that ties you to your peers outside of your class schedule. Developing relationships beyond the classroom is essentially the foundation of the college experience and if you can accomplish this, no one can say your experience was lacking. But, on the other hand, do it. Absolutely romanticize your college experience. It’s the only time you are living this moment, and if fist-pumping on an elevated surface makes you feel like the main character of your story, keep doing it. If you look back through your Snapchat memories and find yourself cringing, at least you know you’ve grown. Wanting to fit into the college lifestyle isn’t a crime, just know that you don’t have to. There are so many groups on campus that will welcome you with open arms. If going to the frats isn’t your ideal Thursday night, it doesn’t have to be written into your schedule. You don’t have to be living someone else’s ideal college experience, but try your best to live yours. This year, I told myself I wanted to branch out to as many groups on campus as possible. While I’ve been super busy, I’ve met a plethora of people that have enriched my life. If I wasn’t chasing my ideal college experience by joining these clubs and organizations, I would never have developed these relationships. RELATED:OPINION: It is okay to not have a plan after graduation While being in Model United Nations may not sound like a direct route to the romanticized college experience, I have witnessed friendships flourish throughout my years in the club. Getting to know this group has been incredibly rewarding and they’ve all taught me so much. College is about branching out and trying new things. My major has literally no relation to the United Nations, but debating nerds over the economic futures of our representative countries has kept me connected to campus. Finding your ideal college experience can look entirely different from someone else finding theirs. The important thing is to lean far from comparison and seek out what provides you your own satisfaction. Get involved. Get involved. Get involved. Just join something. Joining even one organization can uplift your life incredibly in college. I started school in the spring and didn’t participate in anything outside the classroom. When I look back at my years here, that is the one semester I feel like I wasted. While I met a few amazing people, I was holding myself back from opportunities that could’ve kept me invested in my freshman year. Instead, I was desperately waiting for summer to come so I could pack up my dorm and leave. Now, I’ve joined so many different organizations on campus and have watched my college experience develop into something I’m loving every day. Romanticize that SunLink ride. Try something new. Seek opportunities. Don’t watch college happen, live it. FollowMaggie Landonon Twitter Maggie Landon (she/her is a finance major at the University of Arizona.

ubyssey_2022_35,"March 7, 2022 Written byNathan BawaanandCharlotte Alden Last year, only 6.9 per cent of the UBC Vancouver student body voted. Ha-ha, but seriously. That’s only 4,233 students out of the more than 60,000 student body. That means that despite being elected, your current representatives don’t represent most of you — they represent the seven per cent of you that gave enough of a damn to vote last year. This is not intended to shame you in any way — the last two years have been overwhelming, scary and sad. Finding time to vote for your student government representatives when navigating a global pandemic or coping with an onslaught of racial and climate injustices is not a priority for most people. We get that. But this year is different. Most people are back on campus. The whole world seems to be trying to return to normal while a pandemic is still raging and people are still dying every day from COVID-19. That makes your vote all the more important. Last year showed, more than any other year that we’ve been at UBC, that student government matters. In the last year, your AMS, the student senators on the UBC Vancouver Senate and the student representatives on the Board of Governors have pushed hard for students. They’re the reason why Proctorio was restricted across the university, why the drop date deadline was extended earlier this term, why some finals moved online at the end of the exam period in December, why students now have access to free KN95 masks, why you have $500 more for mental health coverage… we could go on. Whether you agreed with these decisions or not, it’s hard to deny that students had an impact. This is not to be a celebratory piece for all the incumbents running this year — many of them have flaws and have made mistakes, and we aren’t afraid to point those out. But this year showed that what the student government does have a direct impact on students. There are also this year’s referendum questions. If you happened to forget about them, we wouldn’t blame you — there weren’t any last year and the year before then feels like a lifetime ago. Nevertheless, referenda are just as important to vote in as the other races on your ballot. If you care about how much you pay in fees, a few of the referendum questions this year allow you to decide on specific fee increases and fee reductions, as well as whether you can opt-out of certain fees digitally. There is also a question on some bylaw and constitution changes which could have an impact on the AMS’s financial transparency. If you didn’t vote last year, we get it. Not many people care as much as we do about all of this. After all, it’s our job to keep up and keep you informed. So it’s also our duty to tell you to vote. Less than seven per cent of the student body voting does not result in a representative democracy. And there’s no benefit to not being properly represented. So this year, find the time to vote. Take the time to translate your angry Reddit comments and venting sessions with your friends about the AMS and UBC into action. Voting is open until March 11here.

rice_thresher_2022_29,"ByBen Baker-KatzandMorgan Gage8/23/22 9:21pm Each year, past editors in chiefs have penned welcome letters to the Rice community about their goals for the upcoming year. Many of them have urged the community to trust the Thresher in our pursuit of accurate, thorough reporting and storytelling. We enter this year with a similar goal, but we don’t have an ask of our community or our readers. Instead, we are calling on ourselves to reach out to the Rice community as a whole and meet the standards of journalistic integrity that our community deserves and that we expect of ourselves. As we begin our tenure as editors in chief, we are acutely aware of instances when Thresher coverage attracted the ire of readers and social media commenters. We welcome this criticism; it is both a reminder of how we can improve and a sign of when we’re doing our job right. As the only student-run news publication at Rice, we see ourselves as playing a vital role in facilitating campus discourse. But we understand that trust is earned, not given. So, we are taking steps that we believe will help us earn that trust. Moving into this semester, we’re investing more time and resources in longer form stories in an effort to more holistically and responsibly report on complex issues that are relevant to our community. Additionally, we are expanding our online coverage to incorporate data journalism and multimedia storytelling to tell more compelling stories. We are attempting to strengthen our relationship with the Rice community itself. In that spirit, we will be hosting office hours Thursday, Aug. 25 from 4 to 6 p.m. in the Rice Memorial Center’s Ley Conference Room. This is a chance for all members of the Rice community including students, staff and faculty to ask any questions they have about the Thresher as a publication or about our processes and goals. Beyond that, we are hosting monthly “Lunch and Learns” with journalism professionals, to which all graduate and undergraduate students on campus are invited to sign up. For years, as a part of our staff training, we have asked everyone on the masthead to collectively choose one value that embodies the Thresher’s mission. Without fail, we have selected “trustworthy” each time. We rely on the campus community to trust our integrity even when they don’t agree with the content that we’re publishing. As editors of the Thresher, we love Rice and the values we believe it embodies. Our work in student media is an extension of that love. We wouldn’t do it otherwise. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_128,"Harvard University recently released a report on its “entanglements with slavery” and announced the establishment of a $100 million fund to research and redress its historic ties to that abominable institution. The report, “Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery,” identifies more than 70 slaves owned by Harvard faculty and staff before abolition in 1783, various donors who had made money from slavery, and various faculty members and administrators of the past who held racist views. But the report gives much less attention to the ways in which Harvard graduates, faculty, and staff contributed to the end of slavery and to racial progress since the Civil War. As a Harvard-trained historian and former faculty member, I find this imbalance disturbing. The report does discuss the prominent antebellum abolitionists who had graduated from Harvard or worked there, but it spends far more time listing selected Harvard affiliates who owned slaves before 1783, when Massachusetts abolished the institution. As the data in the report shows, Harvard men favored the Union over the Confederacy by a wide margin during the Civil War. Union soldiers from Harvard outnumbered Confederates by 1,358 to 304, and 176 Union soldiers died, compared to 70 Confederates. The report does not mention that the builders of Memorial Hall, where the names of the Harvard Union dead are honored, did not memorialize those 70 graduates, presumably because they were traitors who had fought to destroy the Union and preserve slavery. The sum of dead Confederate soldiers from Harvard and the report-mentioned Harvard faculty and staff who owned a confirmed total of 70 slaves before 1783 falls considerably short of the total of Union dead from Harvard, to say nothing of the larger number who fought and survived. Many Harvard graduates, who by-and-large go unrecognized in the report, played critical roles in anti-slavery politics. John Quincy Adams, Class of 1787, became the leading enemy of slavery in Congress after his presidency and waged a successful campaign to end the gag rule against discussion of slavery on the floor of the House. He also suggested the usage of war powers to emancipate the slaves if Southern states seceded. Supreme Court Justice Benjamin R. Curtis, Class of 1829, who graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, wrote a scathing dissent in the 1857 Dred Scott case that upheld slavery and claimed that Black people could never be U.S. citizens. Charles Sumner, Class of 1830, receives a few mentions in the report, but he was one of the leading abolitionists in the Senate in the late 1850s (and was nearly murdered because of it . He later played a critical role in drafting and promoting Reconstruction legislation and constitutional amendments to give freed slaves equal rights. While the report closely examines the role of Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Class of 1829, in the expulsion of Black students and promotion of race science within the University as Dean of Harvard Medical School, it says nothing about his son Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Class of 1861. The younger Holmes graduated from Harvard College in 1861 and immediately volunteered for the Union Army, in which he survived three wounds. Later, as a Supreme Court Justice, Holmes wrote some of the first court opinions protecting civil rights in the South. His 1927 majority opinion in Nixon v. Herndon attempted to outlaw whites-only primaries in Texas. In Moore v. Dempsey (1923 , he led the court in throwing out a murder conviction of five Arkansas men on the grounds that the whole proceeding had taken place in an atmosphere of racist intimidation. The report also omits critical contributions to racial progress from some of Harvard’s most famous alumni. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1903, made vital contributions to Black American progress. Roosevelt’s New Deal provided critical economic help to Black Americans, and his wartime Fair Employment Practices Commission ensured that they received a fair share of jobs in defense plants. The success of the New Deal in fostering racial progress is evident in the bulk of Black voters who shifted from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party as a result. Three administrations later, John F. Kennedy ’40 used federal troops to integrate two Southern universities. In June of 1963, his last year of office, he introduced what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the wake of his death. Similarly, the report points out that Charles Hamilton Houston, the Howard Law School dean who trained Thurgood Marshall and helped design the strategy that led to Brown v. Board of Education, received his law degree from Harvard, as did two of Marshall’s fellow attorneys in that case, William H. Hastie Jr. and William T. Coleman Jr. — but it does not mention that Felix Frankfurter, a graduate and former faculty member at Harvard Law School, sat on the court that handed down that unanimous decision. Much of this abolitionist and civil rights history is familiar, or ought to be. But it is in danger of being subsumed by modern efforts to recast history with a blinkered reading of the past. Whatever their intention, the distinguished academics who signed the Harvard report contributed to the now-popular image of the racial history of the United States: an unremitting struggle between racist whites and oppressed nonwhites. Both white and Black Americans have been fighting for racial equality at least since the time of the American Revolution — which is why we no longer have slavery and legal segregation in the United States. Today’s popular one-sided view is effective propaganda, but terrible history. David E. Kaiser ’69 is a historian and former assistant professor in the Harvard University Department of History from 1976 to 1980."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_22,"President Joe Bidendeclaredthat completely reopening all schools in fall 2021 was “essential” back in August of 2021. Throughout the course of the pandemic, parents of K-12 studentshave become more concernedwith their childrens’ academic status and emotional well-being than with the risk of students and teachers contracting and spreading COVID-19. These concerns are valid, especially for children in their formative years; however, safety should always be the first priority. Biden’s statement and parents’ mindset shift reflect the American society’s understandable desire to return back to normalcy. But, in reality, our pre-COVID-19 way of life can never be recovered. Many employees are accustomed to being expected to work at an on-site office, but working from home has boomed in popularity since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schedule flexibility is nowone of the top factorsin employee retention. Industries like grocery delivery and telehealthcare are here to stay, as well. From this point onwards, American individuals possess more options to customize their lives than any generation. Industries are shifting to recognize the clear demand for more virtual goods and services, and the field of education should be next. In fact, the concept of online education is relatively old in comparison to these newer movements. The University of Phoenix instituted the first online degree programin 1989, and online universities have become more prevalent since then, with universities such as Southern New Hampshire University and Capella University being founded soon after. The main benefits of attending classes in person are increased interactions with classmates and instructors and arguably a better learning environment. Asurveyof about 13,500 college students in July of 2020 showed that students taking online classes were most concerned with maintaining engagement in their learning. Some may be concerned that online school is too easy to cheat in, or that students will lose out on the true school experience if they opt for online classes. These are valid criticisms, but online learning also offers safety and unparalleled convenience. To mitigate the impact of cheating, for instance, instructors can utilize proctoring services like ProctorU and modify their tests by including more free-response questions. UC Irvine resumed in-person classes on Jan. 31, early in the winter quarter. As soon as the decision wasannouncedon Jan. 21, it was already clear that UCI made the choice based on an artificial need for in-person instruction. Almost immediately, ASUCI and Associated Graduate Students (AGS responded with ajoint statementthat asserted they were never consulted preceding UCI’s decision, contrary to what UCI published in their statement. UCI’s navigation of this situation turned into amassive scandal, and they wererightfully criticizedfor being inconsiderate of the safety of their students and faculty, not providing statistics that support their decision to restart in-person learning, and lying about having discussions with student government. Following up with this criticism, UCI administration has sinceprivately apologized to student leadership. In an email to students regarding the upcoming spring quarter, UCI projected that fully online courses will be “extremely limited,” and that the vast majority of courses will be taught “in-person.” The email specifies that those whoregisteror have registered with the Disability Services Center to obtain “approved accommodations” will have access to their accommodations. This makes learning more accessible to UCI students, but UCI still needs to take more action to increase accessibility. As the full return to in-person instruction during spring quarter approaches us, UCI should be prioritizing flexibility as every student has differing priorities and living situations at the moment. For example, UCI has a large proportion of students who commute to campus, and they will be expected to fully attend in-person classes in the midst ofsoaringgas prices. Students may be immunocompromised, or in close contact with someone who is. A hybrid option should be offered if it is feasible, but unfortunately, not every professor is willing to do this. Pressuring students to attend classes in person is unprofessional, dangerous and unnecessary. We’re old enough to decide whether we want to learn in the classroom or not. The argument isn’t that everyone should go to school virtually; it’s that everybody should be able to choose the option they want. Through this pandemic, we have already proven that in-person school is not necessary, and to an extent, it never was. Daniel Waters is an Opinion Intern for the 2022 winter quarter.

wildcat_arizona_2022_44,"An illustration of the Democratic Party’s donkey and the Republican Party’s elephant fighting at a poll booth. Image by Farrah Rodriguez. With the days narrowing before the Nov. 8 general election, many Arizona residents will soon decide who to vote in as the next leader of their state as governor: Democrat Katie Hobbs or Republican Kari Lake. TheDaily WildcatOpinions Desk offers up a few reasons why Hobbs is the clear choice over her conservative counterpart. Over everything else, we encourage you to get to the polls and vote. Your voice counts and it’s important to make it heard. Katie Hobbs (D Secretary Katie Hobbs is an Arizona native who has spent her career helping Arizonans. After graduating college from Northern Arizona University and attending graduate school at Arizona State University, she began work as asocial worker, where she immediately started helping homeless youth in Phoenix. She has also served in the Arizona Legislature and is currently the Secretary of State for Arizona. Many of her plans and accomplishments center around bringing accountability to political offices and creating solutions for the real and everyday problems Arizonans face. It is clear Hobbs has a lot to offer Arizonans. Having worked with Arizona families so much in her life, she knows what the average person needs in their everyday routines. As the nominee for the Democratic Party, she has plenty of ideas for how to shape Arizona from the office of the governor. Most of the strength of her platform revolves around combating real social issues that have become problems over the last few years. One of the problems she plans to address is abortion access and care. Coming from a social work background, she understands the consequences anunplanned pregnancycan have on women and their families. Since Roe v. Wade wasoverturned, Hobbs said she plans to secure the freedom of choice in Arizona, tackling Republican-made laws within the state that attempt to limit this form of health care. She also plans to expand access to family planning resources and other reproductive care within the state. Hobbs also is active in addressing equity and justice and is aiming for an inclusive government that works for all, something else that has become relevant within the past few years. Hobbs plans to recruit and hire women and people fromunderrepresented communitiesto ensure all Arizonans are heard under her administration. At the state level, she plans to create the roles of chief equity officer and civil rights policy advisor. These positions will hold Arizona accountable in promoting diversity within the workforce. To address the wage gap, Hobbs would like to publicly audit statewide employee salaries to reveal the pay inequalities that exist. She also would like to invest in minority-owned businesses, expand access to capital for these businesses and expand diversity within the STEM field. Further issues to be addressed include access to the ballot for communities of color, addressing racial disparities in the criminal justice system andstrengthening equal rightsby banning LGBTQ+ discrimination in multiple areas. These are only a few of the issues Hobbs would address as governor of Arizona, all of which are of vast importance. Not only does she have plans for these issues, but she has firsthand experience in government and social work and knows what it takes to deliver for Arizonans. Her campaign website is also easy to navigate and is very detailed regarding what her plans are for the state – transparency and accessibility that is encouraging to a potential voter. While these ideas may be appealing to certain audiences, others may not be impressed with them. Being informed on multiple issues about different candidates is essential when it comes to voting. Debates are an easy way to compare candidates and see them express how their ideas and plans will work, while also being challenged by the other side. However, Hobbs hasrefusedmultiple times to debate Republican candidate Lake. RELATED:OPINION: Out-of-state students should vote in their home state Hobbs said she believes that a debate with Lake would only give the Republican candidate a chance to create a performance like that of the Republican primary debate. Hobbsalso addedthat one “can’t debate a conspiracy theorist,” and that Lake would mention past elections during the debate. While Hobbs has valid reasons for declining a debate with Lake, it does limit the scope of her campaign. Swing voters may be less apt to vote for someone who refuses to take part in any bipartisan discourse at this level. Kari Lake (R A former broadcast journalist and news anchor for Phoenix television station KSAZ-TV, Kari Lake is running for Arizona governor as part of the Republican Party. She graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree in communications and journalism. Lake states on her official campaign website that she is pro-life, anti-vaccine and in support of securing the Mexico–United States border with a wall. Lake takes a strong stance on some of the most topical issues voters will be met with at the polls and follows former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey in many of her beliefs and policies. Perhaps one of the most controversial candidates gracing the Arizona ballot this November, Lake has drawn attention to herself across the state for her aggressive policy ideas and public persona. Lake isvocalabout her belief that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump, and it is one of the founding components of her campaign. This position is not a new one for far-right Republican candidates across the U.S. Yet, in a state that will hold immense sway in the 2024 presidential election, Lake’s 2020 election denial could help shoot far-right Republican policy to the forefront of American politics should she secure the job as Arizona’s governor. The Republican gubernatorial candidate also has expressed strong opinions regarding water usage and abortion in Arizona, two issues that voters will have in mind at the polls. Lake says on her website that water availability in Arizona and the Southwest as a whole is – and will continue to be – an enormous problem residents face. However, there is an element of this discussion that Lake does not address, and that is climate change. Lakeadvocatesfor desalination and pumping water from outside the state, as well as expanding existing dams and reservoirs to better utilize storm runoff. Noticeably absent from her water policy is a discussion on climate change, an issue that is especially important in a state already struggling withextreme heat and drought. Arizonans should also note Lake’s views on abortion, one of the most important issues guiding voters at the polls this year. On her campaign website, Lake states that she ispro-life. While Lake has not come down quite as hard on the issue as some other Trump-endorsed Republican candidates, she stated in an interview with “Face The Nation” yesterday that she wants, “to give women true choices. I will uphold the law, whatever that law is.” Current Arizona law surrounding abortion is confusing for many, especially after an appeals court ruledon Fridayto halt the enforcement of a pre-statehood law that would criminalize abortions regardless of circumstance. Regardless of pre-statehood laws, Lake is still in the anti-abortion camp and will continue to be should she take office as Arizona’s governor. With somany votersviewing abortion rights as an important issue, Lake’s pro-life stance is vital to know. Lake’s increasingly radical viewpoints on Arizona issues mirror many far-right, Trump-endorsed Republicans on ballots across the U.S. Where Lake diverges from her predecessors is in the area of creating new and exciting issues for Arizonans to consider, the titular issue being what she calls, “Cancel Culture & Censorship.” It seems as though 22 years in front of the camera has made Lake a bit wary of cancel culture pushed by those who are, as she says, “mentally unbalanced.” She said she plansto cut shared state revenue, grants and morefrom schools that intentionally supress free speech that is not within the realm of inciting violence – a definition that is vague at best. This goes for businesses too, whereLake claimsshe will pull eligibility for tax breaks for businesses that “engage in cancel culture.” This insistence on protecting free speech does not seem to extend to people who claim the 2020 election was not, in fact, stolen. Lake is a candidate who is more preoccupied with her own image and rise to power than she is with Arizona residents’ well-being. To elect Lake would mean skyrocketing a woman to one of the most influential positions in Arizona government who has no concrete political experience and instead relies on a disgraced former president’s endorsement, punchy language and flashy TV appearances. It’s time for change Time and time again, we have been told that it is our responsibility to vote in the candidates that will better our future. And, as much as this request has been exhausted, it is true. There is no reason to be indifferent about social and political reform when it affects us on a daily basis, both short-term and long-term. Some say politics has no effect on them, but no matter how dirty it can all get, the choices that powerful people make determine our freedoms and, more importantly, the freedoms of the people we may not even know who are much less fortunate than ourselves. When it comes to the office of the governor for Arizona, there are many ideas to consider. One’s background, social ideas and future plans can determine how far a candidate may go in an election. Exercising the fundamental right to vote in this election can be a first step for anyone looking for a way to make a change in Arizona. We shouldn’t have to keep protesting for our basic human rights, and if we put the right people in office, there eventually will be no need for movements likeRed for EdorMarch for Our Lives, because the state will be a safer place for everyone and not just for the politicians dictating our futures. With Ducey leaving office after eight consecutive years, now is our chance to elect an official that is truly inclusive and demonstrates empathy without having to make accusatory claims. With this assessment in mind, make the logical choice. There is evidently one candidate who puts the Arizonan people first and stays true to her values in reform proposals and in action. Don’t drown in the Republican fantasy world of Lake; instead, vote blue on Nov. 8. Follow theDaily WildcatonTwitter"
crimson_2022_95,"“I see you have adjusted well and picked up their language.” I let out a slight chuckle, struggling to find words to fill the awkward silence that engulfed the Zoom call. I had not realized that I was overemphasizing my r’s and my medial t’s to sound like d’s, but her comments reeled me back in. My aunt is happy to talk to me, but she is not pleased by the American accent I am picking up. I promised her, and myself, that I would not adopt an American accent. However, here I was on this call, pitching my voice higher, tilting my a’s and t’s, and quickly gliding over my vowels. If I did not have to, I wouldn’t change my accent. It is a habit I have picked up to be able to make conversation — few people can understand what I say and even fewer have the courage to ask me to repeat what I have said. Not many people have the bandwidth for the discomfort that comes with asking me to say something again, so they find it easier to go with neutral conversation fillers. Just to hurry things up and end the conversation. I get it. For most of my schoolmates, it is their first time interacting with someone from Kenya. I understand that it is difficult for most of them to make out what I am saying. I am aware that it is not their fault that they can’t easily comprehend what I say in my accent. If anything, had I not grown up consuming so much American media, I probably wouldn’t understand what Americans say, either. However, this does not stop me from feeling a little bit of resentment. Resentment because while I am putting in the effort to understand others, they do not seem to be putting in the effort to understand me. I feel resentful because my accent prevents me from fully participating in class, resentful that people fail to acknowledge my contributions during class discussions, not because my contributions are wrong, but because of my accent. I feel resentful because British and Australian accents do not seem to be a challenge for my peers, but my Kenyan accent — the one that goes through all the vowels, enunciating everything clearly — is difficult to decipher. I feel resentful because I know if people took the time to listen to me — if people were willing to listen to me — then my accent would not be such an issue. Although I struggle to sound American, I fear I will pick up an American accent at the expense of my Kenyan one. It often crosses my mind that perhaps at some point I will not be able to code-switch; I will have a full-on American accent and there will be no traces of my Kenyan accent left. That there will be one less thing that helps me identify with my country, and that perhaps after a few years, I will go back to Kenya and be considered a foreigner in the place I call home. That my hard r’s and softened t’s will reek of Westernization. Despite all this, I take delight in having an accent. It is an identity; that thousands of miles away from home fellow Kenyans can spot me on the T or even the subway in New York. The conversations with my Kenyan friends, our deepened vowels, stressed medial t’s, and soft r’s, are a piece of home that I have here with me. Most importantly, having an accent has made me a better listener. Having to put in extra effort to make my point has made it easier to put in the effort to understand others’ points. It has made me realize that I did not often listen actively to what others said. Now, I listen to understand, not merely to respond. I hope that I will learn the American accent. It will make flirting at parties much easier and will give me back my sense of humor. I also hope that I will not lose my Kenyan accent; that I will be able to revert back to it when I need it. I hope once I land at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, I will fit right back in; that the place I call home will not think of me as foreign.

stanforddaily_2022_51,"At the end of my freshman year at Stanford University, I had the audacity to think it was a good idea to ask out a boy. Probably because my whole life, people have been telling me how wonderful I am. I was my grandparents’ first grandchild, a precocious little girl with a pair of lungs that would give DJ Khaled a run for his money. In elementary school, I was writing my first several novels (and plays that I acted out for my family in the living room . I was then accepted into a prestigious middle school that you had to test into, I went to the same high school that Timothee Chalamet and Nicki Minaj went to and I got into Stanford Fucking University. So I’m not saying I went into Stanford thinking I was hot shit … but I went into Stanford thinking I was hot shit. My first reality check came when I walked into my first class on the first day, and found out that economics isn’t just the study of how to do taxes (which might seem like common knowledge to you but was a harsh realization for me . But then somehow freshman year just turned into a series of revelations that I’m NoT aS sPeCiAl As My MoM tOlD mE i WaS. For example: And I know it might seem like I’m making light of all these failures (probably because I when I’m upset I deflectttt it with humorrrr , but after a while, the waterworks and phone calls home became a not infrequent occurrence. But although Stanford had taken a lot of things from me — my scholastic aptitude, my talent for acting, my ability to present well in my resumé and in my academic writing — there was one thing Stanford had left untouched: my appearance. Although I felt like an incompetent, untalented dimwit, at least I still felt like ahotincompetent, untalented dimwit. Because I felt this way, I decided that I had nothing to lose in asking out a cute boy from one of my classes. He was unlike all of the boys I had ever dated before — smart, literate, decent — and although he was a little nerdier-looking than the boys I would normally go for, under those thick-brimmed glasses lay a very conventionally handsome face. So one day, I waited for him after class (which happened to be the one day where instead of jetting out of the building and back to his dorm, he stayed behind to talk to the professor just so that in waiting outside for him I would look ~that much creepier~ , and asked if I could talk to him for a moment. (One of the really lucky things I got to experience that day was what it would feel like to have a heart attack. In the moments before he emerged from the building, my heart was beating so fast that I feared it would be visible through my clothes, and sweat was pooling up all hither and thither. The boy said yes, and honestly, I had been so worried about how exactly I should phrase the question, and exactly how long the pause would be before he gave an answer, and what the answer would even be, that I had completely neglected to imagine what it would be like if he said yes. But he did, and then there was a long pause because I hadn’t prepared what to say next … and then he goes, “so … should we exchange numbers?” So we exchanged numbers, and eventually we decided on a time and place. But when I received a text message that day asking to postpone, and as that day (and many others came and went, it became evident that all the time I had devoted to researching the “top ten most breathtaking wedding destinations” … might have been a little premature. From then on, I became hypersensitive to the way he and I did not interact in class, and how he continued to book it out of the building after every lesson. And I began to feel so stupid — how could I have been naive enough to build up this love story in my head when it was clearly totally one-sided? But then I realized that perhaps fathoming that a boy I was interested in might not be interested in me … wasn’t all that crazy. In a world of 8 billion people, it was always going to be a 50/50 toss-upthat he would be the type of person capable of appreciating my devastating beauty or the type of person who is blind. Over the past four years, I have wrestled with this concept of self-worth. As Stanford students, I think many of us have grown up accustomed to external validation — whether those be grades, or awards, or college admissions. There is so much temptation to view our self-worth through the lens of these accolades. But when I think about the incredible people I’ve met at Stanford — my best friends — none of this factors into what make them impressive to me. Rather, my best friends are kind, they’re compassionate, they’re funny, dependable, courageous and resilient. It just so happens that they can also speak a million languages and hack into the mainframe and all that. I’m a senior now, and what I’ve learned from my time at Stanford is this: we mustn’t feel that we are entitled to anything — to admission into a club, to a good grade, to a boy. For not only does entitlement lead us to calamity when things don’t go our way, but it also encourages us not to work hard for things. While being able to appreciate our strengths leads us to be the self-assured, confident individuals that Stanford admissions officers seek to admit, ignoring our imperfection makes us ill fit to handle the real world, where people aren’t always going to see us the way our moms do.

state_press_2022_8,"Unpaid internships take advantage of college students and there needs to be a change in the way companies conduct internship programs. College students throughout the nation flock to find internships. Whether that s because it s an ASU program requirement to have internship credit to graduate, or the students want hands-on experience that will help improve their resume, internships are a great way for college-aged students to prepare for employment. However, unpaid internships take advantage of college students and there needs to be a change in the way companies conduct internship programs. Internships require a lot of work, whether that means going out in the field, working in an office or lab space or working remotely. Most importantly, an internship is a job, and that is why interns need to be paid for the work they do. No one likes to do work for free, and interns are no exception. In dealing with these circumstances, companies that pay their interns report they are more likely to be happy in their positions than their peers working in unpaid intern roles. Happier, higher-quality interns produce better work, according toParker Dewey, a website that allows college students and recent graduates to find micro-internships. This information shows interns are more likely to produce quality work when they are getting paid for their work, rather than just gaining experience and working for free. When people are happy and motivated in their work environment, it allows people to enhance their work, no matter what their task is, and make the most of their time interning. Delaney Field has an unpaid internship through ASU. She trims videos of governors from during the height of the pandemic. The videos are then run through a transcription service to be rated on their charisma. I also am OK with being paid because it is making advancements in research through my internship which can better the lives of not only society but also the people directly influenced by politics, said Field, a biomedical science student. This raises the question of whether internship programs that do not pay their interns are exploiting their interns. The simple answer is yes. They are not receiving financial compensation for the work they are doing, just the experience of working in a profession they hope to pursue after graduation. Sometimes I do push it to the back-burner just because I don t feel like it s necessarily a top priority because I m not getting direct benefits from it right away but overall I feel like it was still a good opportunity, Field said. The Department of Labor has rules set in place regarding the issue of unpaid work; however, it is up to the company hosting the internship to find the loopholes in these rules, depending on the circumstances. According to theDepartment of Labor, courts have described the primary beneficiary test as a flexible test, and no single factor is determinative. Accordingly, whether an intern or student is an employee under theFair Labor Standards Actnecessarily depends on the unique circumstances of each case. ASUdoes an excellent job of listing what the requirements are for an internship in regards to class preparation and what needs to be submitted to the outlet that you are applying to. The University also lists the number of hours linked to credits for the internship. Not only can it be draining, but students who have to pay for their own tuition and other school needs such as rent lean on jobs throughout the year and when a student essentially has to managetwo jobs, with one being for pay and the other receiving no pay, it is a huge task to conquer. ASU can be that difference maker by requiring their students to only accept an internship for credit if it is paid. This way forces students to seek paid opportunities to put themselves in a position to succeed. Reach the columnist atalkalmba@asu.eduand follow@adokalm32on Twitter.

stanforddaily_2022_121,"Several months ago, I wrotea pieceadvocating for Stanford’s adoption of a hate speech code into its Fundamental Standard to prevent discriminatory verbal harassment on campus. In short, I argued that it would be legal and desirable for Stanford to re-introduce the Grey Interpretation, which interpreted the Fundamental Standard to impose consequences for hate speech. Nicholas Welch, in hisresponseto my piece, argues that my faith in a reinvigorated hate speech code is “dangerously naïve.” Welch’s reply proceeds to misstate most of the arguments in my original speech, and for the arguments he does quote accurately, relies on hyperbole and strawman as a substitute for serious engagement. Welch’s first claim is that reintroducing a hate speech code would do nothing to prevent future instances of discriminatory harassment because of the unique characteristics of the Vinci incident. But hate speech on Stanford’s campus is not an isolated incident, as Welch seems to suggest. In 2017, Stanford College RepublicansinvitedRobert Spencer to give a campus speech. Spencer is designated as an extremist by theSouthern Poverty Law Center, which describes him as “one of America’s most prolific and vociferous anti-Muslim propagandists.” In 2019, moreover, residents of Casa Zapata wrote to theDailyprotesting the behavior of the SCR, who physically intimidated residents while attempting to forcibly enter Zapata after Zapata restricted visitors to prevent racialized, hateful graffiti. While Vinci may have suffered from a “severe mental health crisis,” that does not excuse his behavior, absolve him from the need for accountability or decouple him from the organization he identified with and whose values he merely took to the extreme. Hence the need for more stringent regulations on campus to prevent future instances of similar hate speech. Next, Welch asks us to consider the nature of “identity” and how it could be applied to a revitalized hate speech code. Does Welch seriously believe that because there are “an infinite number of nontrivial ways to categorize identity characteristics,” we should simply give up on protecting marginalized groups from violence and discrimination? Welch’s complaint about “dumb blond” jokes reads like it came straight from a Turning Point USA Twitter rant. Welch is correct that, in the interest of space and reader engagement, my previous piece did not copy and paste the entire text of the Grey Interpretation of the Fundamental Standard (for those interested in reading it in its entirety, it can be foundhere . My paraphrasal, however, does not mean that the Grey Interpretation’s list of identity categories is arbitrary, as Welch seems to imply when he suggests hair color and height as two potential additions. Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orientation and national and ethnic origin in particular is unique because, unlike hair color and height, this type of discrimination is pervasive and societal, seriously affecting individuals’ mental health and life chances. That discrimination also often occurs in conjunction with physical abuse. Thus, Stanford should take special steps to prevent such harassment. Unless Welch is seriously comparing “dumb blond” jokes or assumptions about his basketball ability to persistent inequality and violence, it seems obvious that we can determine which forms of discrimination pose a serious threat to members of the Stanford community and respond to that discrimination accordingly (side note: as a ginger who is also 6’2”, I can confirm that none of the challenges Welch mentions are intolerable . Welch next argues that “centralized administrations are not to be trusted with speech-regulating powers.” Again, Welch misses the point of my article. I am not advocating for Stanford to codify its support for one “social cause.” Instead, I am arguing that Stanford should protect the basic human dignity of its students. An anti-harassment provision would ensure that Stanford students could debate the merits of various social causes without being subjected to identity-based discrimination, which, as I noted, contravenes the goal of peaceful dialogue by “targeting individuals on the basis of their identity, not their ideas.” Welch’s point merely demonstrates the importance of anti-harassment provisions on college campuses. Identity-based harassment shuts down the productive dialogue that Stanford should be fostering. Such demands for free speech are also often used as a false flag to shut down legitimate criticism of violent speech. Concern about First Amendment rights shifts the narrative away from discriminatory behavior and allows individuals like Welch to cast themselves as the real victims. Take, for example, SCR’s 2019 reaction to Casa Zapata’s visitor policy. Although the Zapata residents implemented more stringent visitor requirements to prevent hateful graffiti, SCR members sought to victimize themselves by demanding access to the building on the basis of free speech, while disregarding the concerns of the residents themselves. Welch’s plaintive account of the dumb blond jokes he’s experienced mirrors this pattern of distraction and denial. Welch raises concerns about the psychologically taxing nature of the formal investigations that might result from Stanford’s reinstatement of a hate speech code. Applied to any other situation, Welch’s concern is clearly preposterous. Should murder investigations be halted because of the stress that is placed on the potential murderer? Should Stanford refuse to investigate sexual assault allegations to protect the assaulter from undue psychological strain? Why, then, should hate speech investigations be any different? As I noted, while investigations may be taxing,studies confirmthat hate speech is also “particularly psychologically damaging” on college campuses. Allowing this psychological harm to continue in the name of the perpetrators’ mental wellbeing defies justice. Welch’s answer might be that restrictions on speech are different because they encourage “self-censorship.” Yet this concern lacks specificity. What would “self-censorship” look like? To the extent that privileged students might be incentivized to think twice before saying something potentially hateful, I see this as a positive. Welch’s next complaint once again illustrates his misguided understanding of my previous piece. The firing of Emmanual Cafferty and the suspension of USC Professor Greg Patton were unfortunate. Every code will occasionally be misapplied. But it would be wrong to dismiss all anti-hate speech efforts because of an anecdotal handful of wrongful terminations. Welch’s concern merely indicates the need for a precisely-written hate speech code, of which the Grey Interpretation did an exemplary job, as I noted in my previous piece. Finally, Welch takes issue with my description of the student body’s frustration with Stanford’s lack of transparency during the Vinci incident. Once more, Welch misconstrues my article. Privacy is an important right for all defendants, and a factual statement intended to provide context for a recent controversy in no way indicates my opposition to due process. Yet this final complaint illustrates the fundamental mismatch between Welch’s sensationalist vision of a reinvigorated hate speech code and the Grey Interpretation’s reality. Welch’s depiction of students being expelled willy-nilly mere hours after an allegation is lodged against them is scary, but it is also not a system for which I am advocating. Every student deserves a fair, thorough investigation of any harassment they are accused of committing. And if that investigation finds that a student is guilty of hate speech, that student should face real consequences. Any other policy ensures Stanford will remain an unsafe space unable to fulfill its educational mission. Will Halverson ’25 is an opinions writer at the Stanford Daily.

crimson_2022_83,"I was first introduced to the Harvard Undergraduate Council at a Virtual Visitas information session last year. I was an energetic high school senior at the time, ready for a new beginning and eager to get involved in the Harvard community. I had already decided that I would not run for a position and would just attend the session to listen in — I served on student council in high school and thought it was time to explore different activities and aspects of student life. But, as I watched UC members talk about truly important issues, I gained a deep interest in and respect for the organization. I learned about a UC campaign thatraised thousands of dollarsfor anti-racism initiatives in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. Statementscalling forHarvard’s fossil fuel divestment andcondemninghuman rights violations in India. Subsidy programs that make college lifea bit more affordableand grants that allow student groups to plan events and bring Harvard together. It seemed to be a highly effective and meaningful vehicle for change; a platform for advocacy and crucial discourse about the student experience. I believed it was student organizing at its best and wanted to be a part of it — that is until I was elected as a representative and attended my first meetings. I quickly realized that I had been thrusted into an incredibly tense and divided institution with deep cutting political — and personal — history that I knew nothing about. At one of our first meetings, a heated debate over a proposed budget revealed what would define my time on the Council: an intense power struggle between various factions that essentially ruled out any form of collaboration from the start. You could feel it in the room: the stares, the side conversations, the passive aggressive — and sometimes just aggressive — speeches. First-years were looked at only as votes, meant to be won over with promises of power and prestige in exchange for unconditional loyalty. It was a harmful and purely unproductive environment dressed in formalities to appear functional. I remember walking into a team dinner early on in the term and having to choose between two tables, each occupied by a different clique. I delicately swayed from one to the other, hoping not to get caught up in any drama. That was exactly my approach going into the term: to act as a connector, a facilitator. To try and push the agenda along by encouraging dialogue and communicating across groups. To be on no side but yours. And that was my approach heading into a contentious UC presidential election last semester. I had been told about potential campaign rules violations and started working with a team of Council members to protect the integrity and fairness of the elections process. But, as election day approached, it became clear that election fairness was not the only goal in mind for some around me. You see, UC politics are a poison — but an addictive one. Every meeting boasts something new to strategize about and fight over. It’s fast-paced and closely watched by the student body. That kind of attention can easily distract from real work if taken the wrong way. Amidst all the Crimson articles and angry Slack messages, it’s easy to lose sight of why the UC exists in the first place: to give students a voice in Harvard’s leadership and a say in its direction. As those around me set their sights less on that truth and more on the presidency, I too felt myself slipping away from you and the values I promised I would hold dear. And that is why I’m resigning: the UC brought out the worst in me. As soon as I started looking at other members of the Council as political opponents instead of fellow students, I knew that I had lost touch with what I care about and had to step away. The current administration is right: the Undergraduate Council is broken and needs to be reimagined. But the problem isn’t an overly long constitution: it’s the toxic culture that pins students against one another — a culture its leadership has only reinforced with divisive and inflammatory rhetoric. The UC has accomplished so much before and can be something great; the way to fix it is not to point fingers, but to refocus on what matters. To engage all UC members and students in the decision-making process. To knock on doors and set up tables to hear from people around campus. To embrace change and look forward. We, the student body, must show up to Council meetings and participate in the upcoming constitutional referendum, use UC resources and influence to advocate for progress and reclaim it as an open student forum. It can no longer be an exclusive and disconnected club for a select few. So, while I won’t be casting votes as a representative any longer, you’ll still find me in the Smith Center on Sundays participating in the democratic process and holding those who represent us accountable. Join me. Owen O. Ebose ’25 is a first-year College student in Greenough Hall."
wildcat_arizona_2022_52,"University of Arizona head football coach Jedd Fisch watches his players as they run a play at Arizona Stadium on April 9, 2022. Fisch is entering his second year as head coach of the Wildcats. It has been over a year since Arizona’s football program has changed and the future looks brighter. When Jedd Fisch came to Tucson in 2021, he had one message to his group: IT’S PERSONAL. That message is a lot deeper than its typical meaning. The Wildcats only won one game last season, but that doesn’t tell the full story. Improvement was shown each week and, in every game, even in embarrassing losing efforts against University of Colorado Boulder and NAU. Fisch had a tremendous offseason, where he had Arizona’s 2022 recruiting class ranked inside the top-25 in the country according to 247sports. That included Arizona’s best single prospect in program history, Tetairoa McMillan who is a very talented wide receiver. This was also Arizona’s best recruiting class since 2006. Behind the top recruit class and improvement throughout the overall roster including two new quarterbacks, the energy and vibe around the team is just different this time around. There is more of an intensity because now it is serious, and the coaches and veteran players that remain know that they have to be game ready all the time. When Fisch arrived in Tucson, he knew it was going to be a journey and that things might not change overnight but that the program will be moving in the right direction for the future. Before the 2021 season, sportsbooks had Arizona at an over/under of 2.5 games. Most analysts and those covering the sport thought the Wildcats would win one or two games. A season later and that win total has been raised by one game and is at 3.5 games. But this time, more people think they will go over the projected 3.5 games. Arizona just had a player named to the preseason All-American team with starting kicker, Kyle Ostendorp. Fisch is a very positive motivator and the exact person that this program has needed for many years. Even after losses last season, Fisch would always look for the positives and try to keep his team on the right track. There is more change on the horizon with a possible move to the Big-12 in the coming years. After UCLA and USC made a deal to move to the Big-Ten conference in 2024, rumors for the remaining Pac-12 schools future home began. Arizona has made itself a school that will be valuable for other conferences when making additions. This is because of the position that Fisch has brought them to. He took a a depleted program that won four games the previous two seasons to a team currently that has a purpose and an excellent foundation for winning. Whether the Wildcats win seven games or four games this season, Arizona has finally got their head coach of the future. FollowRyan WohlonTwitter Ryan Wohl is the Sports Editor at theDaily Wildcat.

In anopen letterto Spotify in January, a coalition of 270 doctors and public health experts urged the music streaming platform to stop “enabling its hosted media to damage public trust in scientific research and sow doubt in the credibility of data-driven guidance.” Despite this, Spotify has taken no action to indicate that these claims are false — a dangerous choice considering Rogan’s podcast is Spotify’smost-streamedone, reaching11 millionpeople each month. In light of Spotify’s inaction, many musicians and podcast personalities have decided toremovetheir material from Spotify’s platform in protest. This movement was headlined by singer-songwriterNeil Young, who issued a statement demanding his music be removed from the platform, citing the platform’s part in undermining the fight against the virus. He claimed“They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” While drastic, Young’s demands were met. Within days of the release of Young’s letter, his entire discography was removed from the streaming platform. Soon after, singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell and Bruce Springsteen’s guitarist, Nils Lofgren, followed suit, requesting theirmusic be removedfor the same reasons. Doctors and public health experts had been pleading for the regulation of Rogan and his podcast sincelast April. Unfortunately, their words didn’t have the same result as Young’s action. Young’s decision to remove his music from Spotify not only led others to do the same, but it also created a nationwide conversation around the pressing issue that was not receiving adequate attention. The mass media attention surrounding this kind of misinformation and public pressure for Spotify to take action against it is encouraging. However, it’s concerning that when doctors and public health experts sent an open letter to the platform, there was little recognition from either Spotify or the media. The plea from doctors and public health officials, who have been on the front lines throughout the pandemic, should have elicited more response. Although Young and the others who recognized the failed response from Spotify should be applauded for using their fame to bring attention to the issue, it should not go without recognition of the pleas from the health officials who came before them. Since Young’s decision to remove his music became public, Spotify and Rogan have released respondingstatements.Rogan said that he would “try harder” to highlight people with differing viewpoints and work to make sure he has all the facts on an issue before discussing it. Spotify has announced that they plan to implement a content advisory to all podcast episodes that discuss COVID-19, similar to the warnings implemented months ago on Facebook and Instagram. If one thing has become concerningly clear over the last two years, it is that millions of people have a hard time believing doctors and health experts. The individuals who have gone through years of schooling in the fields of public health and medicine have been ignored over and over again. Additionally, for many who were at first skeptical of the pandemic, it only became real after actorTom Hanksshared on Instagram that he and his wife had contracted the virus themselves. While health care workers were pleading for help in the background, Americans chose to verify their public health information through public figures instead. Similarly, the threat of misinformation on Spotify was only fully recognized by the public when Young initiated a boycott. Health officials have done their best at warning and informing Americans of the risks of COVID-19, and they have been constantly disregarded and undermined by those forming and spreading their own opinions that contradict scientific evidence. Their voices must no longer be ignored. American’s must shift their focus away from celebrities to health experts on all matters of public health, no matter how well-meaning celebrity messages may seem.

The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Being Black in the United States is uncomfortable, often dangerous, and the bubble of a college campus doesn’t offer much protection. While Rice and many similar institutions tout their extensive diversity and inclusion efforts, these institutions often fail at supporting Black students. Theracist anti-Black emails sent to Black students at the University of Massachusetts Amherstseveral months ago is a prime example of an institution’s failure to combat bigotry. Although Rice hasn’t had an incident as extreme as Amherst, Rice isn’t perfect. There are gaps in Rice’s efforts to accommodate Black students, so Rice should take initiative and do more to fill these gaps. While many diversity initiatives have been enacted to educate undergraduate students, similar initiatives are not visible at the faculty and staff level. From my observations and experiences at Rice, I believe that the current initiatives are not enough. Shortly before the fall semester began, the college coordinator of my residential college, Martel, emailed me about a parking dispute involving my vehicle. After I had failed to respond to her first email, she called RUPD. While the response seemed reasonable to the coordinator, it was anything but reasonable to me. I, having not seen the email, walked outside to see two RUPD cars surrounding my vehicle. I was petrified. Was I going to be arrested, or could something even worse occur? I tried my best to avoid thinking of all the grim police interactions with Black Americans in the last year, but I couldn’t help but wonder: what if they shoot me? For months following this incident, I was shocked. I didn’t think anything like this could happen at Rice; obviously, I was wrong. While I feel much safer on-campus than off-campus, this incident made me realize that I didn’t feel safe. My experience is just one example of why Rice needs to be more accommodating to Black students. College officials shouldn’t jump to the most extreme measures, such as calling RUPD, to handle student issues. These trusted adults should be educated on a variety of options to fix these problems while maintaining the trust of their students. Although calling RUPD was a quick solution to the college coordinator’s problem, the result was my emotional trauma. The quick solution wasn’t the best solution. The more I reflected, the more I realized that Rice’s support towards Black students was incomplete. At Martel, I noticed that there was an absence of Black students in leadership positions and committees. As both an O-Week Advisor and a committee head, I have often felt like the “token Black student,” since so few of us occupy these spaces. As a token Black student, I feel responsible for educating others for the sake of Black students at Rice. I also feel pressured to avoid mistakes or ask for help because doing so could make me “look bad,” which could negatively impact other Black students seeking leadership positions. This “token Black student” sentiment reappeared when Soul Night and Africaye watch parties happened at Martel last year. Both events were supposed to be hosted by Martel’s Diversity Council, for which I was shadowing. Since I was a shadow, I wasn’t actively involved in event planning, and my responsibilities involved attending meetings, volunteering when possible, and observing. Through my observations, I witnessed the planning, promotion, and execution of Soul Night and Africaye fall disproportionately on one Black Diversity Council member. Once again, it felt like a few Black students were forced to be perfect and to educate the wider campus population on Black issues. Of course, I don’t speak for all Black students, and my experience is one of many. Martel isn’t racist, but this phenomenon speaks to a larger issue at Rice: the university’s failure to fully accommodate Black students. The administration s hesitancy to remove the Willy statue, which is a reminder that Black students and other underrepresented minorities “didn’t belong” at Rice in the past, along with specific residential college experiences like mine, have disregarded Black students’ experiences. Rice should prioritize providing a safe and comfortable environment for all students, which includes Black students. We shouldn’t have to worry about the consequences of having the police called on us, or have to constantly confront racism. But unfortunately, we do. While Rice can’t abolish racism in the United States, the university can support Black students on campus by educating the community and taking action. While Critical Dialogues on Diversity is a step in the right direction, more can be done. Educate college core teams and faculty so situations like mine can be avoided. Take more concrete steps towards removing the Willy statue. Show us Black students that you are aware of our experiences and supportive. While we belong at Rice, we also want to feel safe and comfortable at Rice, because that’s what every student deserves. The Rice community has always preached the culture of care, but it’s time to extend the culture of care to be more supportive of Black students. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2022_47,"7:25 p.m. — I nervously checked the time on my computer, while wiping away the beads of sweat that had started to form on my forehead. I had been praying, nay, pleading, for the last 10 minutes — “Please let this interview go well.” I was on my last set of graduate school interviews. This was my last chance, I had been rejected everywhere else. I had no idea what I was doing wrong — the platitudes of “just be yourself” from my classmates rang hollow within me. I just internalized it — if “just be yourself” was not working, then something was definitely wrong with me. 7:29 p.m. — One minute to go. I took a final swig of water and thought to myself, ”If I ever find myself on the other side of the table, won’t I change a few things…” It has been two years since that fateful interview day. Although I am currently a graduate student here at Stanford, I still have no idea what happened and why I was admitted. But in those two years, the pressing need to figure out what went wrong with the other interviews never left me. “Why do you care, you are already at Stanford?” was the common reaction I got from my acquaintances whenever I brought it up. However, I do care — I care deeply. Not because of my ego, but because of the reason why I am in graduate school. I am training to become a better engineer and scientist. And the only way to become a better engineer and scientist is through feedback. As scientists, we receive feedback from every single situation — when we submit manuscripts, we receive feedback from the editors and peer reviewers. When we submit grants, we receive feedback from NSF and NIH panelists. When we defend or give our qualifying examinations, we get feedback from our committee members and those who listen to us. When we go up for tenure, we get feedback from the tenure committee. Every basic interaction between lab colleagues allows us to refine and change our ideas and methods. So why is it that admissions, perhaps the most critical part of one’s journey to becoming a scientist, has to be the most Kafkaesque process? Departments at Stanford have policies that they will not release feedback about their decisions to students. Let me again point out how asinine that is. As scientists, we strive for clarity, reproducibility and evidence — if there is no clear criteria for those who are admitted and those who are not, we are creating a game of chance, an unequal opportunity between those who understand the “game” and those who do not. For many of us who have been admitted, it is a case of survivorship bias; we may not care about what our interviewers thought — we got in. However, the reality is that there are hundreds of others who haven’t gotten in — there is about a 10% acceptance rate in my department. For many of them, who passed the initial screening and reached the interview stage, having that extra feedback from the professors who spent the time interacting with the applicant will go a long way in helping their futures in other grad school interviews, or in general become better at the interview process. By denying all of this, growth is stunted. In particular, this unduly affects groups who are less likely to understand the “game” — first-time higher education seekers, immigrants, people of color and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, as evidenced by the Department of Education’s ownreporton higher education statistics. Some may argue that people do not have time to respond to the potentially hundreds of applicants. However, federal grant agencies illustrate that it is possible to make the time; many national grant agencies, in particular NSF and NIH, return grant feedback to submitters. If federal grant agencies and reviewers can afford to spend time to give feedback, so can admissions committees. While departments may view giving feedback as an inefficient waste of time and resources, I would argue such feedback is valuable in the long term. Using the departments’ logic, growing a tree is a waste of time. It may be “inefficient” to take time out of our busy lives to water it, but over 50 years, when we are long gone, that tree will provide shade for those who didn’t have it before. We do not see the tree grow day to day, but if we do not water it daily, the tree will die before it has a chance to rise. In the same way, by not giving the applicants feedback, we are failing potential scientists. A perhaps darker interpretation can be taken that the lack of feedback and clarity is useful for maintaining a sense of “prestige” in the institution. It would be a lie to say that we don’t profit from this idea; a degree from Stanford opens up so many opportunities because of its exclusivity. Antonio Gramsci, an Italian 20th century political prisoner under Benito Mussolini, defined this as the idea ofcultural hegemony— the ruling class’s beliefs, thoughts and expectations become the dominant accepted cultural norm in a culturally diverse society. We are lucky that we have the choice to not perpetuate this hegemony; let us use this to enact change. It is easy to enact policies at the top of the chain to promote better representation; the real challenge starts at the roots so that more trees have a chance to grow. We have to rethink how graduate school admissions works, and really provide equitable opportunities. So, it is important for us to take this issue up with our departments here. For the small number of us currently in the program, we will not see any benefit from it, but I guarantee you, thousands will thank us for it.

thetech_mit_2022_49,"On March 9, an email went out to those who have filled a prescription at the MIT Pharmacy (located inside the MIT Medical building in the past year. This email announced that the pharmacy will close on April 29. It also stated that “no new prescriptions will be accepted at the MIT Pharmacy after March 25,” and that “existing refills will be processed until April 8.” In addition, the reduced prescription copayment rates offered by the MIT Pharmacy will only continue at other in-network pharmacies until Dec. 31, 2022. This decision, which will negatively impact staff, students, faculty, and other MIT affiliates, was made without adequate input from the MIT community at large. The emaillinks to an FAQ pageon the MIT Medical website. It lists the reason for the closure as a reduced customer base during the pandemic due to hybrid schedules and an increase in use of alternatives, including mail order and same-day delivery services for prescriptions. This does not take into account that hybrid work schedules for staff are not guaranteed to be permanent. After only one semester of hybrid schedules in Fall 2021, followed by an Independent Activities Period in January 2022 during which institute administrators encouraged staff to work from home as much as possible, closing the pharmacy because of hybrid schedules is not justified. It is not known how much longer hybrid work will continue, and essential staff as well as students, retirees, and others who are not on this kind of schedule were not even considered. The pharmacy staff themselves were informed of the closing only the night before this email went out. These staff members were not consulted at all during the actual decision-making process. A pharmacy staff member at MIT Medical who wished to remain anonymous said this about the pharmacy’s closing: “There are no Pharmacy people, for lack of a better term, in MIT Medical management and decisions about how to run the pharmacy and ultimately to close it and how to close it, were made without our input. As a result of the rush of it all there are, unsurprisingly, a lot of unexpected problems presenting themselves to management. The Pharmacy, as the place drugs are received and distributed through Medical, provides a lot of connective tissue that is being removed and replaced with two pharmacist positions yet to be filled or trained. It is unclear if they intend to hire any extant Pharmacists from here, not that how they have treated folks here engenders a lot of trust. Morale in Medical in general seems very bad, with people wondering who is going next. It is very hard to work for some folks who are willing to mislead you while setting up to get rid of you…. It feels pretty bad. There has been a huge outpouring of support from our patients, and we deeply appreciate it…. It is nice to know you made a difference and MIT Pharmacy itself was one of the best, most wholesome places I have ever worked. It feels like…Medical leadership was handed a beautiful antique watch and, rather than learn how it works and how to maintain it, banged it against the desk a few times and, fundamentally incurious, tossed it away.” The news of the closure was slow to trickle through the wider MIT community, as some staff who use the MIT Pharmacy regularly did not even receive the initial announcement. As the news did start to circulate, many staff members, ourselves included, were shocked to hear about the abrupt announcement, the treatment of the pharmacy staff, and the loss of easy access to a pharmacy just as more people are expected to return to campus. Concerned staff members wondered why the broader MIT community was not consulted and if there was a way to stop the closure on such a tight timeline, pointing to the still-in-developmentMIT Values Statementthat declares a commitment to collaboration, transparency, and trust in each other as pathways to solve problems. Questions around the closure also brought to light additional issues about how the decision was made and who had a say in the process. Neither pharmacy staff nor pharmacy customers were asked for feedback. The decision came down as final without much communication or clarity about why the community who uses this campus resource was not made aware that a closure was even under consideration, much less imminent. MIT has a wealth of eager community members ready to solve major community problems. The sheer number of task forces, committees, working groups, and employee resource groups on department, lab, center, school, and institute-wide levels testify to a deep commitment to preserving what makes MIT so exceptional and making it an even better place to study, research, live, and work. The closure of an on-site pharmacy may initially seem minor when there are retail pharmacies to be found on every corner (though still not in Kendall Square , but it does prompt the question of: What’s next? What will be the next convenience, perk, benefit, or job to be abruptly ended?

crimson_2022_169,"While doomscrolling through Instagram, I often come across a kind of post that really bothers me. Sometimes found on the accounts of people I otherwise admire and whose work I deeply appreciate is the quote “There’s no ethical consumption under capitalism,” followed by the activist’s personal rendition of an argument that goes something like: “Screw ‘ethical consumption.’ It’s an elitist and self-righteous practice that intentionally excludes the working class.” Typically, they then conclude by saying that we’d be much better off focusing our energy elsewhere. Don’t get me wrong: It isn’t lost on me why someone would believe this. Corporations often try to shift the blame for climate change and their other capitalist excesses on individuals, asking that we do our part to mitigate these issues when the blame, by and large, lies at their feet. The argument for conscious consumption also calls for a sense of individual responsibility, an idea haunted (on the left, anyway by the specter of neoliberalism. The developed arguments behind the posts probably aren’t too bad, either: Those opposed to the practice often say that “ethical consumers” are mistaken in thinking they make a difference. For example, realistically speaking, individual veganism does nothing to reduce the effects of factory farming on climate change. So these critics argue that the money and energy used on conscious consumption would hence be better spent on donating to environmental organizations and lobbying for comprehensive policy change. There’s no gotcha here. The numbers all add up. Still, I find myself reluctant to say that conscious consumption doesn’t matter. We can separate the motivations behind conscious consumption into two camps: a desire to promote sustainability and a desire to align consumption with morality. I think the argument outlined above places far too much weight on the first motivation while discarding the second as sanctimony. But I feel that conscious consumption is far more about doing the right thing than it is about effecting change. Much as themajorityof vegans are vegan because they believe in animal rights, I choose to boycott Amazon, among other corporate juntas, because I refuse to support its repugnant labor practices. I suffer no false pretenses that my decision to abstain from Amazon is substantially impacting its revenue, whichincreased dramaticallyover the course of the pandemic. In other words, both the vegans and I know that our decisions aren’t changing anything: we choose conscious consumption because we believe that to choose otherwise would be wrong. Moreover, I think the idea that conscious consumption is a luxury that low-income people cannot afford feels strawman-ish at best and very misguided at worst. The argument for conscious consumption is not that someone should place themselves in debt or make otherwise poor financial decisions to comply with its tenets; calls for conscious consumption — at least the ones from people with a brain and heart — are clearly directed towards people who have the ability to choose how they consume in the first place. It also seems to me that posts like these misunderstand good faith calls for conscious consumption. Laden in them is the idea that conscious consumption is about asserting your moral superiority and feeling good about yourself, maybe even absolving some of your capitalist guilt along the way. By this view, the quintessential conscious consumer is the corner-office girlboss who swipes her platinum Amex for some sustainably sourced Bonsai fertilizer with one hand and types up her latest Boston Consulting Group memo with the other. What this caricature misses is that conscious consumption is a moral framework about making the most conscious and informed decision that you feasibly can and is informed by the same moral commitments that presumably guide every other facet of your life. So while the desire to consume consciously might lead someone to make certain his flowers are farm-to-coffee table, it would also demand that he abstain, whenever possible, from purchasing water from companies that colonize Indigenous springs. Really, here lies the problem: in their supposed concern for the lower class, these posts legitimize their abuse. Its sweeping claim that conscious consumption is a worthless endeavor flies in the face of the truth that any other kind of consumption relies on and reinforces the mistreatment of oppressed people. So, while it is true that we need large-scale societal change, the anti-“ethical consumption crowd completely dismisses commitment to one’s ethical values — and chief among mine is a dedication to the marginalized. I’ve seen some people on Twitter suggest that we should replace “There’s no ethical consumption under capitalism,” as much as it continues to ring true, with Theodor Adorno’s “Wrong life cannot be lived rightly.” Wrong as Adorno was about many things, this strikes me as the right position today. The point here isn’t that worries about the impact of consumption are irrelevant, as many a Shein hauler on TikTok would have us believe, but that consumption as it currently exists is definitionally bound up with exploitation. Sometimes we don’t have any good choices, but that doesn’t take away from our responsibility to live the least wrong life we can. Even in our twisted consumptive landscape, we can choose to pay people more for their time and to make the effort to engage in as little exploitation as we can. And maybe these concerns are self-righteous; maybe it doesn’t matter whether we take advantage of people’s suffering if they’ll suffer anyway. Then again, I’d rather be self-righteous than willingly do wrong. Joel Sabando ’24, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a joint Comparative Literature and Math concentrator in Lowell House."
ubyssey_2022_23,"May 30, 2022 Written byStephanie Okoli Hip-hop is slowly dying and we are watching it unfold right before our eyes. I noticed the genre s death when I saw the music video for Nicki Minaj and Fivio Foreign s new song,We Go Up. I watched Nicki sit in luxury cars, lounge around Louis Vuitton bags and change from outfit to outfit. Nicki looked like a cartoon character that had been sucked into the real world. Everyone around her was in regular clothes, with normal hair, living ordinary lives. The juxtaposition between Nicki and South Jamaica, Queens was jarring and made me think of the fallacy that comes with hip-hop. Since its creation, hip-hop has always been an outlet for Black exploration. Rap groups like theWu-Tang Clanwould take snippets from kung fu movies and put them in their songs, and go by names that sound like superheroes. Method Man, RZA, GZA, Old Dirty Bastard, Ghost Face Killa, U-God, Cappadonna, Inspectah Deck and Raekwon (we love a regular name, too . They showed us what it was like to be Black men from Staten Island. They were honest, raw and played with the imaginary. Their work had substance. I wonder where that substance is now. Other than Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, there are no mainstream rappers with the same effect. The genre that I have grown to love for all its meaning and emotion, has been reduced to cars, luxury clothes and colourful wigs. Even though these things are nice and sometimes needed, they replaced hip-hop s core — introspective Black thought. The lack of reflective Black thinking is killing modern hip-hop and thus is the leading cause of the genre being filled with repetitive, empty capitalist rhetoric. Hip-hop s death started with the fallacy of the ‘gangster’. N.W.A, the infamous 80 s rap group with hip-hop greats like Easy E, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre pioneered gangsta rap. N.W.A rapped about gang life, drugs, sex and the fighting authority — police authority. Again, all of this was needed to an extent because N.W.A would be the catalyst of what rap would become. They were the mouthpiece for the hood — hood ambassadors if you will. The only problem was, none of them were part of gang life. Easy E was a drug dealer but Ice Cube, the group s most notable writer, studied architectural drafting at the Phoenix Institute of Technology. Architectural drafting is as ‘gangster’ as a painting session with Bob Ross. If you’re not a part of the street life, then how could you be a speaker for the streets? They replaced hip-hop s core — introspective Black thought. — Stephanie Okoli Hip-hop has always been pushed to the masses as being a real and non-fictional portrayal of Black life — if it’s make believe then it can t be introspective. Instead, gangster rap becomes entertainment, but entertainment for who? Dr. Dre oncesaid, “America is obsessed with murder. I think murder sells a lot more than sex. They say sex sells. I think murder sells … You don t hardly hear anybody hollering about Oliver Stone or Martin Scorsese or Clint Eastwood and all the violence in their work… to me, the records and the videos we make are just pure entertainment.” The genre was originally for streets of Black America and has expanded to the white suburbs. Hip-hop has been pushed to the mainstream. Now, the sharing of culture is fine but the portrayal of Blackness is concerning due especially since our Black industry leaders are selling murder as mere entertainment. Now, instead of gangster rap being a form of Black activism, it has been reduced to a product of consumerism. The next thing to kill hip-hop was the ‘baller fantasy’. We saw this on the East Coast withBad Boy Records. Bad Boy played up the baller persona through the music video. Each music video had models swaying their hips, mansions dripping with extravagance and movie-like cutscenes. Bad Boys prominent rappers Notorious B.I.G, Diddy, Mase and Lil’ Kim were constantly showered in luxury. There are pros and cons to the big baller aesthetic. The pro is that it gives Black people the chance to imagine beyond their circumstance. Black viewers who have been marginalized can teleport themselves to the mansion that Diddy is dancing in for three minutes. This gives Black people hope that maybe one day, they too can have this amazing life. The con is it s not real and not even the rappers can sustain the extravagant lifestyles they portray. They as well have been sucked into the empty capitalist rhetoric. Other than sex and getting money, there s not much intellectual substance in baller rap. Rap had a resuscitation in the early 2000’s with the emergence of Neo Soul and Kanye West. Kanye pushed the mundane out of hip-hop and gave us classics likeCrack MusicandHeard Em Say. Kanye changed the face of hip-hop. Here, we move from the gangster and the baller to the insightful college dropout that told the world that George Bush hates Black people. The pink polo rapper ushered in a new wave of hip-hop: abstract rap — which exists outside the genre s stereotypical mold. From Kanye, we’d get rappers like Lupe Fiasco, Kid Cudi and Drake. Unfortunately, Kanye also fell deep into capitalism and started to drift to baller rap. But, his predecessors would continue his legacy with individual songs and complete projects. InAll Falls Down, Kanye West famously said, “We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us / We tryna buy back our 40 acres / And for that paper, look how low we ll stoop / Even if you in a Benz, you still a n*gga in a coupe. Kanye articulates the Black American struggle with capitalism and therefore raps’ relationship with capitalism. From the gangster to baller to the abstract artist, hip-hop is trying to capture the American dream. The problem is, the American dream wasn t made for Black people but instead, at our expense; Black people can never find freedom through capitalism. Instead, we will either become the new oppressor or lose our way.

stanforddaily_2022_10,"Earlier this month, Stanford inaugurated theDoerr School of Sustainability, its first new school in over 70 years. Bestowed with $1.7 billion in founding donations, the schoolhas begun hiringover 60 new faculty and will include a sustainability accelerator to scale new climate solutions. Unfortunately, the Doerr School leadership has already begun to squander its potential bycontinuing to accept moneyfrom fossil fuel companies. The costs of these decisions are not to be taken lightly. This July, theStanford Woods Instituteand the student groupScientists Speak Upoffered to host Professor Naomi Oreskes for a full day of events marking the launch of the Doerr School. A Stanford alumna, Oreskes is therecipientof the 2021 Distinguished Alumni Award, Stanford Earth’s highest alumni honor. Her bookMerchants of Doubtand her work exposing climate disinformation havechanged the conversationaround climate change. This was a highly-anticipated event to highlight her work throughout the wider community, simultaneously raising the Doerr School’s profile. But Professor Oreskes rejected the invitation. Instead, she will be giving astudent-organized talkon why she declined this speaking invitation from her alma mater. In an email declining her invitation to speak at the Doerr School, which one of the authors of this article received, Oreskes cited her research on how funding shapes “not only the research agenda, but even how we conceptualize the natural world that we study.” She doesn’t “feel comfortable participating in activities marking the launch of the new Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability” because the schoolaccepts fossil fuel money. Oreskes continued, “I think the evidence is clear, and I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t stand by the evidence.” Oreskes is not alone in her reservations. We have argued in ourprevious op-edsthat fossil fuel funding damages the academic integrity of the Doerr School and delays climate action. Over 800 Stanford affiliates, including Oreskes, signed aletterin May calling on the Doerr School of Sustainability to “decline funding from fossil fuel companies.” The Doerr School of Sustainability is being crafted by a series of decisions. Leaders of the Doerr School chose to accept fossil fuel money, which in turn led Professor Oreskes to decline a speaker invitation. Doerr School leaders then decided to invite aprofessor of petroleum engineeringto be the first quarterly alumni speaker at the school’s department ofEnergy Science and Engineering. This is a demoralizing way for the new school to reveal its values. Happily, students also have decision-making power. Coinciding with the Doerr School-sponsored petroleum engineering talk,Scientists Speak Upand the StanfordCoalition for a True School of Sustainabilitywill be hosting a talk by Professor Oreskes. Now the decision is yours.AtnoononNov. 18th, you can attend a talk hosted by the Doerr School about fossil fuel extraction. Or, you can attend a talk organized by students without university support, given by an internationally-regarded historian of science. There, you would learn about how the fossil industry uses universities like Stanford to greenwash their business and undercut climate action, and how we can fight for a vibrant and livable future for everyone.

crimson_2022_40,"On October 26, 1963, John F. Kennedy made a quick trip to break ground on the Robert Frost Library at Amherst College, where the poet had taught for over 40 years. Frost had been an early supporter of Kennedy’s presidential campaign and had delivered a poem at his inauguration. Seemingly reminded of the poet’s advice to “be more Irish than Harvard,” Kennedy proclaimed, “Privilege is here, and with privilege goes responsibility.” At the time Kennedy spoke those words, he pointed out that the majority of private college students came from the nation’s wealthiest 10 percent, and income inequality had become extreme. “There is inherited wealth in this country,” JFK said, “and also inherited poverty.” Kennedy drew a direct connection between this data and Frost’s life’s work. “The men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the Nation’s greatness,” he said, “but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable.” Kennedy then issued a challenge, which many of the students present recall as a transformative moment in their life: “Unless the graduates of this college and other colleges like it who are given a running start in life — unless they are willing to put back into our society those talents, the broad sympathy, the understanding, the compassion — into the service of the Great Republic, then obviously the presuppositions upon which our democracy are based are bound to be fallible.” Some regarded it as the best speech of Kennedy’s career. It was also one of the last. *** Nearly 60 years later, the U.S. has made only limited progress in combating structural poverty and has seen inequality skyrocket. Elite colleges haven’t made any progress either — they remain the domain of the rich. Thirty-eight American colleges admit more students from the top 1 percent than the bottom 60 percent. At Harvard, more students come from families making over $500,000 per year than under $40,000. (For comparison, at The City University of New York, where I teach, 60 percent of students come from families earning less than $30,000 annually . The race data is no better. Overall, the Black population at elite colleges hasn’t significantly increased since the 1980s. This is no accident, but rather the predictable consequence of conscious choices in admissions mechanisms, which have been laid bare by Students for Fair Admissions’ ongoing lawsuit against Harvard. At trial, SFFA’s expert witness, Richard Kahlenberg, testified to a race-neutral means by which Harvard could boost both socioeconomic and racial diversity: ending the admissions preference it gives to ALDCs — athletes and the children of alumni, donors, and faculty. About 30 percent of Harvard students fall into this category including approximately 43 percent of white students. And ALDC tips are significant: The admit rate into Harvard’s freshman classes for 2014 through 2019 averaged merely 5.8 percent, but according to data produced in SFFA’s case, the College accepted nearly 34 percent of legacy applicants, 47 percent of faculty kids, and 86 percent of recruited athletes. Harvard’s own analysis indicates that the difference in admission rates between whites and Asians could be explained almost entirely by ALDC preferences. Alas, Harvard said that ending ALDC tips would jeopardize important institutional interests. The U.S. District Court judge, a graduate of Middlebury College and University of Pennsylvania Law School, bought Harvard’s argument, though the University offered relatively weak evidentiary support for its claims. Harvard could have boosted diversity through other race-neutral mechanisms, such as expanding the size of its class or admitting some students on the basis of high school class rank. Instead, it doubled down on the status quo. Now, it is overwhelmingly likely that the Supreme Court will end affirmative action. If it does, let history remember that it will be in part because of Harvard’s steadfast commitment to affirmative action for affluent whites. *** Tempting as it may be to dwell on the data, I want to focus instead on the audience to whom Kennedy chose to deliver his message. Since the premature death of his son Patrick, JFK had traveled little beyond visits to his family compound in Cape Cod. For him to venture to Amherst, it must have seemed important to Kennedy that he deliver his message to whom he did. It does to me too. If you’re reading this in The Crimson, listen: Without you, nothing will change. Universities are unlikely to change on their own. One of the most painful lessons of my book, “Poison Ivy: How Elite Colleges Divide Us,” is that college faculty and leaders tend to fall prey to the basic human tendencies to justify the system to which they belong and to believe that the world operates meritocratically. If there is hope, it lies with you. But that hope is real. College students have shaped the national agenda on the Vietnam War, divestment from South Africa, and criminal justice reform. Ultimately, colleges and universities are communities of students, faculty, and alumni. Change may not happen overnight, but it is possible. So I call upon you to join in a great rethinking of college as we’ve known it. Of the 100 largest American nonprofits, twenty-six are a college, a university, or an affiliated corporation. Combined, these schools control nearly half-a-trillion dollars in assets. That’s about twice the gold bullion reserves in Fort Knox. Harvard’s endowment alone is worth about $51 billion. Whether race-based affirmative action ends or not, it’s time for you to demand that universities’ fortunes — amassed with tax breaks worth as much as $20 billion per year — be used as an instrument of class mobilization, not stratification. To fuel the American Dream rather than to thwart it. Because, as President Kennedy asked: If not you, who? If not now, when? Evan J. Mandery graduated from Harvard College in 1989 and Harvard Law School in 1992, and is currently a Professor in the Department of Criminal Justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice."
rice_thresher_2022_44,"ByThresher Editorial Board3/22/22 11:01pm Here at the Thresher, we, like most students on campus, like to complainaboutacademicaccommodations. Still, we feel the need to bring it back up because some issues persist. Issues that, if we’re being honest, seem easily addressable, especially in this time of constantly-shifting campus norms. We’re talking about professors scheduling exams the week after, and sometimes in the days immediately following, spring break. We have not collected data to support our point, and we don’t find it appropriate to call out specific professors, but there are many members of our staff who either personally have, or have heard from friends who have, multiple exams this week. The same goes for papers and other substantial assignments. This flies in the face of what spring break is meant to be: a much-needed break where students can recharge and not have to think about school for a week. The idea that a break from school should be an actual break from schoolwork is not a novel one. In fact, faculty should be well acquainted with it. Just before this past midterm recess, the provost and future president sent anemailto faculty requesting that they “please provide students the opportunity to rest and enjoy the recess without having work due during or immediately after midterm recess. They truly need it.” Even more to the point, during the spring 2021 semester, COVID caused spring break to be replaced with what became affectionately known as sprinkle days: non-consecutive days off throughout the semester that in total represented a spring break. To ensure their similarity to an actual spring break, professors wereprohibitedfrom making assignments due or assigning exams on sprinkle days, and eventually administrationprohibiteddoing so on the day immediately after a designated sprinkle day. These precautions were necessary because, in the words of the Academic Restart Committee, “it is intended that, to the extent possible, sprinkle days be real breaks for students and instructors.” You would think the same wouldn’t need to be said for an actual spring break. Professors, we understand that semester schedules are already packed, that exams have to be scheduled sometime and we’re willing to admit that in the eyes of a student there is no “good” time to have an exam. But there is definitely a bad time to schedule one, and immediately following spring break is right up there with the worst of them. To have assignments due during breaks, and papers and exams the days we return forces students to work during what is meant to be our break from school, which defeats their purpose. So we ask, please, be cognizant of our breaks and do your best to plan around them and respect their purpose. ​​Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

ubyssey_2022_58,"Sept. 28, 2022 Written byAquila Underwood Storytelling. Telling stories. In the Western world, there tends to be the expectation that storytelling is an inaccurate way of transferring knowledge. Storytelling is a way to put children to sleep or scare friends in the middle of the night. Storytelling does not include referencing or peer reviewing or editing. In the Western world, stories are not knowledge. In the Indigenous world, storytelling is how we know everything we know. Knowledge passed down from generation to generation, changing and evolving as the world does, too. Knowledge is sometimes told in plain terms, a simple explanation from an elder about precisely when to plant the kūmara. Other times, it’s knowledge wrapped in a legend — the tale of the beginnings of your nation showing you how to care for the land so that it provides you with what you need. Storytelling to us is everything; APA referencing be damned. As Truth and Reconciliation Day approaches, the importance of storytelling reemerges. How are we to integrate our understandings of storytelling with those of the Western world when they are so obsessed with ‘reliability’? Why is simply knowing something not good enough? Indigenous peoples have been told for years that they need proof, but how are we to do so if the people asking for proof aim to constrain us to their own limited definition? Growing up, our stories were followed with: “The police would never do that without a reason,” “Well my uncle did the same thing and he was fine,” “If it’s such a big issue, why haven’t we heard of it before?” The blame is always put on us for what has happened. We provoked someone or we couldn’t adjust. We didn’t tell anyone about the genocide or the residential schools or the deliberate ‘breeding out’ of the Indian. What we got was deserved — we should have at least said something. Yet, we did. We told our stories. They were silenced by settler society. Instead of being able to tell everyone, we were forced to tell ourselves, to pass down the trauma to our children so that what happened to us was not forgotten. We are being heard again now. The stories that have been passed down through the storytelling of elders are allowed to be spoken again — and people are choosing to listen. Storytelling is key to settlers understanding that we live in a world dominated by colonial structures, and that change cannot happen in so-called “Canada” without Indigenous frameworks. I grew up listening to stories. I grew up surrounded by words both spoken and written, knowledge being passed from my community to myself. While my histories are still incomplete, the knowledge I have of myself and the lived experiences of my people is accurate. Details are unnecessary if the message continues to be shared. I read my fellow Indigenous kin, and when I meet them I listen to them. My knowledge is growing constantly despite growing up with a colonial construct of what fact is. I know that there was a genocide. I know that my ancestors experienced unthinkable things at the hand of colonial greed. I know how to maintain my relationship to the land and my kin. I know that when an Indigenous person speaks out about their experiences or their histories, there is always truth. I hope you begin to understand this too. Whether you’re a settler or Indigenous or a visitor to Indigenous lands. Storytelling is how we will learn. Believe your Indigenous kin or friends or loved ones. While Indigenous people are the only ones who can tell our stories, we need the help of everyone else in order for our stories to be heard. To become fact. Once our stories are known, we will not be forced to hand our trauma to our children to keep for us. If you’re a settler, silence your queries and believe what you hear, don’t interrupt or scoff — don’t share the things you have heard from your dad who’s in the RCMP. You must listen, and you must learn. Give us the space we deserve, because storytelling is our path to learning the truth and reconciling the past with our present and future.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_18,"Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to have fiercely underestimated the resolve of the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In his acts of unprovoked war, Putin has also unintentionally solidified — if not strengthened — the informal alliance between Ukraine and the West. It seems as though the Russian autocrat was deluded by his own lies and propaganda enough to believe that such a takeover would be a cakewalk. It has proven to be otherwise, and it is likely we’ve yet to see the worst. Meanwhile, Western powers must be judicious in their continued response and acknowledgment of the real enemy. Under Putin, the Russian army continues tocommit war crimesin its attacks on innocent Ukrainian civilians. There is mounting evidence of human rights abuses and violations of international law, in which civilian residences, schools, hospitals and orphanages have all been targets of Russian aggression. Ancient cities are being leveled by the day as hundreds of thousands have no other choice but to seek refuge in neighboring cities and countries. As we speak, families are being torn apart while women, children and the elderly are forced to abandon their livelihoods in Ukraine and the able-bodied men remain to defend their homeland. It is a war the Ukrainian people didn’t ask for, but one in which they have risen to the occasion. There has been an overwhelmingcollective response, expression of outrage and condemnation of Putin throughout the West. The Russian army’s advances havesignaledthe largest declaration of war since World War II and the end of a longstanding peace in Europe. To those who weren’t yet alive or are too young to remember the Cold War and the ironfisted rule of the United Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR , the war in Ukraine serves as a bitter reminder of the precariousness and fragility of democracy. Nevertheless, we should resist the urge to blindly accept the absolute narratives coming from the political and media establishment about our own involvement in this Eastern conflict. Sanctions are the West’s only weapon in combating Russia without actual use of military force. Cutting off major banks and financial institutions, banning oil and natural gas imports and freezing the assets of Putin’s cronies and Russian oligarchs are all viable options that the U.S. and European Union (EU havealready begunimplementing. However, imposing harsh sanctions will certainly have dire implications, for it is virtually impossible to inflict “targeted” or “strategic” sanctions without placing a heavy burden on ordinary people. Current international sanctions have already plummeted the Russian ruble tonew lowsand have forced interest rates up 20% in order to prevent a total collapse of their currency. With a severely compromised economy and calamitous recession looming, the Russian people will soon be forced to stand in breadlines reminiscent of the Soviet Union years. Additionally, the vilification of the Russian people for the unspeakable actions of their dictator is hardly fair. Thesymbolic gesturesof pulling vodka and Russian dressing from supermarket shelves to exiling artists, performers and athletes only further stigmatize ethnic Russians and their culture. Moreso, it plays into the narrative of their victimization by the West and may lead to even more ethnonationalism. There is a tendency we often have in the West to assume that the rest of the world should be willing to make sacrifices for the democratic values we hold so dear. Yet, the reality for people living in post-Soviet, present-day Russia is that they have witnessedmultiple regime changeswithin the past three decades, and their current autocratic regime isknownto jail or forcibly make individuals disappear if they speak out against or protest its actions. Americans are far too quick to cast judgment when others aren’t so willing to defend their Western worldviews, let alone willing to die for them. Social media can be a great tool, if used responsibly. The social media response to this crisis has largely been one of steadfast support for Ukraine and humanitarian organizations in their efforts to provide safety, shelter and asylum for the displaced population that now consists of over 1 million Ukrainians. As such, the dissemination of valuable information can be life-saving. However, the way that people from the West aredonating in droves to military and arms effortsis disconcerting, given most social media users’ lack of knowledge of geopolitical history or any real stake in the matter. A triumph for Ukraine, with the least bloodshed and destruction possible, is all we can really hope for. We must consider the implications of involving the U.S. in another proxy war by which we effectivelyturn Ukraine into the next Afghanistan, jeopardize the global economy, or worse, provoke an all-out nuclear war. While we cannot deny the existential threat that Putin poses to the West, we must also weigh the consequences of our own interference in his vanity project. We cannot afford to let our emotions be hijacked for ulterior geopolitical aims or to risk mutual-assured destruction for our own self-righteousness — or worse — ignorance.

stanforddaily_2022_84,"The author has requested anonymity for fear of harassment and doxxing. Content warning: this article contains references to suicide, self-harm and transphobia. My sibling’s mind had changed by the time they were 11. That was in 2015. Neither of us understood the concept of gender or nonbinary yet — or even what it really meant to be trans, for that matter. But my sibling told me, “I don’t think I can be a ___. But I know I’m not a ___, either.” For a year after that, my sibling fought their gender. They tried on different clothes and different pronouns. None of it felt right. Then, when they were 12, we were introduced to the concept of nonbinary. I don’t need you to understand what it means to be nonbinary. But can you understand the smile on my sibling’s face? The way their back straightened, the way their voice got stronger and clearer in an instant? Life was not easy for them. This world is not tailored to trans people; this world beats them down and does its best to undermine their sense of self. Teachers at my sibling’s middle school refused to call my sibling by their name or pronouns. We were lucky enough to have supportive parents, who went to school administrators and asked that my sibling’s chosen name be noted on official documents. At their middle school, students’ nicknames were listed alongside their given names. Teachers used all of these “nicknames” except for my sibling’s. When my sibling asked their history teacher why, the teacher said, “that is not your name.” There were no non-gendered bathrooms at their middle school. Admin told them they would simply have to use the ___’s bathroom. My sibling did, once. They went back to class and smiled through it. Then they came home and cried. They chanted, over and over, “I’m not a ___, I’m not a ___, I’m not a ____ — they’re going to say that I’m a ___, they’re going to say I did it once and I’m wrong, I’m lying, I’m a stupid lying ___, but I’mnot— ” Our grandmother sent them emails with articles explaining to them why being trans and nonbinary was not real, and how they would grow out of it and “be normal” again in a few years. Some of their friends ceased being their friends. Some of their friends were told by their parents to stop spending time with my sibling. My sibling’s pronouns were contagious. My sibling’s identity was dangerous. Their existence was disgusting. Their existence was not allowed. Their existence was debated, again and again, in front of them, on national television in political and pop cultural debates, in the hallways where they were told over and over that they were wrong. When my sibling was 13 they were hospitalized for a suicide attempt for the first time. Thirteen. 13. 10 + 3 years. Do you know what that means? Do you understand that my sibling was in so much pain that when they were 13 years old, barely in puberty, they attempted to end their life? Are you a big sister? Are you a big sibling? Do you understand what that means? To come home and be told they are in the hospital? They had wanted to not be alive. They were never going to smile or laugh or annoy me again. Do you know what it is to be terrified? Guilty? Do you know the shame? The rage? They would never smile or laugh again, but at least they would never have to experience being told that their identity was not real, that something as tangible and true as the pavement under our feet was a lie. My sibling was in and out of the hospital for years. My baby sibling wanted to die for years. Do you understand that? So helpmeunderstand. Why does it matter if my sibling is not one of two genders? Please don’t come to me with religion. It’s not that. My sibling found shul comforting, but they did not go for five years. Religious life as a queer person is scary. Hebrew itself is a language with two genders — it does not accommodate for them. I’m not angry at Hebrew for this. My rabbi rewrote a prayer so that it used conjugated words of both genders and unconjugated words wherever possible. He rewrote the parents’ blessing, so that my parents could bless my sibling in Hebrew words that applied to who my sibling was. If my rabbi can spend hours delving through liturgical Hebrew to make synagogue a little more accommodating for my sibling, you can manage to not have a sign that calls them meaningless. My sibling is not one of two genders. My sibling hasneverbeen one of two genders. And why does that matter? Why is it so important to you what pronouns my sibling uses? The lives of trans and nonbinary people are not a debate.They are real.They are real people and you would tell them that they do not exist. Why? I want to understand. I really want to know why. How does it hurt you if my sibling gets to smile? The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor. We’d love to hear your thoughts.

state_press_2022_30,"For many people, promises are meant to be kept, and if you break a promise, you will be held accountable for it. For ASU athletic director Ray Anderson, that doesn t seem to be the case with the football team. Upon firing head football coach Todd Graham in 2017, Andersontold the mediaWe deserve more. We have the capacity. And the University and the community deserve more, and very frankly should demand more. But when ASU fans demand more, and when they demand answers, Anderson has been oddly silent on the state of the football team. I am tired of being patient. In the same press conference, Anderson said, We have to get to the point where we are recruiting four- and five-star football players who want to come and play here because they know the development for the player, and the development for the coaching. The retention of the coaching is not going to potentially get in their way if, in fact, they want to go play in the NFL. The NCAA is running aninvestigationinto the recruiting practices of the coaching staff. During the pandemic, all recruiting in the NCAA was put on hold. Schools could not host players, coaches could not visit players or their families; but allegedly Sun Devil coaches did everything they weren t supposed to do. They allegedly hosted recruits, visited players and their families. Since then,five coacheshave either been fired or resigned, and punishments for the program will still loom large once the investigation is over. But the one thing that hasn t changed is the men in charge of everything. Ray Anderson and Herm Edwards are still employed, while most of Herm s assistants are gone. ASU has the worst high schoolrecruiting classin the Pac-12, and the Sun Devils are ranked 108th in the country in recruiting. To put that into context, the 1-11 Arizona Wildcats have the 22nd best recruiting class in the country and are 2nd in the Pac-12. A school that has won one game out of their last 16 is doing better at recruiting than Ray Anderson s Sun Devils. Here is my interaction with AD Ray Anderson.@ralphamsden@ChrisKarpman@kentsomers@DougHaller@BDenny29@Vincemarotta@Gambo987@wilnerhotline@danbickley@MattBarrie@JordanSimone38@sbordow@UnpluggedDoug@bradcesmatpic.twitter.com/xwK8m9oT5J Sun Devil fans like the man in the video, long-time season ticket holder, and Sun Devil alumni Aaron Hill, are growing tired of empty promise after empty promise. Hill said, What I want from an athletic director are humility and accountability. When Graham was fired, Anderson scrutinized him for his recruiting classes, but Edwards is not facing any of the same backlash for having a far worse recruiting record than Graham. Hill also admitted the way he approached Anderson was wrong saying, I m obnoxious, I probably shouldn t have done that. According to247sports.com, during Graham s tenure at ASU, the Sun Devils were ranked as high as 19th in the nation and as low as 39th. Compare that to Edwards tenure at ASU, when the Sun Devils have only been ranked as high as 24th, and now sit as the 108th best team in the nation when it comes to recruiting. In the samepress conferencein 2017 when he spoke about Graham, Anderson said, We want to win consistently across the board in all of our sports, and so in performance on football we have not done that in the four years since I ve been here, not consistently. We have been average 7-5 and second place in the riddled Pac-12 south is not our aspiration. Where have the Sun Devils gone from that day in football? Last season, ASU finished 8-5 and third place in that same riddled Pac-12 south. Ray Anderson was right when he said We deserve more. We definitely deserve more. No more empty promises or things that haven t gone right, we deserve more success, and if we don t get that we have the right to feel angry about it. Especially if the people in charge aren t being held accountable for it. Reach the reporter atjdhinkl1@asu.eduand follow@JeffreyHinkle_on Twitter.

crimson_2022_145,"It was sort of odd, learning that I had been the target ofa hateful, homophobic emailvia a campus-wide message from President Bacow denouncing it. But it’s August and fall move-in is underway, which, for an employee in the College Housing Office, means some emails take a little longer to get to this time of year. More than odd, though, it was anachronistic. I don’t intend to share the email publicly for the same reasons President Bacow outlined, but it felt like something out of my childhood. Growing up in the 90s and 2000s, hate organizations like the Westboro Baptist Church were common fixtures in the media, protesting the funerals for victims of brutal hate crimes likeMatthew Shepardorpicketing college campuses.They employed rhetoric similar to that which I saw in the email, including references to HIV/AIDS or, now, Monkeypox. I admit I was initially amused at the thought that someone had gone through the effort of crawling through Harvard websites or list-servs to identify openly BGLTQ staff and faculty and send such a vile screed. But then I realized there is nothing amusing about it. The last several years have seen a resurgence of hate against queer folks in this country. Pundits and politicians use false rhetoric about“grooming”toerase queer peoplefrom school curricula. Far-right extremists target innocuous events where drag performers read to children withthreats of violence and hate speech.Hate groups have recentlydisruptedjoyful Pride month events nationwide. At around the same time I read the email, Boston Children’s Hospital — an institution (and Harvard Medical School affiliate at the forefront of gender-affirming care for transgender youth — issued a statement aboutthreats its clinicians and staff have received.More than a dozen states havepassed lawsthat target trans people, including by denying them access to life-saving healthcare and barring children from playing sports. It’s easy to feel insulated from all of this. Harvard has been one of the most accepting and thoughtful spaces I’ve encountered when it comes to supporting queer students and staff. During my six years working at Harvard, I’ve been continually impressed by Harvard’s efforts to make sure queer students are safe on campus. It helps, of course, that we live in Massachusetts — the first state in the U.S. to embrace marriage equality and one known for its political and social progressivism. But we aren’t insulated, really. Just a few years ago, we saw the“Straight Pride Parade”march on Boston City Hall. That same year, one Harvard University police officer called another ahomophobic slur. It’s not clear whether this email was written by a Harvard affiliate, but I don’t doubt that there are some individuals on campus who hold those beliefs. There will always be more work to do to make Harvard a more inclusive space – work that is inextricable from that of creating a more inclusive society. Harvard does not exist in a bubble. While students are here, they greatly impact the Cambridge, Boston, and Massachusetts communities. After graduating, many of our alumni will become leaders — the people empowered to move their fields, their hometowns, the country, and the world towards a fuller embrace of the BGLTQ community. That work starts on campus. We can begin by making it clear that hate has no place at Harvard. To BGLTQ staff, faculty, and graduate students, I encourage you to add your name to theOut @ Harvardlist to ensure that queer students know that they are welcome here and have resources they can contact. To upper-level students, make sure you welcome first-years to campus warmly and remind them that all students, regardless of their identities, belong at Harvard. To all students, stay engaged with the events hosted by the Office of BGLTQ Student Life and BGLTQ specialty tutors and proctors. Beyond our campus, vote and advocate for politicians and policies that affirm the dignity of all queer people. And, if you haven’t already, register to vote either here or in your home state and request your ballot prior to November’s elections. A lot has improved since I was younger, but the events of the past few years in our community (and my inbox are a reminder that there remains much to do. I challenge members of the Harvard community to think about what your role is in advancing inclusion and belonging both on and off campus. Brian M.

rice_thresher_2022_13,"ByNicole Van Den Heuvel10/4/22 11:22pm Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. The Center for Career Development thanks Wills Rutherford for his time as a Peer Career Advisor at Rice, providing students with career guidance, and we congratulate him on securing his job from the Rice Expo. Responding tohisopinion piece, “The Rice career fair fails Rice students,” I’ll elaborate upon the factors employers consider when deciding whether to participate in Rice career expos, the overall recruiting environment and the process Rice students should pursue when seeking employment. Rice is an elite school with top talent and employers actively seek to hire our students. These factors alone, however, will not guarantee that employers will spend their time and resources recruiting at Rice. Why aren’t some companies such as Tesla attending career expos? Many factors include the employers’ hiring needs, recruiting resources (people and money , physical location of the employer and Rice, needed skills and competencies, majors, success with past hiring efforts, ability to project hiring needs nine months into the future and size of the student population. For example, UT Austin has over 6.5 times as many students as Rice from which to recruit. Due to physical on-campus space restrictions, we have a waitlist of employers eager to attend every year. This year, for the first time, we offered two consecutive fall expos, an in-person expo and a virtual one. Both were well-attended with 159 employers and 2,589 students. We encouraged students to go to both, as there were different employers attending. The expo will never meet the needs of every Rice student, nor should it, and we will never have the perfect mix or type of employer to satisfy every student. The expo is but one way to network and secure an internship or employment. Employers recruit in multiple ways including attending expos, conducting campus interviews, recruiting off-campus, hosting information sessions or coffee chats, posting jobs in Handshake, and increasingly more are recruiting virtually. The CCD actively advises employers on their ideal recruiting strategy. Excluding Moderna, who recently connected with us, every employer mentioned in the article has current job postings or active postings in the past 12 months. For example, Tesla currently lists 43 active job postings and had 264 postings for Rice students over the past 12 months. Students, the best way to secure internships and jobs is through a multi-layered approach. The first is the easiest one: connect with the CCD via a workshop, appointment, drop-in, Peer Career Advisor,or online resources and we can help chart your path. Attend employer information sessions and coffee chats. Connect with employers on Handshake. If you can’t find your targeted employers, we can connect you with alumni or help you sign up for an externship to gain more knowledge and contacts. It’s exciting to think about the many possibilities and career options ahead of you. The world needs your talent and we look forward to helping you find and make your place in the world. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_17,"GENED 1038: Sleep was once known to be the gemmiest of gems. It fulfills Harvard’s Science & Technology in Society General Education requirement without demanding excessive hours in a lab or long nights working on dense problem sets — a gift from heaven for more humanities-inclined students like myself. Still, the course offers a compelling introduction into an important field of scientific research. The class is taught byleadingresearchers who have dedicated their careers to understanding the relationship between the circadian pacemaker and wake-sleep homeostasis,conductedcutting-edge studies on topics like theeffectof light exposure on melatonin secretion before sleep and the cardiovascular impact ofcircadianmisalignment, and assisted professionalathletesin crafting their sleeping routines. All this expertise to help students discern the answer to one question: Why do we sleep? This Fall, however, students will have to work harder to seek an answer: Sleep has ceased its gemminess and become a hard, old rock. It seems the Gen Ed Gods deemed the course too much of a gift to struggling humanities students, with a number of changes seemingly having been made to increase difficulty. This semester, in-class quizzes have been instituted at the start and finish of each class. Students must now sit for a cumulative final exam worth 30 percent of their course grade which takes the place of the old 10-page term paper. Harvard’s attempt to re-create GENED 1038 is wrong — not because it makes our lives harder, but because to de-gemify Sleep is to defeat the class’ essential purpose: to promote student wellbeing. Sleep is a mental wellness class. Alongside mini-assignments designed to introduce us to scientific research skills and readings on key concepts, a significant portion of the coursework is spent using software to track and reflect on one’s own sleeping habits. A survey, completed every morning and evening, asks basic, quantitative (e.g. “What time did you try to fall asleep? and “What time did you finally wake up?” and qualitative questions. Being a qualitative Sociology concentrator, I took interest in one in particular: “For each of the following, indicate how you feel right now by clicking on each line and adjusting the sliders.” (The line stretches from “Stressed Out” to “Calm / Relaxed” . Each day of our sleep diary period, I have had to wake up and mindfully consider how I feel. I’ve noticed that, as soon as the day starts and the assignments pile up in my brain, I consistently self-evaluate more stressed out than calm. Generally, though, I feel fine. I asked a friend, another senior who’s taking Sleep to save time for work on their thesis, whether they had a similar experience. “No doubt,” they said. “I’m never above 50 percent.” Surely, we’re not alone in feeling this way. Is there something wrong with us? No, not really. Our stress is a by-product of Harvard’s environment. Most students who come here were superstars in their hometown. Even if we don’t mean to be competitive or performative, we are — that’s what got us here. As such, if you don’t watch out, your identity can quickly reduce to the things you do. How many midterms do you have this week? When’s your next case interview? How’s leadership on that extracurricular going? Before you know it, all you can say about yourself is your elevator pitch for your thesis or your name, year, house, and concentration. But, who are you? Like, really: who… are… you? The most powerful way we can counter this grave reality is to wake up every morning and make a conscious decision to rest. This is my non-scientific answer to the age-old question about sleep’s function: It forces us to remember that we are not simply what we do — that we are so much more. Sleep is a mini-Sabbath. The faculty of the Sleep Gen Ed and members of the Committee on General Education have a choice: to join therevolutionofrestor to succumb to the system. I applaud class faculty and teaching staff for the progress thus far. It is not easy to structure a class one way and then to restructure it in the opposite. In a welcome change, in-class quiz questions seem to have become easier and readings have lightened, but the work is unfinished. Sleep is one small part of the constant fight to prioritize student well-being over performance, and we’re winning. It is time for administration, professors, and students to have broader conversations about our school’s culture — to envision a world where academics don’t have to worry about quantifying class performance or productivity to prove themselves credible. Where students smile in lecture because they know their professors care. Where we transcend the fog that falls during midterm season and we see each other for who we are. In a pile of cold, hard stones, Sleep can be a gem again. Sterling M.

wildcat_arizona_2022_29,"Mary Ann Vagnerova An image of a person talking with an online mental health provider by Mary Ann Vagnerova Luke HamlinNovember 15, 2022 The online community that supports students’ mental health is larger than you may think. Counselors and clinicians at the University of Arizona are committed to bringing this community to the student body on campus. Life has increasingly moved online post-pandemic, and this move has generated virtual means to effectively address mental health, changing the landscape of health support for the benefit of students. Student services have expanded to includeTogetherall, a newly adopted resource within UA Campus Health’s Counseling & Psych Services. Togetherall has recently emerged as an innovator and leader for improving mental health, and they’re doing it remotely. It provides a safe, anonymous space to connect and converse with others who seek similar support, a sense of community and improvement of their mental health. Monitored by licensed clinicians who provide instantaneous responses with full-time access, the platform has been a reference point for many health representatives at the University of Arizona for its reputation of effectiveness. The Assistant Director of Counseling & Psych Services at Campus Health, Debra Cox-Howard, was instrumental in bringing the online community, Togetherall, to campus. While Togetherall is not directly affiliated with the UA, the efforts of Cox-Howard and others have advocated for its expansion onto campus. Its recent addition as a mental health resource will help educate faculty and diversify its portfolio on treatment options when it comes to properly assisting students. Among the many online services offered by CAPS, Cox-Howard emphasized the importance of Togetherall. When asked about the program she said, “they do a very good job of linking back to our website where you can find self-help information and other resources that are available to you as a student on this campus.” Togetherall aligns with the student-driven approach that CAPS takes to ensure a healthy academic experience. Their approach to online services creates convenience and time efficiency for students, as the choice to support a fully online platform was intentional and due to the impact of the pandemic on student life. Many students continue to learn remotely, and health professionals like Cox-Howard strive to meet students where they are. Students have given feedback that Togetherall helped them feel less isolated in the midst of the pandemic. This was one piece of technology that gained popularity from the pandemic, and it certainly validated the idea that there is an excessive amount of time and cost associated with commuting to a meeting that could just as effectively be held online. Togetherall appeals to students as it is easily accessible, always available and free to join. “2.5 million students are able to access the platform, and CAPS gets thousands of new students that are joining every month,” Cox-Howard said. The sudden influx of students joining the online mental health community is likely due to the comfort in online anonymity and the ability to share sensitive information freely without worrying about personal identification or association. According to Cox-Howard, a striking “64% of students are sharing thoughts or feelings on Togetherall because it’s anonymous.” Anonymity is simply more time efficient for students because it focuses on only providing the important information and avoiding any introductions or social interactions present in-person that may otherwise inflict on students’ treatment processes. Pros and cons exist for both online and in-person treatment, and Cox-Howard believes that online treatment has strengthened enough to become as effective as the human presence of a therapist or community group because, “it’s going to depend upon the person and their needs” and “we as clinicians have become more savvy as to how we can still interact with students.” As a senior student, I have experienced the UA before and after the pandemic, which brought significant online mental health opportunities to campus. In my experience, health professionals have built the skill set to sufficiently treat patients and handle their needs virtually. While I personally believe that using Togetherall will efficiently address your critical needs as a person to help you perform at your best as a student, UA Clinical Assistant Professor at the UA College of Medicine and Director of the Addiction Medicine Fellowship, Dr. Elisa Gumm, shared another perspective on her experience expanding the online mental health community. The Addiction Medicine Fellowship, composed of student medical fellows, focuses on improving treatment of individual substance abuse in the greater Tucson community; the fellowship offers a whole host of online services such as telehealth appointments. The addiction community came together to support their own during COVID-19. While Dr. Gumm was not aware of the platform Togetherall, she emphasized the easy accessibility of similar organizations that have built supportive online communities. Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery and an organization unique to Tucson, Buddhist Recovery Network, all offer peer-supported online modalities and recovery models for both mental health and addiction issues. From our conversation, it’s clear that many mental health professionals believe that utilizing Togetherall and mental health resources alike should be an essential part of the student experience. The first step to addressing your mental health is having a conversation with a professional support structure, and the College of Medicine has made significant efforts to bring that accessibility online for their patients. Gumm said, “We have to stop thinking that everybody fits in this same box and that everyone is going to benefit from face-to-face or virtual.” Togetherall is available to everyone with access to the internet, no matter your schedule or situation. The space has a place for many struggles, needs and treatments. RELATED:UA offers mental health resources to help students Life moved online may have increased the struggle to control mental health among college students. Since the beginning of the pandemic,social isolationhas likely been one of the leading factors that have affected mental health. Fortunately, technology has allowed for many aspects of life to continue and for many people to get the mental health support they need. A Zoom classroom alone can reveal how technology has transformed and improved our society to provide more efficient solutions to our most basic needs. Technology creates convenience and opportunities to address new challenges and it can help you focus on your mental health. CAPS illustrates that Togetherall is a great solution for students searching for comfortable and cost-efficient mental health relief. I urge others to explore Togetherall to address concerns and establish connections. Conducting self-care is not selfish and protecting your well-being should be prioritized by every student, even before that overdue homework assignment.

crimson_2022_112,"I’m writing this in the cool night after my fever has broken. In these few moments of clarity I get — from the physical pain and the mental — I spiral into existential crisis. I know that, in all reality, Covid-19 will soon pass me by and slide into the archives of wacky stories for me to tell when I get better. I know that in a week or so from now, I will be testing negative, taking finals, and grousing about how annoying it is to run between all my classes. I know that I am notthe demographic to dieto this. I am young, and approximately healthy, and with access to enough painkillers and vitamins to take out a horse. I know I will be fine. It’s just that, before I slid the key into the lock of my room for what I didn’t realize until too late was the last free time in a while, before I had to question whether my nasty headache was from stress or lack of sleep or — surprise third option! — Covid, before the rapid test bled into two red lines and I sent my parents the “I think I have Covid” panic text with two minutes left on the timer, I thought I was immune. Now, I am confronted with the fact that I am not only very mortal and susceptible to infectious disease, but also excruciatingly fragile. Six walls and a window that gets dark too early is enough to do me in. I’m a lab rat in a cage, but at least they get wheels to run on. I’m afraid of doors now. Isn’t that pathetic? Many havewritten beforeon Harvard’s unsatisfactory spring 2022 Covid-19 isolation policy. I should know firsthand how unsatisfactory it is; I’ve dealt with every stage of it. Eighteen Chrome tabs open trying to figure out which Harvard websites are up-to-date with the new policy. The second email with additional guidance on how to isolate in place that the HUHS Contact Tracing Team promises me but never delivers. The day the Isolation Dining Pick-Up station in Kirkland House runs out of all bottled water except sparkling, so I, dehydrated and half-delirious, pour myself cups of hot water that taste faintly of coffee grounds. Yet, what scares me most about Harvard’s isolation policy is me. As I see it, my potential to harm all the healthy, non-infected, unknowing people just happily walking around campus is massive. I venture outside my disease incubator of a room once a day to drop off a Covid test and pick up dinner from Kirkland. Every time, I want to scream at everyone I encounter: I’m a contagion! Get away from me! Put your masks on and run in the opposite direction! It’s insane that I am allowed to walk on the street amongst people who are none the wiser, stifling coughs in my double-layered masks while they turn and chat. At the same time, I selfishly don’t want to brand myself as Covid-positive so that people veer away from me. Isolation is lonely enough. The emotional toll of being stuck in a box for days has opened my waterworks and won’t let them close. I feel it, that terrible lump of emotion and twitch of tears, whenever I get a scrap of human connection. The first time a friend called me and I picked up, I spent all 30 minutes of that call sobbing into the phone. I burst into tears at a club meeting over Google Meet, of all things. I know my fear of infecting other people on the street, of turning them as weak and transient as I currently feel, is largely irrational. I would have to spend 15 or more minutes with anyone indoors for them to be considered a close contact at risk of contracting Covid-19 from me. But I am not a scientist with an innate understanding of my infectious period. I only know that it feels ethically wrong for me to be able to place other people in potential harm’s way, without their knowledge. It scares me how thin the barriers to known, intentional harm are. It scares me that Harvard is banking their isolation policy on the brittle moral weighings of people who are already much too fragile from Covid. I miss outside. I miss Eliot dining hall, and lying on friends’ carpets, and unmasked laughter. I miss normalcy. If Harvard’sCovid yearssaw time freeze, isolation is the most hellish version of that. But come the end of my day five, I will follow the isolation policy to the best of my ability. If I’m still symptomatic, I’m locking myself in here again. This will harm me, no doubt. But crucially, I do not want to harm other people. Christina M. Xiao ’24, an Associate Editorial Editor, is a joint concentrator in Computer Science and Government in Eliot House."
state_press_2022_67,"ASU junior wide receiver Zeek Freeman (14 drops a pass while in the end zone. ASU won 40-3 against NAU at Sun Devil Stadium Thursday, Sept. 1, 2022. ASU fired Herm Edwards as its football coach after a horrifying loss to Eastern Michigan at home on Sept. 17. Now, with a full season still ahead, ASU must start the process of finding and hiring a new football coach. There are plenty of names circulating, with some of them being less legitimate than others. Michelle Gardner, an Arizona State beat writer for Arizona Republic, said any potential of ASU hiring Urban Meyer is a “pipe dream.” She also said that Deion Sanders isn’t an awful candidate, but that it would be unlikely that he would be at ASU for the long haul. Each of the potential coach candidates would have to deal with the yet-to-be-seen ramifications of the ongoingNCAA investigationinto ASU recruiting violations. That could prove to be too big of a scare for some of the bigger names the University will undoubtedly try to bring to the football program. With those circumstances in mind, here are the names that ASU should pursue to be its next football coach. 1. Jonathan Smith Jonathan Smithhas taken what was once a Pac-12 bottom-feeder Oregon State football team to prominence. During Smith’s first season in Corvallis in 2018, OSU went 2-10, but the team steadily increased its win total each season (excluding the COVID-19 shortened 2020 season before reaching 7-6 in 2021. The team is off to a great start in 2022, and led No. 7 USC heading into the fourth quarter in their week four matchup. The Beavers are 3-1 this season. He has done a lot with a relatively smallbudget, at least compared to what ASU has done with abudgetthat spent over $10 million more in expenses for football. ASU should go out of its way to tempt Smith with the possibility of a higher budget. After all, if Smith can have the success that he has had at OSU with a much smaller budget, who is to say that he can’t do even more with more money? Outside of his time at OSU, Smith has years of experience in the Pac-12 conference. He coached with Chris Peterson at the University of Washington as a co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. ASU could use a talented offensive mind such as Smith. He would be an excellent addition to the ASU football program and should be the priority target. 2.Justin Wilcox While Jonathan Smith is more of an offensive mind, Justin Wilcox is better known for his defenses. Excluding Wilcox’s first season, his Cal defense has regularly been one of the top five best defenses in the Pac-12. Wilcox has gone 29-30 during his time at Cal. This isn’t a bad record given how, like Smith at OSU, Wilcox hasreceivedslightly less funding for his program than ASU spends on its own football program. If ASU can continue to attract the strong offensive talent it has attracted in the past, and if Wilcox can pick a quality offensive coordinator, he could take ASU’s football program to the next level. Bringing a top-tier defense to Sun Devil Stadium is crucial to take the program to its highest potential. 3.Kalani Sitake Sitake is a great coach and an excellent defensive strategist. He’s led BYU to three bowl wins and five winning seasons as coach, and they reached the top 10 in 2021 before losing to Boise State. Like Wilcox, Sitake would provide a defensive spark that ASU needs to handle the top offenses in the Pac-12. However, Sitake isn’t as sure of a get as Wilcox or Smith may be, especially with BYU making themoveto the Big-12 conference this upcoming season. But, if ASU can write a big enough check, there’s a chance Sitake would sign on. 4.Dirk Koetter Koetter is a familiar name to many diehard ASU fans, as hecoachedthe Sun Devils from 2001 to 2006. He notched multiple bowl wins for ASU before leaving for the NFL. After his stint as the offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons in the 2019-2021 season, it was thought that Koetter was calling it a career. However, he took a job at Boise State (where he was also a coach as a senior analyst, and he ended up beinghiredas their interim offensive coordinator for the 2022 college football season. If Koetter didn’t just take the job to fill in the gap Boise State had after they fired their previous offensive coordinator, ASU would be wise to reach out to Koetter to see if he wants to hop back on to the coaching carousel. Koetter knows how to run an offense, and his roots in the west and his NFL experience would certainly attract the recruits that ASU needs to compete for Pac-12 championships. 5.Shaun Aguano After Herm Edwards was fired as coach, Aguano was quicklynamedthe interim coach for ASU. His tough-love style stood out to many, as he quickly had the ASU football team doing things they hadn’t previously. Donnie Henderson on differences under Shaun Aguano: There will be no walking anywhere during practice.We found ourselves being a little more physical.We challenged the scout team to kick our tail, so to speak. While some fans may not be happy with the on-the-field results under Aguano thus far, he was handed a sinking ship to float, and it remains to be seen what he can do for the rest of the season. Aguano has deep roots in Arizona, winning four state titles as coach of the Chandler High School football team. ASU spotted him and brought him on as a running backs coach, where he oversaw prolific rushing attacks led by the likes of Eno Benjamin and Rachaad White. READ MORE:ASU interim coach Shaun Aguano looks to lead program together as a family However, what makes him stand out may also be his weakness. “He was a high school coach four years ago, and he has never been a (college coordinator,” Gardner said. But, if Aguano’s limited experience in college football isn’t a problem, he could provide the roots and passion ASU football needs to reinvigorate the fan base and bring in Arizona’s best high school football players. Gardner also said of Aguano, “I would love to see Aguano get a shot because of what he stands for.” These five coaches should be who Ray Anderson and Michael Crow target as their coaching candidates. But, if none of them work out, there are a few other coaches to keep an eye on. Danny Gonzales Danny Gonzales is the current coach at the University of New Mexico. The Lobos aren’t a strong program, but Gonzales waspreviouslythe defensive coordinator at ASU in 2018, and he would easily slide back into the program if ASU wanted to hire a familiar name. Deion Sanders Deion Sanders is one of the names that has been swirled around with the likes of Urban Meyer as more of a flashy hire. However, Sanders does not come with the baggage that Meyer does, and going from coach at Jackson State to coach at ASU would be an upgrade in every possible way. It would be a surprise if ASU hired Sanders. But if the administration wants to make a big splash and prioritize recruiting, Sanders could be the next ASU coach. Mike Norvell Norvell would be the perfect fit at ASU, if not for him turning around Florida State football after the program seemed to betreadingwater a year ago. Norvell served most notably as an offensive coordinator at ASU from 2012 to 2015. It may be difficult to drag him away from Florida State, but if it’s possible, there has never been a better time to bring Norvell back to Tempe.

thetech_mit_2022_32,"In aninfographic circulated by the MIT Graduate Student Union (GSU in Fall 2021, the union contrasts its “grassroots union organizing” approach with “admin-dictated advocacy” to demonstrate why the former is superior for empowering graduate student-workers. While admin-dictated advocacy is private and unaccountable, grassroots union organizing is transparent, public and democratic. In order to drive home the point, the graphic states that “o ur union, as part of UE United Electrical Workers ,will be committed to open bargainingto keep the admin accountable to grad workers and to keep the broader grad worker population informed and engaged” (emphasis added . Open negotiations are contract negotiations where all workers covered by the collective bargaining agreement can attend. Fast forward to today, just days before contract negotiations are set to begin between the GSU and MIT’s administration, and the union has recently announced internally that bargaining will, in fact, be closed to all graduate students, save for members of the Bargaining Committee (BC and a handful of graduate students who may be invited to discuss specialized bargaining topics. This seeming reversal in policy was decided behind closed doors by the BC and was not even subject to debate among the union’s own central decision-making body, the Department Organizing Committee, let alone among the grad student population at-large. The BC’s stated reasons for rejecting open bargaining were roughly threefold: 1 low attendance would signal weakness to the administration; 2 a vocal minority of grad students could sabotage negotiations; and 3 the bargaining guidelines discourage impromptu comments, and therefore grad students would not get much out of it. The first point — that dwindling attendance would suggest a weakened position — is certainly of concern but is exceedingly pessimistic and defeatist coming from union organizers. The very role of an organizer is to galvanize workers to become active participants in their workplace, and this includes getting them to show up to bargaining sessions. Union organizers are right to be concerned about dwindling support. However, the solution is to redouble efforts to increase participation, not to close off avenues to participation. A more optimistic perspective would be to recognize that high attendance by the rank and file will empower and energize the BC to stand up to the administration and fight for the most favorable contract possible. The second point — that a vocal minority could sabotage bargaining — could also be interpreted as pessimistic, insofar as it suggests that the rank and file cannot be trusted to behave with civility in the negotiating room. While the BC has provided no examples of negotiations that were sabotaged by unruly workers under open bargaining, there are a plethora of examples of successful open bargaining at other workplaces. In a recent white paper by veteran labor organizer Jane McAlevey entitledTurning the Tables: Participation and Power in Negotiations, McAlevey, while extolling the virtues of open bargaining, recounts first-hand experiences with it across a number of diverse workplaces, where ground rules are set to ensure that negotiations proceed in an efficient and civil manner. Workers are typically required to agree to four ground rules before entering the room: 1 maintain a “poker face,” as in show no emotion or other response, unless pre-planned; 2 no one speaks except the designated negotiators, unless pre-planned; 3 workers send notes on index cards to the negotiators whenever they want to speak, relay information, or take a break; and 4 no pictures, recordings or cell phone use. McAlevey claims: “In 20 years of big and open negotiations, I’ve never seen a worker violate the rules.” As to the BC’s final point — that grad students won’t get much out of attending open bargaining sessions — McAlevey has much to say to the contrary. Attendance by the rank and file builds trust between them and the BC. Transmitting information to the members about bargaining becomes much easier when they are able to witness the proceedings for themselves. Workers gain a greater sense of agency and belonging in the union when they are able to participate, even if only by sitting and observing, and gain a greater understanding of and appreciation for the inner workings of their union. And, finally, open bargaining gives workers first-hand experience of the nature of labor relations, where they can monitor the behavior and disposition of their employer and oftentimes observe the condescension and bad faith they exhibit towards their workers. But open bargaining is not just enacted successfully by the Philadelphia nurses or New Jersey teachers from McAlevey’s case studies; it is also used by our peers at other universities. Organizers for the Graduate Student Organizing Committee at New York University (NYU , the oldest private university grad student union in the country,have statedthat open bargaining sessions have been “instrumental in bringing people in” and “the experience of witnessing, even on Zoom, the dismissal and condescension that we face at the bargaining table is radicalizing and mobilizing.” Similarly,organizers from Student Workers of Columbia describehow the pandemic led to a flourishing of “rank-and-file participation and radicalization,” such as making their already-open bargaining sessions more accessible to the average member. This included moving sessions to more accessible locations and times, as well as offering remote attendance options. The histories of the unions at NYU and Columbia, as well as at the University of California system, are particularly instructive, where reform caucuses calledAcademic Workers for a Democratic Unionhave been formed to promote more open, democratic structures in response to the closed, top-down structures of their union leadership. Regardless of one’s position on open bargaining, we all ought to be troubled by the lack of democratic control over important strategic decisions within our union. Compare the lack of meaningful deliberation by the GSU on open bargaining with the GSU’s deliberation and decision-making on another consequential issue, the decision over which national union to affiliate with in Fall 2019. In the weeks leading up to that decision, the issue was researched extensively by a dedicated committee, of which I was a member. This committee then wrote a detailed report that weighed each option and was circulated to the membership, a town hall meeting was held that was open to all members to discuss the importance of the affiliation decision and the merits of each national union we were considering, and a secure online vote was conducted that was open to all members (since we weren’t public at the time, this generally included any graduate student who was supportive of the union . While this process was by no means perfect, it remains the closest instance of participatory democracy in the brief history of the union. There is no reason why a similar decision-making process could not be replicated, in part or in total, for deciding other important issues like the structure of our first negotiations with the administration. Unfortunately, the GSU has since rejected holding town hall meetings that are open to all graduate students for the purpose of discussing important issues, instead preferring to communicate almost exclusively through one-on-one conversations between union organizers and graduate students, such as in the lead up to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB election last Spring, and through departmental-level meetings. The arguments given against providing open town halls were similar to those arrayed against open bargaining: that they would provide a platform for a vocal minority of bad faith actors. Unfortunately, in my experience in the union, there is often a conflation of anti-union sentiment, on the one hand, and criticism and dissent by concerned members on the other. This philosophy of restricting discussion about the union to small, interpersonal exchanges between organizers and members within individual departments dictates the strategy for keeping members informed on bargaining: a Contract Action Team is charged with providing updates to constituents about what is going on during negotiations behind closed doors. While this kind of relational organizing is critical, and much lauded by experts like McAlevey, it should be coupled with efforts to provide open forums where members can access union leadership directly, and provide input, and obtain answers to questions, on important strategic topics. The benefits of open forums are many-fold: they allow the cross-pollination of ideas and the building of solidarity between like-minded individuals and departments, and they provide an outlet for constructive criticism of our union and an opportunity to hold leadership accountable. The importance of such meetings is laid out explicitly in a pamphlet from our national union partner, the UE, calledThem and Us Unionism: “High levels of membership participation are encouraged and made possible by the structure of our local unions. Regular membership meetings are held where the rank and file acts on all matters affecting the operation of the local.” Indeed, the GSU’s Affiliation Committee recommended affiliating with UE in large part for this emphasis on rank-and-file unionism in which, as the UE motto states, members run the union. In understanding what Union Democracy means, we can do no better than the description given in this same UE pamphlet: “Democracy is more than just holding votes — it is an active commitment to make sure that as many members as possible are informed and participating in their union. High levels of membership participation, and the willingness of UE members to stand up for a union that they control, is what allows us to keep our organization independent of the bosses.” In voting “yes” in the NLRB election and voting for union representatives, student-workers were not agreeing to give up their democratic rights and sit on the sidelines until they are needed to ratify a contract or authorize a strike. Democracy is not best realized through elected representatives who act on our behalf, but rather through the active participation of all of us. A top-down, undemocratic union that views its relationship with the rank and file transactionally, where promises can be made to garner support and votes in the short-term and then rescinded unilaterally and non-transparently, only hurts the workers that it professes to represent.

ubyssey_2022_19,"July 5, 2022 Written byDaphnée Lévesque Lately, I’ve been reflecting on what beginnings and endings mean to me. I started writingMind Your Mindduring my first year of university. I wanted to get involved with the student newspaper, and the opinion editor at the time was looking for someone to write about wellness. I knew plenty about illness, and therefore, knew plenty about managing one’s wellness. My editor, Jo, invited me to take risks in my writing, and she was the reason I began writing forThe Ubysseyin the first place. They convinced me not to quit many, many times. When I was ready to give up and complained about never being able to write another article, which was pretty much every other week, they sat me down and told me to breathe. They expressed their faith in me both as a writer and person. “But I can’t do it,” I’d wail. So, then she’d offer me a cookie, tell me once more to breathe and I never left her desk until we had come up with a new idea, plan or first draft. Over the past seven years, I’ve learned to cherishMind Your Mindwith all my heart. Writing was healing for me, but I also hope that my articles have helped others over the years. Sharing the insights I gained over the past few years with my peers has always been an important mission of mine. But like the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. So, it is with a heavy heart but wise mind thatMind Your Mindwill be retiring this year. It fills me with deep sadness, but I’m also hopeful that another UBC student will take a leap of faith and start their own wellness column. I hope that this person will embrace the process as much as I have, and I hope that they will find their voice and share their insights with the rest of the UBC community. I will miss writingMind Your Mindso much, but I acknowledge that it is time for me to move on. I have other writing projects in mind, including a potential memoir and perhaps someday, a young adult novel. After writing about mental health and wellness for so long, there is only so much more I can say. But, I know that mental health should be treated just like physical health. That is certain. I wish I could say that recovery is linear, that things get better overtime, and that one prescription or therapy session is all that’s needed. But that’s simply not true. I do know that we live in a depressing and beautiful world. We suffer immensely and care desperately. We have each other to lean on, and the power to stand on our own. And to you reading this, your experiences, as a human being, are 100 per cent valid. It doesn’t matter if other people believe your feelings are ‘too big’ or your emotions ‘too intense.’ Feeling your feelings is so brave, and emotional experiences can hurt so much sometimes. I know that living with ongoing mental illness can feel like living with a constant headache and heartache. I hope thatMind Your Mindhas brought you comfort on sad days and that it has provided you with valuable information. I hope that you continue to reach out for help, or begin to do so if that’s the next step for you. I hope you know that you can hold space for yourself, and that you are resilient and worthy. Thank you for reading, and for all the support over the past few years. Of course, a last shout out to the amazing opinion editors atThe Ubyssey, past and present. I wish you all the best.

crimson_2022_5,"Until it admits the Class of 2030, Harvard willno longer requireapplicants to submit standardized testing. For some, this decision is cause for celebration, a rare victory for equity in the “Evil Empire” of college admissions. Critics rightly point out that the SAT isunfairly wealth-biased, skewed byprivate schoolsandprivate tutorsin favor of the well-off. Asmallergroup sees this as a loss for equity. Against the backdrop of an admissions system characterized bybackdoors for the uber-wealthy, front doors for thosewith the meansto build an impressive resume, and ared carpet for legacies, the SAT — if imperfect — offers a comfortingly simple way for applicants to perform well and know they will be rewarded. Standardized testing is only a middling heuristic for ability, sure, but members of the pro-testing camp argue that it at least makes it hard for Harvard to accept a billionaire’s kid with a 900 on the SAT. But the problem is not that there are too few trust-fund kids with decent SAT scores for Harvard to accept — it’s that there are too many. A lifetime of accumulated privileges ensures that the applicants with the most money also tend to be those with the best scores. There are few billionaire’s kids with 900s on the SAT. Besides, they already have plenty of backdoors, likethe Z-list, a hush-hush group of mostly white, very wealthy applicants with underwhelming academics whom Harvard guarantees admission on the condition that they take a gap year. Even so, let’s assume for a moment that this policy change will allow a few more underperforming billionaires’ kids to slip through. So what? It would be unfair, sure. But a few questionable acceptances on the margins could not even begin to rival the far vaster economic injustice at the heart of Harvard: that67 percent of its studentscome from the top 20 percent of the income distribution. The SAT, while inequitable, has nothing to do with this. In every single element of the college application, wealth puts you ahead. Take the personal essay. Wealthy applicants attend elite private schools with rigorous humanities curricula that teach you how to write. They have well-educated parents who read their work and older peers who tell them what sort of essay gained them admission. They have a crack team of tutors and college admissions counselors who polish every line and, better yet, strategize with them from the beginning of high school to develop unique interests that they can later write about. How about extracurriculars? Well, the sort of great schools these kids attend also have great teams, clubs, and publications. Successful parents have successful friends whom their children can follow around for a few summer weeks and call it aninternship. And, of course, that same advising crack team can help them doll it all up in a 150-character description on the Common App. Yes, the SAT is wealth-biased, but so is nearly every other part of the college application. So is life. No metric can see through the privilege of a childhood spent soaked in opportunity to reveal some inherent, universally comparable degree of merit. Those who seek to make the college admissions process fairer in advocating for one metric over another — tests, essays, interviews — misplace their hope in inputs to a system that is structurally unfair. And in arguing over standardized tests, they relocate the responsibility to create a fairer college admissions process away from those doing the admitting. The blame lies solely with Harvard. This University speaks often of how diversity enriches our learning environment. And it is right — the myriad backgrounds, cultures, and experiences of its students are the greatest thing about this school. The University just doesn’t seem to believe this extends to class. As kaleidoscopically diverse as Harvard is, it is far less vibrant for its lack of low- and middle-income students. Without them, this student body remains siloed to the experiences of the better-off, seeing and hearing little of how most of this world lives. The diversity of experience we encounter remains, for the most part, a diversity of the wealthy. The “leaders of the future” Harvard says it trains will one day enter leadership positions with only abstract notions of what economic struggle is. This is how systems of economic unfairness remain and fester. If you believe in the promise of this University, if you think Harvard is a special place, it should strike you as a moral catastrophe that it nearly only accepts the wealthy. Surely Harvard doesn’t believe that67 percent of its best applicantscome from the same income bracket. The solution, I think, is simple: if Harvard cares about diversity of perspective, about being a place for ordinary people, and about being plain old fair, it must drastically alter how it accounts for wealth in admissions. Just as it gives applicants a“tip” for race, Harvard should give a comparably large boost for class, one carefully designed to come as close to economic parity as practicably possible. Until it does so, no standardized test — fair or not — will change the fact that this school was built as and chooses to remain a place for the wealthy.

state_press_2022_71,"The ASU administration should not have waited this long to let Edwards go. Edwards should not have been the coach going into this football season in the first place. Herm Edwards arrived at ASU in 2018 with aspirations to be relevant in the Pac-12, and he ended his coaching tenure with an embarrassing loss to a 20.5 pointunderdog team at home. Last Saturday night, Eastern Michigan simply looked like the better team, fanning the flames of ASU at Sun Devil Stadium 30-21. It was a rather stunning defeat after ASU played aclose gameinto the fourth quarter at Oklahoma State on Sept. 10th, but the result against Eastern Michigan is what matters the most. There is no way to accept losing to an underdog opponent from the Mid-American Conference. However, the ASU administration should not have waited this long to let Edwards go. Edwards should not have been the coach going into this football season in the first place. READ MORE:Herm Edwards out as football head coach In 2021, ASU announced that the NCAA had kicked off aninvestigationinto the football program, leading to multiple coaches either resigning or being fired and 17 playersentering thetransfer portal. The ongoing investigation concerns ASU recruiting high school football players during the COVID-19 dead period in 2020. The 17 players that entered the transfer portal included star quarterback Jayden Daniels, who transferred to LSU for the 2022-2023 college football season. Offensive coordinator Zak Hill and defensive coordinator Antonio Pierceboth resignedfollowing the news of the investigation. ASU ended uphaving the103rd best-recruiting classin 2022 following the news of the investigation, which was worse than schools like Wyoming, Toledo and San Jose State. Eastern Michigan placed 128th. For a football program that would love to consider itself a top-of-the-pack school in the Pac-12, these are extreme lows to allow from a head coach going into a football season. But even if we ignore the investigation and the fallout that came from it, the on-the-field results from the Edwards era were still not up to the necessary standard. Edwards won onlyone bowl gamethroughout his time at ASU, and he never competed in a Pac-12 championship game. His teams were often highly penalized; ASU finished with the fifth-most penalties per game last season. Chris Karpman, the publisher of Sun Devil Source for 247Sports, described Edwards as being “like a parent who let his kids get away with a little too much.” After ASU’s loss against Eastern Michigan, graduate student and quarterback Emory Jonessaid, “The whole week, the team overall, we weren’t locked into the little details.” The lack of discipline and preparation that Karpman and Jones hinted at is not at all up to par for a head coach of a Power Five football team. If this has been the norm for Edwards throughout his time at ASU, as seems to be apparent, I am shocked that the team won as many games as it did. It leaves me wondering if ASU would have won more games under a high-quality football coach. Karpman spoke to the potential that ASU had, saying that he believed the team’s talent was on par with good college football teams, particularly in 2021. Yet, Edwards was not able to turn in any results. Luckily, ASU administration finally decided to move on from Edwards. But we will always be left wondering what could have been.

crimson_2022_104,"In the past 24 years, Roncalli High School gave out more thantwo million canned fooditems for the needy. The Class of 2021 performed more than40,000 hours of public service. Last year was Roncalli’s first-ever “R Family day” celebrating the diversity of Roncalli students, with19 percentof students displaying their diverse backgrounds. Roncalli participates in theIndiana Choice Scholarshipwhich allows primarily low-income families to choose what school their children attend; this scholarship allowed my family to attend Roncalli free of cost when tuition is more than$10,000. This reputation of exceptional performance is accompanied by an equally exceptional history. A yearbook from 1987 tells of a general named“Ronnie Rebel”holding Confederate battle flags — or as the school once called them, “rebel flags.” The Rebels, and their implied ties to the Confederacy, continued to represent our school for several decades. However, researching Roncalli’s extraordinary history doesn’t require digging through an archive — just a quick Google search. I was a freshman in high school when Roncalli fired twogay counselors— Shelly Fitzgerald and Lynn Starkey — after finding out about their long-term marriages. InStarkey’s lawsuit, she provided evidence of a hostile environment towards gay students and faculty members. Student Dominic Conover, founder of Shelly’s Voice Advocacy Group, was told he would beunable to receive his diplomaif he continued to use his voice to supportFitzgerald; Fitzgerald’s father was similarly preventedfrom volunteeringat the school due to his support for Fitzgerald. Even as another localCatholic high schoolrefused to fire Layton Payne-Elliott, a teacher in a same-sex marriage, Roncalli held strong to the firings. Roncalli also allegedly threatened suspension to those vocalizing support for the BGLTQ community,silenced gay studentsand even allegedlydemanded additional tuition payments from vocal students. In my sophomore year, the Roncalli High Schoolprincipal used the N-wordat an all-school assembly. All Roncalli students, Roncalli teachers, and eventually, Roncalli families heard the principal say the N-word. Even more shocking was when former Roncalli teacher and coach, Jerre McManama Jr. responded to the scandal with: “Say the word. We’re not walking on eggshells here.” Junior year was marked by anincidentof football players hazing a student with Down syndrome, forcing them to lick someone’s nipple. What did the players do the following day? Play football. That was followed by a teacher (previously honored with a football field named after him allegedlyassaultinga student in the cafeteria. In my senior year, Roncallichanged its nicknamefrom “Rebels” to “Royals” due to the ties that Roncalli had to the Confederacy. The name was met with mixed reviews. Reverend Robert J. Robeson, Interim President of Roncalli in 2021, stated inRoncalli’s winter magazine: “M any … do not understand the nickname and see it as a symbol of the Confederacy and associate it with slavery and oppression.” He acknowledged that “Rebels carries with it some deep and hurtful associations for a great many people in our society — regardless of how we understand it.” He stated that changing the name would make others feel closer to Roncalli. In addition to this important change to Roncalli’s identity, that year, Roncalli demonstrated a commitment to inclusivity within Indianapolis’ diverse community, after the death ofGeorge Floyd and Breonna Taylor. A year after my time at Roncalli, a photo posted on the “roncallirowdies” Instagram depicted several Roncalli students next to signs of the letter K. Some, unaware of a pre-existing tradition inbaseballin which strikes are counted using “K”s, labeled the photo as a joke to create controversy. As a Roncalli student stated, “now it looks like a huge kkk rally instead of a high school softball game … it’s a wall of white students and k’s.” Roncallirowdies explained that the post was simply an expression of a pre-existing tradition and didn’t intend, or believe, that the post was connected to the KKK. A current sophomore at Roncalli stated that “if any other school or team did this … no one would care” — implying that Roncalli s identity is the reason people reacted negatively. The issue isn’t with the tradition, just as the word “Rebel” in itself isn’t a word that has been limited in usage (unlike other words used by the former principal of Roncalli . Roncalli, much like Harvard, has an exceptional history, tainted with imprints of the Confederacy, discrimination, and racism. When our school holds up “K”s, much of the Roncalli community, primarily underrepresented minorities, doesn’t see a tradition. To acknowledge our complex history and the positive changes that Roncalli has made despite it, Roncalli — just like Harvard — must firmly establish that, because it is exceptional, some traditions and practices must be discontinued or modified. Roncalli’s greatest challenge is to hear the voices that it has silenced throughout its history, including the increasing number of students of different racial, sexual, and economic backgrounds. Listen to us when all we see is “KKK — KKK — KKK.” Coby Y. Garcia ’25 lives in Grays Hall."
thetech_mit_2022_24,"Graduate student workers at the MIT-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program (MIT-WHOI decided overwhelmingly to unionize when a huge majority of us signed union cards over the last few weeks. After seeing what unionization did for my community growing up, I am confident unionization can be a tool for building a graduate experience of greater stability, security, and support for all of us, regardless of our backgrounds. I arrived at WHOI as a first-gen student in 2020, 3,000 miles away from my friends and family, in the middle of a global pandemic and a national reckoning with police brutality and institutional racism. As I tried to find my bearings in an unfamiliar environment, feeling isolated and insecure, I came across astatistic on graduate student attrition rates(rates at which students leave the program without a degree in the earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences (EAPS department: a shocking 25% average and an incredibly disheartening 42% for under-represented minorities like myself. I then realized that I felt not only isolated and insecure but also completely powerless to do anything about it on my own. These sentiments deepened when I took part in departmental diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI discussions on racism in academia, where I noticed that although my life experiences were useful contributions to the conversation, they alone were nothing when stacked against the institutional legacies and cultures that maintained the status quo. Despite all of the rhetoric and emails on DEI, I didn’t see anything changing to give people like me the support we needed. It wasn’t until I got involved in building our union that I felt welcome at MIT. For context, I grew up in a relatively small town adjacent to the Port of Los Angeles called San Pedro. Much of my community is working class and non-academic — hardly any of the adults I looked up to as a kid had a college degree. The only doctor I knew was my pediatrician, and yet my community was full of families of diverse ethnicities who lived with dignity, with the means to support themselves and each other. The reason for this? A strong union. Walk in any direction in San Pedro and you are bound to see union posters in the windows of small businesses and houses:“We support the ILWU & they support US!”Many members of my family are part of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 13. They work tirelessly every day to move thousands of shipping containers full of goods through the largest port in the country. Since the 1930s,their unionhas been “dedicated to the idea that solidarity with other workers and other unions is the key to achieving economic security and a peaceful world.” Join them at the dinner table or downtown at the bar and you would hear conversation on topics ranging from the next jobs coming in to the union meeting coming up later that night or the upcoming contract fight with the Pacific Maritime Association. Parked outside, you might see a family SUV with a window decal declaring “Union Strong,” “An Injury to One is an Injury to All,” or (I finally understand this one now “Organize or Die.” Of course, being a worker in a union is more than aesthetics and talk. What was clear to me was that the adults who I looked up to had agency in their workplace and that they were proud because this meant that their families had intrinsic access to good healthcare, vacation time, school supplies, housing, and every other basic material need that a family needs to thrive. Whenever a contract expired and those things came under attack, they didn’t have to beg for better working conditions because they weren’t alone in fighting for their dignity as workers — not only did they have each other, but they had the broader community backing them as well. Unfortunately, only a small portion of workers in San Pedro were unionized when I was growing up, so many did not experience the security my family did. Like almost all Black and brown working class neighborhoods in the country, ours was not unfamiliar with the issues of poverty, addiction, housing and job insecurity, police harassment and violence, underfunded public education, and so much more. While I made it to MIT, I have had many friends who I know are just as deserving of such an education but simply faced too many obstacles along the way. I can say with confidence that without growing up in a union family and the stability it offered us, I would likely not be here today. Even so, making it all the way to graduate school was a struggle. I often think about the EAPS attrition statistic referenced above and how often I have come close to personally contributing to it were it not for a bit of luck. After using up my savings to make the cross-country move, I struggled to find housing that I could afford on my stipend for my partner and myself. I don’t know what we would have done had someone reasonable not answered our desperate, urgent Craigslist ad for housing. Like many other first-gen grad students, my family was in no position to assist me, financially or otherwise. Immediately, I found myself alone in having to learn how to adapt to an environment characterized by individualism, prestige, affluence, and whiteness (both within the institution and outside of it . I felt extremely isolated, and my mental health plummeted as a result. I chose to study the ocean at MIT and WHOI because the ocean has always played a significant part in my life. I know many other kids who grew up like me would love to do the same, would have so much to contribute to the future of marine science as well as the strength of their communities at home. It doesn’t need to be like this. Why should we have to rely on luck to be successful even after we make it through the trials of academia and into a grad program? Why should we have to beg administrators to take into account our experiences, to prioritize the things we know we need to survive in this environment? We know that WHOI and MIT say they are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. However, we do not know if they are actually in a position to listen seriously to their most marginalized and vulnerable workers. Like with the ILWU workers from my home community, our union gives us a vehicle to stand in support of each other as graduate student workers of many different backgrounds, advantages, and disadvantages. We can fight to guarantee all grad workers at WHOI live a dignified and comfortable life, where our needs are met and we are treated with respect, so we can focus on our academic and research goals. Together we can sit down at the table with the administration and make sure not one of our voices is left out and discounted. Together we can make WHOI an institution that is truly welcoming of everyone. We all have a story, and we’re all in this together. Join your fellow graduate student workers bysigning a union cardand sharing your story today!

All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. During this primary election season, we are undoubtedly aware of the high profile candidates running for office. However, there are countless more local and statewide races that are going to appear on our ballots — all of them crucial elected positions that will form the ballot we will vote on in November. Each time we vote, we shape the policies, ideas and experiences that are brought to the table for our city, county and state. These candidates are the people who will directly determine what life looks like for Rice University and the Houstonians surrounding us — in terms of criminal justice, voter suppression and civil rights. Early voting in the primaries has already begun, and will last till Feb. 25 (this Friday , and the closest polling location is located in the first floor of the John P. McGovern building in the Med Center. March 1, this upcoming Tuesday, will be the general election day and polling will be held in the Grand Hall of the RMC — making voting as easy as stopping by the RMC with your driver’s license, personal state-issued ID or passport in hand. Texas has what is called an open primary; this means that when you get to the voting station, you will have the opportunity to decide which party’s slate of candidates you want to vote for (Democrat or Republican , regardless of how you registered to vote. This means that you have the opportunity to help select the candidates of the party you arenotaffiliated with, opening up new voting possibilities in the general election. This gives you immense opportunity to research a wide plethora of candidates with ranging views and beliefs, and find the ones who best represent your vision for the future of Harris County and Texas. That is why it is of utmost importance to create an informed voting plan and take the time to participate in early voting or general election day voting this primary season, for down-ballot candidates and high-profile races alike. This upcoming election, especially in the field of down-ballot candidates (such as judges, county commissioners and state representatives , the policies that are brought to the table can impact Harris County’s criminal justice, civil rights and environmental future. We should not discount the importance of the primaries on the notion that the results are pre-determined, or based on the supposition that it is only the general election that has material impact. Especially with the low profile races, your vote will have a large material impact on who appears on the general election ballot. The sheer number of races in play this year, especially in highly specific down-ballot roles such as land commissioner, who manages infrastructure funding and planning; the Texas Railroad Commission, who controls natural gas production and is partially responsible for the energy grid fiasco of last year; or judges, who determine the future of restorative justice initiatives. This means that there are several candidates who are new to the field but have innovative and interesting ideas that we might hope to see brought to a general election in order to spark new conversations. The only way to have these conversations is if we vote for the candidates whose ideas we believe in during the primaries. We’ve highly encouraged you to research, but how do you actually learn about the candidates in these positions? To get informed, you can look upsample ballotsfor your county and use sources likeBallotpediato see candidates’ platforms and donations. You can check out their campaign website for a list of endorsements, which are often telling of policy priorities. At the very least, you can look at official released recommendations andvoter guidesfrom trusted sources, such as the Houston Chronicle. If we hope to continue Houston s precedent of innovative policies, we need to take the time to research the candidates running for these positions of power; ignoring down-ballot candidates or electing candidates who are not representative of your best wishes for our county could delay comprehensive political action for years to come.

crimson_2022_56,"Well, damn. Look at us now. “Strangers with memories” or whatever dramatic quote we’ll retweet on Twitter. I’ve had quite the lifetime of experiences with breakups: a total of four over six years. Still wondering if I’ll end up with an average of one breakup a year. Each of them was a different type of hurt, a different type of person, and a different version of love — if you could call it that. For those lucky enough to have never experienced a breakup, they suck. They’re horrendous. You hear those classic last words or see those three little text bubbles, your aching heart sinks to the bottom of your toes, and before you know it, your life is fundamentally derailed from the course it was on previously. I hate heartbreaks, but I don’t hate love. I haven’t yet become that Neuroscience concentrator who believes that love is only neurons firing in association with a person or feeling. I haven’t yet become a cynic who argues there’s no point to falling in love when it could all end in a matter of seconds, words, or texts. Every time I’ve had to hear those relationship-ending words, I’ve had to ask myself: was it worth it? Was the breakup worth all the memories the two of you made together? Was it worth sharing each and every one of your dreams and goals with each other? Was all of it together, the euphoric relationship and the devastating breakup, the rise and the fall, the highs and the lows, worth it? It was worth it. Despite all the tears I shed, I wouldn’t have had this little ol’ heart of mine crushed any other way. My breakups made me into the person I am today. My heartbreaks taught me how to handle the loss of a best friend. They taught me how to differentiate between being appreciated and being spared the bare minimum. They taught me that individual lives sometimes just don’t line up, no matter how hard you try to fit the puzzle pieces together. Sometimes, I wish I could have just read the paragraph above and taken my word for it. I wish I could have known these lessons in advance — but I’m glad I learned it through you, all the girls I’ve loved before. I’m glad I had the chance to watch you sing at your recital. I’m glad we watched those hot air balloons in the sky. I’m glad I asked you out with no time left. I’m glad I cooked that fancy dinner with the cheesy music on just for you. This Valentine’s Day, for the first time in a very long time, I won’t have a card, chocolates, or even roses to buy for that someone special in my life. And I’m okay with it. I’ll have the lessons you taught me to carry with me to make the day special. So to all the girls who broke my heart: I hope that you find someone closer to home who can see you any day of the week and give you a rose on each one of those days. I hope that you find what truly makes you happy. I hope that you find that adventure in Italy, Greece, France, or Mars. I hope that you find someone that completes your puzzle, even if that somebody isn’t me. But most importantly, I hope that you all have a wonderful Valentine’s Day without me. And to all the future girls that may or may not break my heart: let me down easy. It’s Valentine’s Day, after all. Your ex- (or future Valentine, Markus Anzaldua-Campos Markus I.

wildcat_arizona_2022_87,"When people think of the “college experience,” oftentimes the first things that come to mind are beer bongs and shots of cheap vodka on a Saturday night. With that comes people’s negative stereotypes of fraternity parties and Greek Life. I hear people say all the time that students in sororities or fraternities are more concerned about when the next party is than they are about their seven-page paper due Monday morning. Because of this stigma around party culture, the numerous benefits of the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Association are frequently overlooked. There are many aspects of being part of a sorority or fraternity that are hard to see from the outside. For example, the greek community focuses heavily on community service and philanthropic involvement with the events each house organizes every semester. What many people don’t know is that each fraternity and sorority supports a specific cause and thousands of dollars are raised each year for organizations like Girls on the Run, Alzheimer’s Association, Ronald McDonald House and so many more. When I was coming into college, getting involved through Greek Life was something that really appealed to me because I knew I would have the opportunity to give back to my community and be part of something bigger than myself. After only one semester at the University of Arizona, I feel that sense of community more than ever. Every house supports one another by showing up to events and contributing to these philanthropic fundraisers. “Participating in other chapters’ philanthropy events and events around Tucson was one of my favorite things in the entire world,” said Devin Douglas, former president of the sorority Gamma Phi Beta. “It’s so fun being able to do activities that simultaneously benefit philanthropies. You’re having fun while raising money for a great cause; it’s one of those things that really brings everybody together.” The organization and turnaround time that the greek chapters achieve with their events is extremely impressive, especially since all the houses are run by a group of full-time students mostly under the age of 22. This leads to the many leadership opportunities that are offered by each chapter, which teach members vital skills that they can carry into their professional life. Reflecting on her time as chapter president, Douglas connected the similarities that running a sorority has to running a business. “You have to make sure you’re spending wisely and you’re handling your members wisely. You learn how to interact with a very wide range of people and how to handle different situations,” Douglas said. This experience is something that will benefit young adults in any career they choose after college. Learning how to work under pressure and making challenging decisions at a young age are skills fraternity and sorority members are lucky to gain. The sense of togetherness within all the greek chapters is another thing I noticed right away. People join a sorority or fraternity because they want to find like-minded people to spend their time with. Jackson Byrne, a freshman pre-business student, just joined the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and talked about the time he spends with his brothers. “There are times because you’re in the same house people would feel like you have to hang out with them, but every day we choose to hang out with each other outside of the house,” Byrne said. This does not just include partying either. Byrne said members of the fraternity spend time studying together in the library, pushing each other in the gym and grabbing a bite to eat on University Boulevard. Because of this, you can build a strong bond with everyone in your chapter, outside of the loud party scene. Above all else, the most beneficial aspect of joining Greek Life is the plethora of academic support given by not only the individual chapters but the IFC and Panhellenic Association as a whole. Each chapter holds its members to a high academic standard, such as maintaining a high GPA and participating in study hours and there are specific steps that must be taken if that standard is not met. Jenna Hartman, a freshman pre-business student in Kappa Kappa Gamma, is part of the academic board for her chapter. Her role is to meet with members who are falling below Kappa’s GPA requirement and create an academic progress plan for each member. The sole purpose of this is to provide extra help to the women of the sorority so they can thrive academically. “Greek Life has a lot of extra resources that I would not be aware of if I was not in it,” Hartman said. This is because when you are connected to so many people with the same goal, you have access to support you would otherwise have to seek out. After having such a positive experience being part of the greek community, I would encourage anyone who has thought about joining but didn’t, to give it a chance. Once you look past the stereotypes of Greek Life, you can better understand that there is a lot more to being part of a sorority or fraternity than partying. Community involvement, leadership development and academic support are just the beginning.

stanforddaily_2022_92,"I am Ukrainian, one of 15 Ukrainian students at Stanford, whose families are in Ukraine. Every day is an existential threat to everything I love. My heart is filled with fear, anxiety and devastation. But I choose action, action over silence and helplessness, and encourage the global community to do the same. I was born in the city of Dnipro. City of one million, where Jews, Armenians, Arabs and lately students from across the world find peace in the sovereign land of Ukraine. I dream of hugging my family, healthy and smiling. And there will be a peaceful sky above a free and strong Ukraine. Currently, my elderly grandparents are shuttling among bunkers and unlivable basements. My aunt’s family is in Kharkiv; last time she spoke with my mom, they had been sitting in the basement for seven days. Firefights and grad missile attacks that we see in the media are happening just outside of their house, all the time. Our closest family friend, the best man at our wedding, Stas, has joined the territorial defense, a volunteer defense group in Vinnitsya. He is an entrepreneur, husband and father; he has no military experience. His wife and son are now in Poland. They were devastated and sobbed on the phone, “We cannot believe this is happening.” On Monday, eight missiles destroyed Vinnistya’s airport. Our friend Stas is alive. Nine people, including five civilians, have died. Every message or phone call is precious. Local crowdsourced group chats on Telegram have become a lifeline. Approximately 500 messages per day, 24/7, from all over Ukraine, notify about attacks, explosions and fires, ruined buildings and destroyed military vehicles, captives, casualties. These messages also build hope by showing the unparalleled heroism of Ukrainians and transmitting President Zelensky’s courageous speeches. At Stanford, I’ve helped organize a community of Ukrainians, now consisting of more than 20 permanent members with 200 volunteers. Since news of the Russian invasion came on the evening of Feb. 23, we’ve built a websitewww.standwithukraine.howwith 100,000 visitors over the last five days. We’re driving initiatives on humanitarian aid, economic sanctions and better defense weapons. In less than 48 hours, our volunteer, veteran and med school student Josh Pickering secured 80 tons of medical supplies from Kaiser Permanente. He will soon bring them to the Poland-Ukraine border. We’re engaging young global leaders on the importance of their voices in restoring global peace. We’re reaching out to American celebrities of Ukrainian ancestry, such as Steven Spielberg, Leo DiCaprio and Sly Stallone. We are trying to convert helplessness into action. Part of me hopes this is all just a nightmare and I will awaken to a world where my country is merely fighting COVID, unemployment and corruption — not one of the most powerful armies anywhere. Meanwhile, I push forward. A month ago, I planned a Ukrainian party, aiming to share everything I love about my country with my classmates. The party last night became a rally and fundraising event. We were joined by more than 500 people, media and public figures, including Michael McFaul and Condoleezza Rice. Students from all around the world, including Russia, Belarus and Georgia, expressed their support and stood with us in a moment of silence. Hundreds of voices shouted, “Glory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes.” Russian students shouted, “Putin, go f*ck yourself.” I had been looking forward to this day. But I wish it never had to happen."
wildcat_arizona_2022_68,"Many of us have seen the big wooden cross displayed right in front of the University of Arizona Bookstore Starbucks. Beside it, a group of familiar faces hand out fake million dollar bills with images of Jesus Christ featured on the front. They hand out these bills eagerly and do not seem to care whether you accept their offer or not. They give us pamphlets anyway, describing all of the countless ways we are sinners. They smile and ask us if we think we are going to hell. Often, these questions make students visibly uncomfortable. Most of us are just trying to grab our iced coffee and get to class. Whether you are a Christian, a Buddhist or an atheist—it really doesn’t matter. The religious groups on campus often go way too far and their style of student outreach is both inappropriate and predatory. These groups target students—young people—who are more impressionable and susceptible to the harsh notions being pushed upon them. After receiving the infamous fake million dollar bill (after a few no thank you’s , I found its content to be particularly interesting. One particular highlight being the sentence “If I keep rejecting Jesus and choosing sin, it will lead me to hell forever.” No email, no church hours or any other useful information—just threatening sentences with empty meaning. With this, I am reminded of what feels like playground bullying. Do this, or I’m gonna tell the teacher! As I read this fake money, I cannot help but wonder what the benefits are for any respectable organization (religiously affiliated or not to scare and bully their audience into joining. The answer is short and simple—they don’t want to genuinely inform students of their beliefs, they want to manipulate them. After months of observing the way they approach students, it’s more than obvious most of these groups’ efforts are both systematic and strategic. It’s common knowledge that college students are shifting and changing every single day. We are all still figuring out who we are, what we want and what we believe in. At a time when most of our mindsaren’t even developed yet, this intense and manipulative way of speaking to students is unacceptable on campus. An excerpt from Freedom from Fear Magazine touches on how phobia indoctrination is anemotional control technique, typically relying on threats like “going to hell” or being judged for eternity. While this may seem extreme compared with the seemingly harmless groups we see on campus, it really is not too far from our reality. There is a reason why these specific religious groups and cults alike go about their outreach in a rather unconventional way—for the same reason they do it on college campuses instead of public parks. Unfortunately, their influence relies solely on fear and guilt tactics used in an attempt to herd in young and impressionable students. It is within human nature, especially in young people, to create some sort of a brand for ourselves. We seek labels, groups that we can belong to just for the sake of belonging to one. As a society, we have created an unsaid importance of fitting someplace, being a part of something. For the most part, this notion is almost entirely harmless. Whether it’s in GreekLife or clubs, students have a way to involve themselves with any organization that is of interest to them. This norm becomes problematic, however, when there are plenty of students who do not find themselves being able to place within any one of those groups. According to a sociologist in a Heather R. Hayes article, a group providessafety, security and comfort, a sometimes dangerous combination when mixed with the desire to belong that is so often synonymous with being young. It is unfortunate to think that these religious groups on campus know this, and continue to prey on students needing a sense of belonging the most. With this, I would encourage students here on campus to be mindful and aware of these kinds of groups on campus. Whether it’s evangelists or a club about saving puppies, no organization should try to scare you into joining. Follow Olivia Krupp onTwitter Olivia is a freshman who has yet to declare her major.

crimson_2022_153,"Haiti lies on the Latin American island of Hispaniola with its neighbor, the Dominican Republic. Naturally, when two countries border each other, migration occurs. Though there is an assumption that Haitian immigration to the Dominican Republic is a new development resulting from the country’s recent economic issues, it is not. Immigration in large numbers from Haiti to the Dominican Republic began in the 1930s, when many Haitians were transported to sugar cane plantations in the Dominican Republic to work low-wage jobs to boost the economy. The type of back-breaking work Haitian migrants did was often undesirable to Dominicans, as the sugar cane industry was slow and difficult. This influx of Haitian migrants led to several generations of Haitians being born on Dominican land before separation at the border started after theinhumane Parsley Massacreof 1937 — a genocide led by dictator Rafael Trujillo that claimed the lives of up to 20,000 Haitians — and for decades afterward. According to the 1929 Dominican Republic Constitution, people born in the Dominican Republic were automatically citizens, except those with parents considered “in transit,” such as diplomats and passing travelers. For decades, this definition of citizenship did include those with Haitian ancestry born in the Dominican Republic. However, in 2013, the Dominican Constitutional Court retroactively defined 20th-century Haitian immigrant workers as being “in transit,” therefore invalidating the citizenship of approximately 252,000 of their Haitian Dominican descendants. The term “in transit” cannot describe a dense group of people who established roots in a country over 70 years ago. It is unacceptable. The idea that Haitian workers would provide the labor to boost other economies for years, then pack up and “return” to a country they are culturally, economically, and socially removed from is ridiculous. Haitian workers should not expect to have their labor exploited and then be cast away after the hard work is over. These Haitian Dominicans were forced into statelessness by the Dominican government and faced deportation from the only home they had ever known. They were born in the Dominican Republic. They worked in the Dominican Republic. They paid taxes in the Dominican Republic. They got married and had children and grandchildren in the Dominican Republic. They are Dominican. And they are Hispanic. All Haitians are Latino bydefinitionbecause the term Latino “refers to those who are from or have a background in a Latin American country.” Haitian Dominicans are also Hispanic because the term Hispanic “refers to individuals who are Spanish-speaking or have a background in a Spanish-speaking country.” Being first-generation, second-generation, or even third-generation Haitian Dominican counts as having a background in a Spanish-speaking country. Many of them only communicate in Spanish and have no knowledge of Haitian Creole. Their lives were conducted in Spanish from birth. Haitian ancestry cannot disqualify these Dominicans from their Hispanic identity. It cannot eradicate their native tongue, Spanish, from their mouths. Likewise, it cannot remove decades of Hispanic culture and influence that many of them have experienced from the womb. Hispanic Heritage Month is for Haitian Dominicans. They cannot be forgotten when we celebrate Hispanic peoples. They are a part of the Hispanic diaspora, just like any other Dominican. How ludicrous would it be if I, a first-generation Haitian American, or any descendant of immigrants within the last centennial were told we are not American? It is our country of birth and where we call home. It would be completely insane to deny my claim to be American because my ancestors were not born here. It is no different for generational Haitian Dominicans. Where you are born and grow up heavily impacts who you are, what you believe, what you value, and more — in essence, your culture and nationality. To say that Haitian Dominicans have no right to claim their nationality is equivalent to stripping them of the right to claim their culture. The erasure of Black Hispanics in Hispanic culture is a trend that is far too common and should not persist. It is incredibly harmful to someone’s sense of self if their identity is invalidated for any reason, including having a darker skin color. Colonization has forced us to believe that the more African ancestry one has, the more disposable they are. But Haitian Dominicans are not disposable. They are not erasable. They are not exiles in their country of origin. They are Dominican. And they are Hispanic. Christina N. Chaperon ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Adams House.

state_press_2022_26,"ASU s parental leavepolicyallows employees a paid 12-week leave to allow for recovery from childbirth, and to care for the newborn, or newly adopted child. This policy can be used for new mothers, fathers and adoptive parents. At a glance, this policy seems more than adequate, especially when you consider the lack of federal policy we have to protect new parents. However, when you look at the bigger picture, and other nations, it becomes clear American parents need more support than they are getting from their workplaces. In the U.S. we ve seen major shifts in household structure. More mothers are working, 72% in 2018 compared to 51% in 1968,according to the Pew Research Center. Fathers are expected to take on more child care responsibilities along with working full time. Despite changes, policy in the U.S. has lagged behind. In astudyconducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, out of 41 countries studied, the U.S. ranked last in paid leave provided to new parents. The majority of nations studied gave new parents about 20 weeks of paid leave. The United States does not require paid parental leave from employers. The U.S. has theFamily and Medical Leave Act (FMLA , which requiresemployersto provide eligible employees with unpaid family leave. The problem with this is it may cut new parents off from the finances they may need. Low-income families need paid parental leave so they are able to support their newborn children. This issue is not distinct to ASU. In this country, our parental leave and parental support policies reflect the priorities of our government, said Elizabeth Anthony, an associate professor at the School of Social Work. Women and children, particularly low-income women and children, have not been a priority for quite some time. The benefits of offering paid family leave are not just financially beneficial to parents and families. A study from the National Partnership for Women and Families found providing workers with at least 12 weeks of paid leave would result in 600 fewer infant deaths per year. FMLA doesn t even cover everyone. About 44% ofemployeesare not eligible for unpaid family leave. Employees of small businesses, part-time workers and those who have been at their place of employment for less than a year are not eligible for unpaid family leave. The fact the U.S. still does not have paid parental leave and offers families the bare minimum shows our country is not keeping up with what its workers need. Asurveyby Asher & Lyric Fergusson ranked the U.S. one of the worst wealthy nations to raise a family in 2020. Nine states and Washington, D.C. provide paid family leave, however, two-thirds of the country s workforce do not live in a place where they are offered paid family leave. Arizona does not offer paid parental leave. Arizona is one of the fastest-growing states in the country,according to Phoenix Business Journal, so our need for paid leave is only going to increase as more people start families here. Part of me wants to commend ASU for offering its employees paid family leave in a state that does not require it. I think in this case, ASU is creating a good example other businesses should follow. I think we have this added benefit that we do receive 12 weeks parental leave, said Rizwana Biviji, a lecturer at the College of Health Solutions. Which is more than double than what some of the other employers are offering. Biviji gave birth to her daughter in July 2020 and found getting parental leave was a very smooth process. Although she did not receive the 12 weeks of paid leave, due to not having worked at ASU for 12 months, she is overall happy with the policy ASU offers. I m also happy it provides equal leave time to mothers and fathers, as well as adoptive parents and same-sex parents. This is a modern approach that benefits all family structures and doesn t put all child care responsibilities on the mother. At the same time, I still think the 12 weeks ASU offers, while it is a good start, is not enough when compared to other developed nations that offer twice as much time in paid parental leave. Despite being happy with her own experience at ASU, Biviji agrees some federal changes still need to be made. I do see that there is some work that needs to be done just based on advocacy efforts or policy efforts for a more federal movement towards increasing the maternity leave timespan, Biviji said. Some of the other countries, for example, my home country, India offers up to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, and most employers are required to offer that. Paid family leave is something that can benefit our nation s workers and parents, as well as ensure future generations are healthy and well cared for. It s obvious Arizona and the U.S. need to catch up with the times. Reach the columnist athtenore@asu.eduand follow@haleyyhmton Twitter.

crimson_2022_152,"Writing about the Hispanic identity is very difficult. That might be because it doesn’t exist. Maybe it’s just my Social Studies-esque “everything is discourse” sensibility talking, but regardless, I can’t help but notice that in the same way Foucault wrote “Before the end of the eighteenth century, man did not exist,” at Harvard, Hispanics don’t exist either. I’m not trying to make some vague postmodernist argument about the social construction of race. Maybe there really is some ideal “Hispanic” floating around somewhere in Platonic heaven. But here on Earth, what really matters to Hispanics at Harvard, myself included, is what people actually see as the Hispanic identity, and how it impacts our interactions on campus. It is in this sense that the Hispanic identity is a problem — so fractured, diverse, and ill-defined that for all intents and purposes, it doesn’t exist. The most obvious place where the Hispanic problem rears its head is in the mundane work of the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census questionnaire asks respondents to identify their race, presenting options for White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. “Hispanic” doesn’t make the list because the nature of Hispanicism encompasses various races. There are White Hispanics, Black Hispanics, and Asian Hispanics. Instead, the questionnaire asks in a separate question if the respondent identifies as Hispanic. This solution addresses the narrow problem faced by the Census Bureau — identifying Hispanics — but, in a broader sense, it exemplifies a failure to fully understand how Hispanics actually identify themselves. Many Cubans, for example, do not consider themselves Hispanic but rather Cuban-American, an identity meant to recognize a particular culture, history, and set of traditions distinct from that of other Hispanics in the U.S. Differences in racial self-identification further distinguish Cubans: In 2004, 86 percent of Cubans identified themselves as white on the Census, while only 50 percent of Puerto Ricans did the same. In general, Hispanics tend to identify much more with their country of origin than with the term Hispanic. According to Pew Research, only 24 percent of Hispanics use the terms Hispanic or Latino most often to describe their identity. Over half prefer instead to use their family’s country of origin to identify themselves. Go to any Hispanic event at Harvard and you’ll see this diversity of identities. There are international students who identify more with their home countries than they do with the Hispanic population on campus. There are second-generation immigrants who grew up speaking the Spanish of their parent’s home culture. There are other second-generation immigrants who found a place within a local American-Hispanic culture, and still others who are Black and Hispanic and must balance those two identities. Misguided attempts to generalize Hispanics into one ethno-racial group is what leads people to be surprised when they see the 32 percent of Hispanics who voted Republican in 2020. Some may see this fracturing of the Hispanic identity as a problem in light of issues with Hispanic representation on campus. In final clubs, for instance, the general consensus is that Hispanics are among the least represented groups. Some people hear mention of the “Black Fly” or a pipeline between Black Men’s Forum and final clubs and conclude that the answer to this lack of representation is to strengthen the institutional and social power of Hispanic affinity organizations, creating a strong, unified Hispanic identity on campus. Well-intentioned as they may be, calls to create a shared Hispanic identity at Harvard are misguided. Hegel believed that the definition of an identity requires opposition with an Other. Many times this definition is needed, but in this case, in creating a defined Hispanic identity, we risk distancing ourselves from the rest of the student body — all in pursuit of reifying a community that doesn’t need to exist. Instead of trying to construct a community to match the term Hispanic, we should embrace the differences between Hispanic identities and try to learn from one another. This is not to say that I don’t support the Hispanic affinity organizations on campus. People should embrace all those communities with which they identify; affinity organizations help them do just that. All I’m saying is that we should not lament the fact that Hispanics lack the social cohesion that other identities may have on campus. Instead, we should celebrate the differences between the Hispanic identities that make us who we are. For someone writing a piece about identity, I haven’t talked a lot about my own so far. Yes, I am Hispanic, but knowing that doesn’t tell you anything about me. Instead of knowing me as a Hispanic student, you should know me as the son of two Colombian immigrants, someone who only speaks Spanish at home, who grew up in Atlanta and visits their family in Colombia often. I am Hispanic, but before that, I am an individual, who, like many, has a story that cannot be generalized into one overarching identity. As Hispanic Heritage Month begins, I urge you to listen to the stories — in the Crimson’s pages and beyond — that define each of us. Reading them, you’ll see the differences that, paradoxically, are what make us all Hispanic. Manuel A. Yepes ’24, an Associate Editorial Editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Cabot House.

state_press_2022_27,"Dear State Press, you ve got mail. Illustration published on Friday, March 3, 2017. A recentopinion piecefrom The State Press expressed opposition to President Michael Crow’s salary as just approved by the Arizona Board of Regents. Let me speak for our Board in response. I appreciate that the author gives credit to Crow’s leadership moving ASU from a party school to a research powerhouse, keeping average student debt of an ASU graduateat approximately half of the national average and avoiding tuition increases. But the author then inexplicably treats these as accomplishments unworthy of justifying the president s salary. So let me broaden the picture. The net result is that more students, of broader diversity, have access to a degree, more ways to get it and at a lower cost. And most importantly, today s ASU degree will earn its graduates far more than it used to. It is worthwhile to point out that in 2021, 45% of undergraduates from ASU graduated with no debt, according to theABOR FY 21 Financial Aid Report. I suspect many students appreciate that and the leadership that brought us here. The framers backed the nearly free as possible commitment in the Arizona Constitution with a revenue provision later in the Constitution, which reads: The legislature shall make such appropriations, to be met by taxation, as shall insure the proper maintenance of all state educational institutions, and shall make such special appropriations as shall provide for their development and improvement. Read together, the framers intent is clear. Finally, the author cites the Charter and argues that ASU s responsibility to the community is more important than goals like student enrollment. Frankly, I can t think of a higher demonstration of ASU s responsibility to the community than growing student enrollment and degree attainment. Growing degree attainment changes family trajectory, broadens equitable opportunity, adds value to our workforce and economic value to our state. Arizona has among the lowest attainment rates in the country and a low-average family income. The economic correlation between degree attainment and economic growth is demonstrably well-established. But there s more. Today s ASU is conducting breakthrough research in areas from energy to healthcare to technology that will improve our lives. And the net result is literally billions of dollars in economic value to our region and state that didn t exist before. Crow is widely heralded as one of the most effective higher education leaders in the country, and I daresay the world. Recruiters knock on his door regularly with fat checkbooks. Both our state and our students are better off because the Regents retain him with a salary that reflects his worth in a very competitive marketplace for talent.

rice_thresher_2022_53,"Photo courtesy Gabrielle Franklin ByThresher Editorial Board2/22/22 11:35pm This year, two candidates with distinctly different approaches and areas of expertise are vying for the Student Association presidency. We, the Thresher Editorial Board, endorse Gabrielle Franklin for Student Association President because of her stances on accountability and fostering an inclusive environment for underrepresented students as well as actionable plans to do so. Franklin, current Brown College senator, is passionate about advocacy, and has past experience elevating vital and marginalized voices on campus. While her lack of experience on the executive team gives us some pause in her ability to hit the ground running, she is able to clearly articulate her stances on a range of issues as well as her plans and priorities for the office. One of Franklin’s goals is to revive lost internal SA meetings and better facilitate external communication, the latter of which she has worked on in her current position. In her interview with the Thresher editorial board, she discussed her ideas to establish secondary points of contact within the SA to prevent a loss of communication when someone is unavailable, ask executive members to connect with college governments and promote monthly meetings between all SA positions. Beyond that, her focus on proactive communication with student groups and providing detailed notes or recordings of meetings when unable to secure a meeting for interested groups with administration shows a flexibility in her approach while retaining her prioritization of student interests. Further, Franklin expressed her willingness to learn from other SA members about the inner workings of the organization. While she will come in with her own priorities for the incoming SA administration, she also prioritizes student feedback and opinion as evidenced by her willingness to directly collaborate with campus organizations to reach collective goals, such as with Rice PRIDE in response to recent issues regarding transphobia at Senate and with Questbridge to increase accessibility of resources for students facing food insecurity. Franklin’s opponent, current SA Internal Vice President Madison Bunting, possesses distinct attributes that also make her very qualified for the job. For instance, she has incredible knowledge of the ins and outs of the SA that makes her a strong candidate. However, Bunting refused to take a definitive stance on a number of issues, including handling conflict with administration and the limits on acceptable speech in the Senate. This refusal to take a stance wasn’t just a fluke, but rather a key part of her platform which centered on deferring to the student body on nearly every issue. Especially with low voting and polling turnout, it is not feasible to expect polling to provide the solution to all student issues. In the absence of well-rounded, complete polling data, or when the student body is split on an issue, a president is forced to take a stance that will influence the conversation within the SA and with the administration. In the end, we know where Franklin stands on the issues, which we believe to be a necessary quality in a president.

crimson_2022_57,"“They just set us back 10 years.” This would be an appropriate response to when Kanye West said slavery was “a choice” or when watching Christian Walker on TikTok. This is a phrase some Black folks use when we feel someone has embarrassed or humiliated the Black community. It may also be used in more casual situations, like if a Black person dances poorly in public or makes a joke that doesn’t land. In their actions, all the progress Black people have made over the years, cleaning up our reputation, was lost. I have often used this phrase jokingly, but in light of recent news I have realized the weight it holds. This month, three graduate students filed a lawsuit against Harvard for ignoring reported sexual assault claims about Professor John L. Comaroff over multiple years, including both physical and verbal harassment. He was put on paid administrative leaveback in 2020, and more recently wasplaced on unpaid leaveand can no longer advise any new graduate students. Shortly before the students’ lawsuit, 38 Harvard faculty members voiced their support of Comaroff inan open letter, challenging the University’s sanctions. Many of these faculty signatories were Black professors, some hailing from the African and African American Studies Department. Seeing names of Black professors in support of Comaroff brought me no other emotions but disgust and shame. But my conclusions regarding this situation were much more complex. Due to lack of representation, each of our individual actions are broadcasted to the rest of the greater Harvard community. Every action we do, every move we make, represents the Black community. Despite our minority status, I appreciate that we have created strong Black spaces and claimed Black professors as our mentors in order to preserve as much of our culture and seek comfort as much we can. Whenever I walk through the Harvard campus and see other Black faculty or students we always give each other a nod of solidarity or a smile, knowing the experience we share. However, I assumed that all of us on campus share most of the same morals and ideals — but obviously I was wrong. Sexual assault is a very serious problem on college campuses but I have always felt very safe in Black spaces. The Black professors who signed that open letter broke that safe space. I cannot imagine what it felt like for Black students to lose their mentor or their role model. To see Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Jamaica Kincaid on that list was painful to many, regardless if one was taught by them or not. The white students who saw their favorite white mentors or professors on this list have a multitude of others to choose from. For many of these students, their first thought probably wasn’t “they just set us back 10 years” or even considered that the professor was white. It was just some professor that did something wrong. These high expectations we have to meet to satisfy our own community — but also not to disappoint others — is unfair. I should not be afraid to make a mistake due to the impact it might have on the Black community. I should not have to worry about the secondhand embarrassment or shame from my peers’ mistakes. This monolith is dangerous and toxic and needs to be discarded. Yet, I also am not condoning the actions of the professors that supported Comaroff in the midst of his multiple sexual assault allegations. I am not giving Black people a free pass to commit horrific acts. Letting go of the idea that Black people are a monolith is not meant to shelter wrongdoers, but hopefully to help Black students realize the unfortunate reality that we cannot always rely on each other simply on the basis of race. Seventy-three professorscondemned their colleaguesand supported the women who were brave enough to speak out against Comaroff. Black professors were also represented on this list; it’s refreshing to see that exemplary leaders and role models still exist for Black students at Harvard. Most professors later revoked their support of Comaroff, including both Gates and Kincaid. This seems ingenuine and reactionary, however, and we should still condemn these professors for originally supporting Comaroff. Neither group represents the entirety of the Black community; we should not feel like Camroff’s supporters tainted our name nor should we feel like his critics were our saving grace. Black people deserve the autonomy to represent themselves. In efforts to protect my peers from the pain and shame like this again, we need to be cognizant of the drawbacks of the Black monolith.

Millions of people across the U.S. and the world have since continued to observe in horror as these events unfold. Pictures and videos of explosions and unrest, civilians being injured, groups fleeing into shelters and out of the country are inundating social media sites and news networks across the country and the world. Although the current situations are stressful, it is important that both the University of Arizona and college students actively remain aware of the ongoing crises and not become apolitical in this situation. While many current U.S. college and university students haven’t experienced or lived through a world war, many have been impacted by America’s vast conflicts with Iraq and Afghanistan. Because of this, the idea of and continuous discussions being held about the current war in Ukraine can be frightening to many college students because of the uncertainty that warfare could escalate to a point where the U.S. and other countries become increasingly involved.

Members of the UA community, as well as the UA, should be actively donating and supporting grassroots efforts and organizations that work to support Ukrainian and Russian civilians affected by the current war and also continue to demand sanctions against the Russian government.

stanforddaily_2022_93,"“Know the enemy and know yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles with no danger of defeat.” — Sun Tzu, ancient Chinese general and military strategist Regardless of whether you are an Economics or TAPS major, live in a co-op or EVGR, have never set foot out of the U.S. or come from across the ocean, the current Russian invasion of Ukraine has undoubtedly been one of the gravest matters occupying your mind and the inevitable destination of class discussions. The war reminds us that we should cherish the privilege of engaging in intellectual pursuits at Stanford and use our opportunity to arm ourselves with tools to better the world. This conflict has encouraged me and my peers to search for courses that offer an in-depth view into the war’s complex, multidimensional history and generally instilled in us a desire to gain diverse perspectives on world politics. However, scrolling through the course catalog, I found that the classes offered within the International Relations department — my desired major — that promise international perspectives are few, boiling down to the “Chinese Politics” and “Understanding Russia” electives. From my past experiences, courses with titles promising a focus on politics from international perspectives are inadequate in truly offering us an understanding of current politics from the points of view of global countries. The theories we delve into are almost exclusively Americentric: we study the eroding civilian control of the military by focusing on how it manifests in the Pentagon; we learn about nuclear weapons’ effect on international security to draw conclusions regarding whether Washington should initiate further arms reduction. Little of my course material educates me on how other countries, especially non-Western ones, approach the same issues; often, these courses fail to consider cultural differences. This is especially ironic for me, a Chinese native who finds herself writing policy memos to train herself to think like American decision-makers. With themissionto “promote the public welfare by exercising an influence on behalf of humanity and civilization,” Stanford should diversify its Political Science and International Relations curriculum to allow students to gain a more comprehensive worldview. While there has been a conscious effort across the country to incorporate the narratives of people of color into the literature curricula, exemplified by theDiversify Our Narrativeprogram founded by Stanford students, multiperspectivism has largely been ignored in politics classes. Bhu Kongtaveelert ’25, a native of Thailand, has been frustrated in his attempts at finding courses on Southeast Asia. “There is no political science class on Southeast Asia besides a course on human rights that examines the region with a savior complex,” Kongtaveelert said, adding that this is particularly frustrating given that “the high-tech market there has been burgeoning in recent years — I want to learn more about the global economic potential of my home.” He further criticized how the region is usually treated as a monolith of injustices and backwardness in the existing courses, which could only strengthen the students’ belief in stereotypes about Southeast Asia. Nowhere is the need for diverse narratives more acute than in the Political Science andIR programs, which focuses on “allowing students to explore how global, regional and domestic factors influence relations between actors on the world stage.” Whether we will become global leaders or simply educated citizens in the future, the perennial wisdom in Sun Tzu’s words reminds us that we can only make informed decisions when we are familiar with the perspectives of both our adversaries and our allies. This understanding involves not only the facts but also the ways of thinking, which are the underlying assumptions and worldview beneath each person’s actions. The current crisis in Ukraine reflects precisely that — to comprehend and preempt Putin’s decisions, Washington needs to first have in-depth awareness of his decision patterns and the historical traditions that inform his perspectives. To better help Ukrainians meet their needs for security and survival, we need to familiarize ourselves with the nuances in their priorities. This understanding cannot be gained through the one Ways – Engaging Diversity requirement that students must fulfill, or through the Chinese Politics and Understanding Russia politics electives that can easily be bypassed using other substitutes. The Stanford Political Science and International Relations programs should integrate the perspectives of other cultures into all of their courses, regardless of content or focus, in order to train students to become informed global citizens capable of empathy and educated decision-making. For students, this would increase representation of diverse narratives and allow them to better connect with those around them with different experiences. As an additional benefit, it would also give faculty members from more diverse backgrounds a chance to share their stories. When we have better access to information about those unlike ourselves, we can think outside the box and make unexpected connections and discoveries.

wildcat_arizona_2022_69,"University of Arizona’s Árbol de la Vida Residence Hall located on the edge of UA campus. Taken on August 16, 2020 during a student move in day. Freshman year of college is a crazy experience. It is a time when you are on your own, practicing your independence and meeting a countless number of new faces. There is already enough to be stressed about but imagine also having the COVID-19 pandemic linger over it all. This year’s University of Arizona freshman class was already robbed of half of its junior year and almost all of its senior year of high school. The thing many of us wished for the most was being able to have the normal freshman experience when we arrived at college. Because of the vaccines, we were lucky to be able to attend in-person classes and participate in numerous different social events. But the strict rules around masks and the aftermath of receiving a frightening positive COVID-19 test were still alive and well, especially in the dorms. I remember the concern I had before moving into my room in Likins Residence Hall. I wondered how severe the mask mandate would be and if the common rooms would be open. What if no one comes out of their room to socialize? Will I even make friends? All of these fears went out the window the second I stepped in the building and felt the warm sense of community from the desk assistants, resident assistants and other students in the dorm. Kate Pellegrini, a pre-nursing freshman, said that she was worried there would be very strict rules in the dorms. “I had heard they were really strict the year before us, so I honestly had no idea what to expect,” Pellegrini said. After moving in, Pellegrini agreed that it was not as bad as it could have been. “I feel like no one actually enforced the rules, but maybe that’s good because my experience felt normal … I don’t think I really missed out on anything,” she said. I think a lot of freshmen felt this way. At first, we were glad no one was forcing us to follow protocol, but for some students, things changed very quickly. Pellegrini ended up being sent to the UA COVID-19 isolation dorms right around Thanksgiving. “It felt so lonely. They gave us food, but it was terrible, and I couldn’t interact with anyone. The only person I saw the entire time was my random roommate, it was horrible,” Pellegrini said. For college freshmen, this was an experience unlike any other. Imagine being able to move into college like normal, attend normal classes, hang out with your friends every single day and then suddenly you are completely shut out from the outside world for 10 days in a dorm room that isn’t yours. The rules kept changing. I felt like I never fully understood what I was supposed to be doing because sometimes the protocol was enforced but sometimes it wasn’t. Ana Martinez, an RA at Likins, said she understood the confusion us freshmen felt by the ever-changing information we were receiving. “I feel like there are a lot of things people tell freshmen that is supposed to be advice, but in the context of the pandemic, it doesn’t really apply,” Martinez said. It was also challenging coming from the full lockdown we were experiencing senior year. With all the independence we have in college, it’s harder to remember that the pandemic is still going on and we need to continue to keep ourselves and others safe. Martinez said that the COVID-19 protocols in the dorms were hard to keep consistent at times. “It’s one of those things where after a certain point you can’t really enforce it. For example, the rule with how many people can be in your room at a time, people just sneak a huge group in and close the door, so there’s nothing you can really do about that,” Martinez said. Because this year’s freshman class had missed out on so much of its high school experience, many of us were going to do anything to make the most out of our first year in college. Looking back on how this year went, there was a lot of uncertainty and confusion, but it was still an amazing freshman year. The social connection everyone was able to make from being back on campus is something we should all be thankful for. The University of Arizona feels like home and not even the pandemic can change that.

state_press_2022_70,"Athletic Director Ray Anderson made his most critical decision at the most critical time for the program, and he made the wrong choice. Herm Edwards should have stayed. Athletic Director Ray Anderson made his most critical decision at the most critical time for the ASU football program, and he made the wrong choice. After ASU’s humiliating loss to Eastern Michigan on Sept. 17, President Michael Crow said decisions were needed to determine where the program was headed. He told TheArizona Republic, “Like anything, when you’re in combat, you support your officers. And we’re in combat. Crow’s actions matched his words, as Anderson is still in charge. Anderson, however, let his subordinate take the fall. Whether coach Herm Edwards was fired, or he and the University mutually agreed to part ways, Crow’s comments make one thing clear. If Anderson wanted Edwards to stay, then he’d be preparing for Utah. READ MORE:Herm Edwards out as football head coach Instead, some speculate Edwards, known for scoring an improbable touchdown in one of the biggest mistakes in NFL history — the “Miracle at the Meadowlands” — may have finished his career by beingfired in the end zone. Is this an equally embarrassing end, Severance at Sun Devil Stadium? Edwards headed to a commercial flight to San Jose, and ASU is headed toward a raging storm threatens the future of ASU football, this season and beyond. It’s clear the court of public opinion has ruled that Edwards had to go. The team has underperformed in his tenure, and ASU’s loss to Eastern Michigan is embarrassing. The NCAAinvestigationfor recruiting violations is serious. Edwards isn’t the sole cause of any of that — though he would never say it — and this unceremonious exit is short-sighted and shameful. His value, though arguably limited, remained the same this week as it did when he was hired — an experienced “big name” whose presence helped elevate national interest in the program. Edwards was the type of leader who could withstand criticism and weather turbulent times. Now, this mess leaves the program vulnerable. The fact that Anderson feels right now is the best timing for Shaun Aguano, the interim head coach, to carry that weight is baffling. Aguano wrote a letter addressed to theSun Devil Family, where he expressed love and asked for support through trials and tribulations because, he said, “it takes a village.” It would be a great story for Aguano to come in and overachieve. There may be a rush of enthusiasm from the team that might feel like change, and maybe that could improve the trajectory of the season. But like Edwards, he’s one coach fighting against systemic problems. Like Edwards, his character won’t be enough. And like Edwards, he’s probably more of an insulation against accountability for Anderson than he is a legitimate long-term solution. The end of the season would have been better timing. It would have been more respectful to Aguano and to Edwards. Whether Edwards would have salvaged the season or whether he would have lost to UA, Anderson would have had the entire offseason to decide what comes next. Instead, he gives the first-time college head coach less than a week to prepare for the beginning of conference play – and the most challenging three-game stretch of the season. How will that village — the same village thatbooedon Saturday and celebrated this midseason chaos – react when the team is 1-5? I’ll be curious to hear the thoughts of those celebrating his exit when the Wildcats storm the field on Black Friday. Given the chance, could he have improved this team enough by late November to win that game? That’s not even the worst of it. Power Five conferences are playing a game of musical chairs right now. ASU’s failures drag down an already weak Pac-12, which makes it more likely the conference will lose other top-tier teams than recruit them. That reality will be a consideration for any prospective coach. USC enticed Lincoln Riley away from Oklahoma and then the Big Ten lured USC away from the Pac-12. With leadership like this, look for ASU to overpay Rich Rodriguez from Jacksonville State and settle for the MAC – where they’ll replay the Severance at Sun Devil Stadium every year when they lose to Eastern Michigan University.

crimson_2022_105,"I think I should start by saying: If you saw me sobbing outside of Lamont Library the other day, no you didn’t. From there, I need to inform you all that the orange cat that wanders around campus has magical powers. The first time he approached me, as I sat unhappily on the steps of the church across from Pennypacker, I thought it was a strange but sweet and comforting coincidence. Between sniffles, I would scratch his small, warm head and watch him dart around looking for mice. A few weeks later, I was ranting to my dad over the phone about something incredibly inconsequential when I felt something bump against my shin. Who was there? It was none other than my tabby friend — a meeting that was once again odd, but soothing. A month after this, I found myself standing on the steps of Lamont Library at approximately 11:52 p.m. the night before my midterm paper was due. Feelings of inadequacy were consuming me; I felt like my control of the English language was gone and I just needed to talk to someone. I decided to call my sister. Not 10 minutes into my impromptu sibling therapy session, I heard a small purr. Walking straight toward me was none other than my good friend Remy. At this point, Remy the Harvard Cat is something of a nichemicrocelebrity, with nearly 12.3 thousand followers on Instagram and plenty of fans on campus. As it turns out, he’s more than an adventurous little feline who occasionally needs a break from his family — he’s also my on-call therapist. (Kidding. Mostly. I’m sure Remy’s appearances at the scenes of my minor breakdowns had less to do with me and more to do with the fact that they all took place within a roughly 0.1 mile radius of his stomping grounds. Still, there is little room to deny the relief that his simple presence brought me in each of those instances. But Remy’s magical powers have implications that extend far beyond my own situation. His ability to comfort students — even at the most obscure hours of the day — demonstrates the way that animals may function as a valuable mental health resource at Harvard. Students across campus experience higher rates of depression and anxiety than the national average. A 2020reportfrom the Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health described a widespread toxic culture at Harvard that prioritizes competition and busyness over wellness. And with the wait time for an initial appointment with the Counseling and Mental Health Services currently ataround six weeks, it is clear that the resources Harvard currently provides cannot adequately address the mental well-being of students at the College. This is where CAMHS might learn a lesson from Remy the Harvard Cat. Over the last few years, animal therapy has become increasingly popular in nursing homes, hospitals, and college campuses, supported by a growing body of experimental evidence. In theshort term, interactions with animals have been shown to relieve people’s stress by reducing cortisol levels. Over alonger period, continuous exposure to animal therapy has been shown to produce similar stress-relieving results that last up to six weeks after the program ends and to improve executive function in at-risk students. The value of pet therapy is also evident in its flexibility. Some students might view structured sessions with a counselor as another obligation, almost like a different class they have to attend. This can be counterproductive, as busy schedules and floor-length to-do lists are often the main causes of student anxiety and stress. For most people, playdates with pets don’t feel like an obligation. Simply put: Animals make people happy, and happy students are less likely to fail. Harvard Medical School’s Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine, which is located in Boston, hosts weekly “Countway Cuddles” sessions on Mondays and Thursdays where students are welcome to visit with therapy dogs. As lovely as this program is, its location makes it difficult for undergraduates to access on a regular basis. CAMHS also used to offer a biweekly animal therapy program called PAWS, but it was minimally advertised, and since the start of the 2021-2022 school year, it has only been offered as a one-time event rather than as a recurring program. While recent efforts to address student well-being have been heartening, they are not enough. The University is more than aware of the mental health crisis within the student body, and more accessible methods of mental health care need to be made available on campus. If Harvard chose to develop a more robust animal therapy program, it could ameliorate student mental health concerns while simultaneously alleviating some of the load on an already-overburdened CAMHS. None of this is to say that we should have golden retrievers and calico cats constantly roaming the Yard – it would totally steal Remy’s spotlight. But maybe it’s time Harvard invested in a few more therapists with tails for the sake of student mental health campus-wide. Sidnee N.

We watch the footage of the government’s crackdown in anger, frustration, and disbelief. Universities are places for intellectual exchange, open discussion, and rigorous debate; they are the last places security forces should be found — let alone found attacking students and professors. We at MIT have a decades-long connection with Sharif, as MIT played a role in its inception. Furthermore, MIT has a long history with Iran’s best and brightest at Sharif, many of whom have graduated from that esteemed institution and have come to MIT to further their education while simultaneously enriching our diverse student community. Many of our current graduate Iranian students and faculty hail from Sharif University; we also express our solidarity and heartfelt support for the entire MIT Iranian community who watch helplessly as the Iranian government’s brutality is unleashed upon their peers, friends, family, neighbors, and fellow citizens. We see you. You have our support and our empathy. We recognize that the government’s assault on Sharif is part of a wider crackdown on dissent in the country afterMahsa Amini’s death sparked nationwide protests. The 22-year-old died in the Iranian government’s custody after the morality police detained her for wearing her head covering “inappropriately.” MIT is a U.S.-based institution, and some may see this statement as violating another nation’s sovereignty, especially in the context of U.S. and Iran acrimonies and the extensive history of foreign intervention in Iran throughout much of the modern period. To be clear, this statement is not a call for any such intervention; we respect all nations’ sovereignty. As a global institution, however, what fate befalls people elsewhere impacts us here at MIT as well. We affirm the words of the venerated 13th-century Persian poet, Sa’adi: “Human beings are body parts of each other,In creation they are indeed of one essence.If a body part is afflicted with pain,Other body parts uneasy will remain.If you have no sympathy for human pain,The name of human you shall not retain.” We are also reminded of the timeless words of Dr. Mohammad Mossadeq, “If I sit silently, I have sinned,” reiterate our unequivocal condemnation of the Iranian government’s raid on Sharif University of Technology and the nationwide crackdown on peaceful dissent, and expressly support Iran’s student community as well as peaceful protest. We call on the Iranian government to withdraw all security forces from any and all campuses, release all detained students, faculty, and protesters immediately, and urge the government not to stand in the way of peaceful political expression.

rice_thresher_2022_8,"ByThresher Editorial Board10/25/22 9:45pm The last time Rice football made a bowl game, the world was singing “Let it Go,” Ebola cases were in the headlines and it had been a mere 52 years since a certain president spoke at Rice Stadium about going to the moon. Yes, 2014 was the last time Rice played postseason football. In the seven full seasons since, the Owls won a grand total of 20 games. But seven games and four wins into this season, they find themselves on the precipice of their first bowl game appearance under head coach Mike Bloomgren. Let’s make sure to show them the support they deserve this weekend. The team has exceeded expectations so far this year, beating conference powerhouse University of Alabama at Birmingham and ending what was, at the time, the longest active winning streak in Division I college football with a victory over the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. After Saturday’s overtime win against Louisiana Tech University, the Owls sit at fourth place in the conference. With just two more wins, the Owls can guarantee a postseason berth. Conveniently for us, the team has their homecoming game this weekend against the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, with a chance to close in on the postseason. Anyone who’s ever been to a Rice football game has seen opposing fans outnumber ours, usually by embarrassing margins. Let’s not make the team play its homecoming game in front of a sea of green in the stands, especially during a year in which they’ve earned our support. This weekend is also Rice’s annual Families Weekend. If you have guests visiting campus, bring them to the game. The team could use all the support it can get, and we should show out for our peers. With the team set to move to the American Athletic Conference next season, they’ll be playing higher-caliber opponents with bigger fan bases in more visible games. If we don’t want Rice to be embarrassed in the new conference, we have to start showing up to games. This weekend is our chance to do just that — supporting our team and helping them secure a vital win in their push for the postseason. Show up.

ubyssey_2022_18,"July 11, 2022 Written byJasmine Cadeliña Manango UBC’s department of geography and department of earth, ocean and atmospheric sciences have launched an interdisciplinary Certificate in Climate Studies and Action for the 2022/23 academic year. After receiving Board of Governors approval onJune 29, this certificate program is full steam ahead! The certificate is open to students in all faculties, and there are no prerequisites. According to the UBC Calendar, the program allows students to “take a deeper look at climate justice, the social, economic, political and cultural processes that underlie climate change.” There are 60 program spots available for the 2022/23 academic year cohort. Students can submit anapplication formto enrol in the program. Program co-coordinator Dr. Jessica Dempsey said the certificate was created in response to one of the strategic priorities determined by the UBC Climate Emergency Task Force — “expand climate education opportunities and resources for the UBC community and broader public.” Dempsey said this program provides an alternative path for climate engagement for students who are not involved in activist communities or traditionally represented in climate fields, like BIPOC. Suzanne Lawrence, the undergraduate advisor for the department of geography, said students are able to enrol in this certificate in addition to their degree. The program requires students to take 18 credits across 5 categories: climate action, climate emergency, climate justice, climate science and an elective. These courses include one capstone class and three one-credit climate action labs. Dr. Tara Ivanochko, program co-coordinator and academic director of the UBC Sustainability Initiative, said the climate action labs are “designed to be a common room” for the cohort, allowing students to engage with climate studies while creating connections with others in the program. Labs are divided into two main components: a group project and class-wide workshops. Group projects are developed to “meet the needs of community partners,” said Ivanochko. Students in the labs will be required to complete a project proposal by the end of the semester. Proposals selected by community partners — like the City of Vancouver, various non-governmental organizations and Indigenous communities — will be assigned to students in the capstone course the following semester. The program plans to develop an advisory board in the near future that governs over the certificate. Dempsey said this board will include the program directors, external stakeholders, students, alumni and faculty.

crimson_2022_4,"Many in our society suffer disproportionately from systemic racism in ways that dramatically alter their daily lives and future possibilities. Institutions have made initial good faith efforts to correct the longstanding effects of systemic racism. Yet most of these efforts rely on antiquated labels that don’t fully capture the diversity of the United States in the 21st century — and don’t help us to revise our fundamental understanding of race as we try to find better ways to achieve equity. Let me start with a story. In 1959, my parents were not allowed to obtain a marriage license in the first two states where they applied. They were different races: a blond white guy and a brown Hawaiian/Pacific Islander woman. After they figured out the marriage license (Colorado finally came through for them , they adopted a son and a daughter, and raised mixed-race kids with parents in a mixed marriage in an overwhelmingly white small Midwestern town. What could possibly go wrong? In elementary school, I was placed into the remedial classes for the “slow” kids. The teacher responsible for placing me into one of three tracks — remedial, regular, or accelerated — seemed to be unsure as to where I fit in. In middle school, students were selected to take IQ tests, but I was not offered to participate, as only the “smart” kids, not the “slow” ones, supposedly needed this test. In high school, I went to the guidance counselor to ask about taking the SATs. She said that I didn’t need to take this test because it wasn’t clear I would go to college, and, even if I did, the colleges that I would apply to wouldn’t require it. She sent me to meet with the Army recruiter instead. I was pulled over twice by the police in my overwhelmingly white neighborhood (once with a second police car arriving almost immediately . They let me go without even a warning because I had done nothing wrong, but why did they stop me at all? Did they profile me based on my appearance? I definitely didn’t look like anyone else in my neighborhood. Stories of being pulled over for no good reason arecommonamong Black and brown people. Still, while I was pulled over for questionable reasons, I didn’t think, “so this is how my life ends,” as many Black and brown people in the same situation have. As a Harvard professor, I have been told that it doesn’t look good for me to lead community disparities/equity projects because I’m “white.” Am I really? The nearly 34 million Americans who are mixed race — called “beige,” “half-breed,” “hapa,” or worse — often fit nowhere. Wemay choosea racial or cultural identity, but members of that identity don’t always acknowledge or accept us as their own. In 2010, approximately 15% of marriages in the U.S. were interracial. Why, then, does society still make us choose from a historical menu of ancestries? Race is a social construct, not a biological one. In the1790 US Census, you could be “free” or “slave” (read: white or Black . By thelate 1800s, you could be white, Chinese or Japanese (reflecting immigration patterns , Black, Mulatto (3/8 - 5/8 Black , Quadroon (1/4 Black , or Octoroon (1/8th Black . These designations for people of Black African ancestry were not designed to lift them up. Soon, the descriptors were replaced with the“one drop rule”: any amount of Black African ancestry made you Black. In 1860, an“Indian” categorywas added to the US Census, and in 1900, “Indians” who lived on reservations were included as well (American Indians literally didn’t count before then . When I have to check a box on race, do I report the biological ancestry given to me by the Thai father and Swedish mother I have never met, but are the sources of my physical appearance? Or do I answer according to my cultural heritage and social identity as I was raised (Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and Midwestern WASP , even though I don’t look like either of these groups and carry none of their DNA? I can check multiple boxes, but really I identify as a whole person, not disparate individual components. I think of myself as a baked cake, not just the eggs, flour, and sugar that were used to make it. Some forms provide the “other” checkbox option, one that reinforces our otherness as mixed-race people. “Rather not say” is there too sometimes, even if that answer implies that being mixed race is something to be ashamed of. “I’d rather not say” I ate a whole pint of ice cream in one sitting last night; my identity should not be equated to that level of shame. Since I was old enough to talk and still to this day, the top two questions I hear are: “What are you?” and “Where are you from?” Little microaggressions. Even after more than six decades of being asked, I still don’t have an answer. Sometimes I just turn the question back onto the asker and have them guess. Other mixed race people around the world have similar experiences. Tiger Woods designates himself as “Cablinasian” (that’s Caucasian, Black, American Indian, and Asian , perhaps because he identifies with all of his ancestries and doesn’t want to be defined by others based on his phenotypic features alone. In Russia’s 2002 census, it was possible to define your ethnicity in any way you wanted, so there were Russian Hobbits and Martians. But even if the U.S. Census allowed me to make something up, I’m not sure what label I’d choose. At the very least, I can say that I don’t want to check ill-fitting boxes, and I don’t want to coin a lonely designation for my ancestral-cultural heritage. Other people’s need to bucket your identity into easy-to-swallow but ultimately inaccurate categories, to the point of forcing you to check boxes in every doctor’s office and application form, takes a psychological toll. Beyond the dilemma that I and many others face every time a form with a checkbox for race is handed to us, no one seems to have a good idea of why they are asking for this racial information. Is it to understand diversity in the organization’s constituents? If so, is it biological diversity, cultural diversity, socioeconomic diversity, diversity in lived experience such as encounters with racism or discrimination, all of the above, or something else, that is being investigated? Is it to identify and correct gaps in the organization’s diversity goals? Or to inform resource allocation for those who belong to a marginalized group? No matter the answer to these questions, the “race/ethnicity” checkbox alone is unlikely to be the right way to gain the desired information. Consider socioeconomic diversity: Some academic applications now ask if you are the first generation to attend college. This is presumably an attempt to identify socioeconomic position in a way that one’s race/ethnicity does not necessarily reveal. It’s a start, although — like the race/ethnicity checkbox itself — this single question is likely inadequate to achieve the larger goal of socioeconomic diversity. And yet, we still default to a standard census-derived questionnaire on race to measure the vague concept of diversity. If you are a basic laboratory scientist, you don’t use the same assay for every experiment you do. The methods are determined by the research question, the specific hypotheses to be tested, and the analytical approach best suited to produce a meaningful finding. No good scientist will repeat the same experimental setup over and over, regardless of the question they are trying to answer. But this is our default practice when we measure diversity. We all fill out forms in the name of diversity, and usually we only see the “please check all that apply” end product. I have never encountered a clearly defined purpose for the collection of my race/ethnicity. Nor is it clear to me who will have access to and use this information, or how this information will achieve some pre-specified goal. I imagine this is because specifying purpose and usage is hard to do, and most don’t know where to start (or even recognize they should . Many organizations, includingThe Crimson, have made laudable efforts toward increased diversity and inclusion. But even these efforts don’t look beyond traditional labels — of white, Black, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or Hispanic — when it comes to race/ethnicity. If we are really serious about achieving diversity and inclusion, we are obligated to do the difficult yet fundamental work of clearly defining the purpose and goals for the labels we use, identifying appropriate metrics, and planning for the future use of collected information. Before we can develop and implement practices, processes, and policies to eliminate the inequities and disparities that marginalized people face, we must take a more considered approach to something as “simple” as the labels with which we are identified.

crimson_2022_113,"I am from the blisteringly cold Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan, where250 inchesof snow per season is the norm. My childhood was filled with snow, negative temperatures, and ice; I grew up in the cold. I figure skated avidly from the age of three. But my devotion to the chilly sport and fond relationship with winter weather came to a screeching halt after my diagnosis in November of 2020. Here’s my story: what it’s like to be literally allergic to the cold. During a routine figure skating rehearsal, I noticed red, itchy bumps forming on my legs and hands. I didn’t think too much of it until the next day, when I opened my window to get some fresh air, and the hives reappeared. Occurrences like this continued, but I wasn’t positive about the cause until two weeks later when I used an ice pack on my leg. Hives immediately formed in the exact shape of the ice pack on my skin. I saw a doctor the next day, who diagnosed my condition with an ice cube on my forearm. I have a rare form ofcold urticaria. My body reacts to cold exposure as though it were an allergen. For some people, this reaction can be minor, and lead only to itchy hives. My severity level is unfortunately much worse. While I do get skin welts and hives, I am also susceptible to anaphylaxis, shock, hypotension, and hypothermia. If I were to fall into the Charles River, it could be fatal. Not only does my body react to the cold, but it retains it. Even as my body reheats, or moves into a warm environment, the ice in my veins remains. I have to actively warm my skin, either through flaming showers or layers of blankets, to free myself from the cold. Anything less than my internal body temperature can cause a reaction. The weather outside may not always seem cold, but it can still give me hives. Lower temperatures are of course more dangerous, but even the warmer days can be a struggle. Sometimes, I venture out in full winter gear on a “warm” day, collecting stares and laughter from people as I pass. Now, I carry an EpiPen and inhaler with me everywhere I go. The medical alert tag around my neck displays in bold letters: COLD ANAPHYLAXIS. I show up to lectures in a bright yellow snowsuit and sit through discussion sections clutching hand warmers. I get strange stares and whispered comments frequently. I do my best to ignore them. It’s not always so easy, though. It’s one thing to live with the physical realities of my condition — the psychological toll is another deal entirely. Trying to explain why I can’t catch an Annenberg brunch with friends on a cold day. Zooming in to classes when it’s raining. The “I can’t go out with you tonight, it is too cold for my body to handle.” Sleeping through club meetings on the weekends because I had to take an emergency super-antihistamine that knocked me out for 16 hours. Cooping myself up in my dorm to wait out two days of a blizzard. The looks of disbelief when I tell people, “I am literally allergic to the cold.” I understand the doubt. Sometimes, I can’t believe it either. I don’t know if this condition will ever go away, but I don’t have much hope. Doctors still have no idea why this hit me so abruptly after years of living in the cold. There is no cure, and the treatments only add to the psychological toll of my abnormal life. All I can do is adapt and surround myself with people who understand. The next time you look out your window to a frosty Cambridge day, you may mull over grabbing a sweater or jacket, or dread the frigid walk to class. On these days, I wake up and wonder if today’s the day I freeze to death — literally. Gracia A. Perala ’25, a Crimson Editorial comper, lives in Straus Hall."
state_press_2022_66,"People walk within the gates of the Greek Leadership Village in Tempe on Tuesday, Feb. 15 2022. Greek Life remains an infamous yet elusive community that thousands of U.S. college students are part of, with sororities and fraternities being at the center of many conversations on campus. ASU is home to over70 Greek-lettered organizations, ranging from business fraternities to well-known sororities like Alpha Phi and Chi Omega. An exploration of this community reveals a few negative implications: Greek Life exhibits an exclusivity and inaccessibility that results in heightened classism and misogyny. Despite measures in place to fix these issues, they are insufficient. ASU Greek Life should incorporate increased financial assistance, diversity trainings and demographic reports into its organizations to combat these issues. Being in Greek Life is not cheap. New Panhellenic Association sorority members can pay up to $1,300 in dues, and member chapter dues are up to $890, according to ASU s 2022-23Greek Life Guide Book. While this cost is on the lower end of the national range (for instance,University of Alabamasorority members can pay more than double that , it is still a hefty charge for a school organization. Former Delta Zeta member Parker Goodman, asenior studying early childhood and early childhood special education, said the financial obstacles she faced while in Greek Life were a primary contributing factor to her withdrawal from the program this past year. If I was to miss work week, I would be fined anywhere from $600 to $1,000. They did not accept work as an excuse, which I think is unfair for girls who pay their own rent and own expenses, Goodman said. These excessive monetary dues can lead to exclusion of lower-income students, upholding values of classism. In 2013, research on 213,160 undergraduate students across nine large public universities from theAssociation of Fraternity/Sorority Advisorsshowed significant disparities in chapter house residencies among social classes. The study found 51.5% of those residing in Greek Life housing being upper-middle or professional class, while 33.6% were middle-class students. Low-income students accounted for an abysmal 1.7% of chapter house residencies. Sorority and fraternity dues — and in essence Greek Life itself — systemically exclude students of lower socioeconomic statuses, increasing homogeneity in class and other intersectional demographics, like race. Many universities, including ASU, do not complete demographic reports of members of Greek Life on their campuses. While secrecy is a prevalent facet of Greek society, it is no secret that this community cultivates an experience that is uninviting to those who are not wealthy and white. Along with the issues sororities and fraternities pose in regards to race and class, Greek society contributes to sexism and misogyny on campus. This is particularly apparent when looking at the differences between sororities and fraternities. Sarah Simpson, a Chi Omega member, Greek Life leader and senior studying public health, discussed both the positives and negatives that come with being in a sorority, addressing how sexism may play a role in ASU Greek Life. “Sororities are held to a higher standard of acting the right way and presenting yourself in a certain way, whereas fraternities can throw parties, openly drink and act in a different way, Simpson said. While we all have the same rules that we need to follow, they have more leniency, and if a sorority and fraternity were to break the same rule, (fraternities have less consequences. Sororities being held to higher standards than fraternities seems to be a common theme in Greek Life, as Goodman spoke on the matter as well, describing rush week for the two as polar opposites. For girls, it s extremely formal, takes about seven to 10 hours, and you are not allowed to speak on certain topics. For the boys, they host casual events for one to two hours and have no rules and regulations for what they can and cannot speak about, Goodman said. Women members of Greek Lifebeing met with stricter rule enforcement than men emphasizes the control of women within a patriarchal society. However, there is also the problem of inherently misogynistic values or guidelines sororities themselves are expected to abide by. Both Simpson and Goodman discussed how sorority members are held to certain standards in regards to their physical appearance, whether it be makeup and hair requirements while wearing their letters or social media requirements to represent what the sororities want them to. Simpson explained the week-long “bid process” in which women rank the sororities they like the most to the ones they like the least and, conversely, sororities rank the women they like the most to the ones they like the least. She said that if she could, she would change “how superficial it is.” Although superficiality is reason enough to encourage change in these processes, ranking girls in this way seems to contribute to misogyny, as these rankings are only based upon a week’s worth of limited interactions, prompting a strange sense of competition among women on campus. A program with a genuine sense of sisterhood would not place certain women at higher values than others. Goodman shares similar concerns to Simpson s as far as superficiality. Although she had a positive first-year experience, things seemed to shift as her sorority took on new member classes. It became obvious to me that a lot of these girls were not there to make new friends or to be supportive of new members joining, she said. While there are positive aspects of Greek Life that focus on building kinship and charity, oftentimes negative values are centered instead. ASU Greek Life should consider modifying certain aspects of the culture to make it more inclusive and safe for its students. Increased financial aid options, hosting more diversity trainings and holding the same expectations for sororities and fraternities can help mitigate the classism and misogyny embedded within the organization.

ubyssey_2022_8,"Sept. 14, 2022 Written byDouglas Baird To the members of the Ubyssey Publications Society (UPS , As the business manager of the UPS, I would like to thank all members for their support throughout this past year. The year has been one of transition as we moved from the restrictions of the pandemic to more normalized operations. Editors and staff have moved back into the office spaces and seamlessly transitioned to in-person workplace practices. As campus restrictions were lifted our reporters have returned to traditional methods and have incorporated those lessons learned while working remotely, striving to continuously adapt and improve our journalistic practices. This year’s editorial team, led by Charlotte Alden, is excited and eager to meet all challenges and professionally report on issues of interest to UBC students, faculty, alumni and the surrounding community. During the past year we hired another software developer, in addition to the two already established positions, to help transition and modernize our award-winning website. The work accomplished will foster a more user-friendly experience for our readership and help facilitate the web design/editor interface. Extensive work was also completed concerning the online advertising component of the web. This will allow our advertising manager to more effectively facilitate the placement of ads and improve services to our advertising clients. Moving forward into the new fiscal year — FY 2022/23 —The Ubysseywill continue to publish both in print and online. Print editions will be published twice monthly and our online publication will continue to be updated daily. Advertising revenues have recovered to about 75 per cent of normal with an expectation of full recovery by fiscal year 2023/24. The Ubyssey’s operating budget for FY 2021/22 ending August 31, 2022 was $484,000 in total income with expenditures coming in at $475,000. The operating surplus was due to more funding received from Canada Summer Jobs (CSJ than projected. This additional money has been allocated for equipment upgrades (computers and camera equipment . We will carry forward a CEBA (Canada Emergency Business Account loan of $40,000 until its due date in December 2023. Overall,The Ubysseyprojects thatUbysseyfees, advertising revenues and CSJ grants will keepThe Ubysseyon solid financial ground through FY 2022/23.The Ubysseyprojects revenues to come in at $485,000 (includes fees, government grants and advertising revenue and expenses of $491,000. The deficit of $6,000 is due to equipment purchases and will be covered by last year’s surplus. Currently, wages account for 75 per cent of the projected budget. Fifteen per cent of the budget will go to equipment purchases and office expenses, while the remaining ten per cent will go to conferences, travel and professional development. Adjustments to the budget will be made to compensate for shortages and monies will be allocated as appropriate while striving to balance the books. As a nonprofit entity, we are obliged to provide transparency to our membership on budgetary matters and will make available financial information to members who seek a more detailed breakdown of expenses.

thetech_mit_2022_33,"We are writing to share a “secret” about our lives as women faculty members at MIT. First, the not-so-secret part. As members of the informal “Happy Women at MIT” club, with a collective 50 years absorbing, contributing to, and reveling in the “Mens et Manus” mindset, the infusion of new students each fall reminds us that we have the best jobs in the world. Like so many of our colleagues at MIT, we grew up in working-class families, attended neighborhood high schools, and blissfully absorbed the power of math, science, and analytical thinking. We somehow ended up in top-tier graduate programs, a dream, and then as faculty at MIT, the quintessential home for nerdy (and outspoken problem solvers. For us, MIT has been a grand adventure. We continuously learn from brilliant colleagues and equally brilliant and creative students. We work in teams that are inspired to solve some of society’s toughest challenges, such as understanding how to alleviate poverty in Africa or building tools to aid pharma in identifying and developing new drug targets for complex diseases. Over the years, we have watched the MIT administration, in collaboration with scores of faculty advisors, rise in pragmatic fashion to address many challenges faced by women in our community, especially around work-life balance. For example: introducing on-siteday care, a term off from the tenure clock for junior faculty, and outstanding resources to help women navigate care of elderly or otherwise compromised family members. At the same time, we have been quietly dealing with an elephant in the room — bad periods! As a “secret illness of women,” bad periods are apervasive drain on the lives of roughly 20% of women. Yet, they’re rarely discussed in our professional environment. Several peer-reviewed studies have shown that, on top of having extra work taking care of children and elderly parents, women miss work more often than men because they themselves are sick more often than men are. An economist might ask: Does this difference contribute significantly to the “wage gap?” Each of this article’s co-authors has juggled conferences, grant deadlines, teaching class, and other professional responsibilities while either in excruciating pain or taking brief time off for major surgery to address a gynecological disorder we have in common. We both suffer from endometriosis (more details on Linda’s experiences are publishedelsewhere. . Endometriosis is a gynecological disorder where the lining of the uterus, the endometrium, is found growing outside the uterus — in the abdominal cavity. It often invades the bowel, the intestines, the bladder, and even burrows through the diaphragm to the lungs. Endometriosis afflicts about1 in 10women around the world, often with onset of symptoms right at the first menstrual period and lasting well past menopause. The symptoms include debilitating pain, infertility, and excessive menstrual bleeding that can lead to anemia and a host of other problems. While some patients respond to hormonal therapies that suppress estrogen — including an increasingly popular family of drugs that cause menopause —a vast proportion do not respond to these therapies or suffer intolerable side effects. Surgery to remove lesions remains the gold standard treatment for endometriosis. Many patients have repeated surgeries for symptom recurrence. A sister disease, adenomyosis, involves invasion of the endometrial lining into the muscle of the uterus andlikely afflicts about 10% of women— but we don’t really know, since it cannot be seen during surgery for endometriosis. Most physicians do not know how to screen for adenomyosis, and there is barely any research on it. And this is just one disease contributing to the sobering statistic that one in three women in the U.S. over age 60 has had a hysterectomy. If PubMed citations are used as a proxy for research intensity, integrating all activity in academia and the private sector, the magnitude of the problem is revealed when comparing research on Crohn’s disease (afflicts about one percent of the U.S. population, approximately equally between the sexes to research on adenomyosis (estimated to afflict two to three percent of the overall US population : 63,000 publications on Crohn’s and 3,400 on adenomyosis, as of September 2022. Not surprisingly, according to the NIH Reporter database, the NIH has only funded two grants on adenomyosis in recent decades. This wide deficit in research intensity for adenomyosis reflects theshockingly poor fundingfor research on this and other gynecological disorders and, more generally, the constellation of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, ranging from chronic Lyme disease to multiple sclerosis —diseases that skew strongly female. As revealed inbackground researchfor the Congressionally-mandated conference on “Advancing NIH Research on the Health of Women” held in 2021, only about 50% of NIH research grants targeted to women’s health go through the flexible and structurally well-supported investigator-initiated route, compared to 80% of grants overall. Others go through “Funding Opportunity Announcements” (FOAs . Whereas the investigator-initiated route has three regular submission deadlines a year, opportunity to resubmit revised grants, and benefits from standing review panels with published compositions, FOAs have only one submission date (typically soon after the FOA is announced , no opportunity to resubmit, and highly-specified requirements for the work to be conducted. The poor support for research translates into a weak clinician-scientist research community, further exacerbating treatment gaps. Historically, innovation around the diseases specifically afflicting women has lagged behind that of other diseases. An open question is whether the recent flurry of interest and activity in “Femtech” — much of it driven by women entrepreneurs — can succeed when the research infrastructure remains weak after so many decades of underinvestment. Together, we realized:MIT can do something about this.In fact, we believe MIT is uniquely positioned to. We can marshal talent across all the disciplines, from the basic sciences to economics, needed to bring scientific awareness, societal respect, and increased funding for common gynecological (and other disorders that affect the lives of tens of millions of women around the world. We can do this in much the same way these talents were joined and brought to bear on breast cancer decades ago. We already have infrastructure. TheMIT Center for Gynepathology Research (CGR was launched in 2009 by Linda, in collaboration with Dr. Keith Isaacson at Newton-Wellesley Hospital, as a nexus for clinicians, scientists, engineers, and patients to engineer new directions in gynecology research. CGR research has been internationally recognized, so much so that MIT was chosen for theBoston-area screeningof a new endometriosis documentary executive-produced by Hillary Clinton. The film screening will be on Wednesday, Sept. 14. (Get tickets athttps: web.cvent.com/event/0026e938-538e-4ab3-a443-27d414ab2e93/summary. In conjunction, we are organizing a“Stand Up and Be Counted” eventon Killian Court that afternoon starting at 4:45 p.m., inviting all MIT community members who care about debilitating gynecology disorders — and women’s health in general — to “Stand up and Be Counted.” Perhaps it is time for MIT to consider a “Women’s Health Initiative” as a bold step ahead of other engineering schools in bringing practical Mens et Manus know-how to under-the-radar problems draining the energy from so many talented women. We have a community of creative and brilliant students. MIT alums have gone on to be some of the most important and impactful entrepreneurs in the world. At last count, MIT’s alumni entrepreneurs have created companies whose revenues are altogether nearly $2 trillion, which is larger than the gross domestic product of the world’s 10th largest country. To us, there is no problem that MIT students, alumni and faculty cannot solve if they put their heads together. This should be one! Join us in Killian Court on Sept. 14 to raise your voice in support!

rice_thresher_2022_12,"ByJasmine Hunter10/4/22 11:22pm Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. Two Wednesdays ago, instead of ending my weekly Thresher reading with a laugh, I was shocked to see a piece that included the Bible and prayer in order to mock a Christian professor on campus. Turning to other Christian students and Rice parents, I found similar shared disappointment and sadness. Myself and others sent emails to the Thresher explaining why we found this piece distasteful and discriminatory. We were answered only with aneditorialpublished Sept. 27 saying, in essence: it’s satire, so take a joke. According to Merriam-Webster, satire is “a literary work holding up human vices and follies to ridicule or scorn.” Satire is meant to criticize in a comedic way, while a joke is only meant to elicit laughter. This year we’ve seen the Backpage poke fun at Fizz, Publics culture, the JFK 60th Anniversary, nice-guy dating advice and the alleged accomplishments of HackRice. Would we say that the Thresher is criticizing HackRice? Would the Backpage content creators march into President DesRoches’ office and demand that all Publics were canceled? I can’t say definitively that they wouldn’t, but in my opinion, the Backpage pieces often aren’t true satire, but light comedic relief. Let’s take them at their word and say that the piece on Dr. Tour was satire, meant to criticize him in a comedic way. What are they criticizing? If the piece on him was about the folly of abiogenesis, what his talk was actually about, I would understand. Some abiogenesis fans out there would probably be offended, but it’s satire, so they should take a joke. The Backpage however, chose to make a piece on his personal religious beliefs. Their satire wasn’t about science, but Christianity. They mocked prayer, the Bible itself and the scripture within it. If not ridicule and scorn, then it was just a joke meant to make someone huff in amusement and break the tension of the week’s reporting. The question I would ask then is this: amusement at whose expense? We’re told that the Thresher ensures “the Backpage does not stereotype or capitalize on marginalized communities.” Are the Christians on campus not a marginalized community? As I heard in CDOD, we’re at a majority-atheist/agnostic, secular school where Christianity, or religion in general, is not the mainstream. And when Christians on campus do speak up, we’re told to sit back down and take it. My mother used to say to me when I was little that “a joke isn’t a joke if someone isn’t laughing,” and she wasn’t giving me stand-up comedy advice. How can we tell where the jokes end? That is decided by those who were made to be the punchline, regardless of the jokester’s intentions, beliefs or biases. We have a culture of care that extends to anyone regardless of their race, sex, sexual orientation, identity, background and yes … religion. When people come to us when they’ve been hurt, we don’t push them aside. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_16,"Bikini shot. Birthday shout-out. Snappy posts complete with a slider tool to indicate on a scale (with emojis for units! how you’re feeling today. A slide deck listing the symptoms of growing up with emotionally unavailable parents. Bikini shot. Another birthday post — wait, there’s two birthdays today? Next, a post titled “It’s Time We Talk About Casual Ableism”— a comprehensive lesson complete with pastel colors and speech balloons. To an Instagram user who joined the platform for updates on “The Bachelor” or pictures of their newborn nephews, these posts may seem out of place, misinformed, or just blatantly tasteless. I have an iPhone 6, so consider me prehistoric, and I don’t frequent Instagram enough to be fully cognizant of evolving trends and post formats. Regardless, at some point in the transition from heavily-filtered collages of cat pictures to longer-form, interactive posts, a creative form of activism emerged — posting dramatic news headlines with aesthetic images and cutesy fonts. Performative activism — activism done to improve one’s social capital rather than advance a cause— is certainly flawed. To the viewer who picks up the daily newspaper, these sporadic calls-to-action may seem to severely lack substance. The undoubtedly superior, prestigious viewer may scoff at a shimmering “Sex Workers Need Rights” post covered in digital stickers. But would you rather they not address it and learn nothing at all? At the bare minimum, one must familiarize themselves with current affairs to design one of these posts. Thus, regardless of whether or not the careless creator failed to critically analyze all evidence before submitting their social media infographic for peer review, they had to, at least to some degree, consider the message they were sending. As a Facebook user, I constantly read ill-informed “opinion pieces” reposted by my friends and family members. I would much prefer the younger generation of Instagram users explore their ideas factually in infographics and contribute to conversations that will hopefully extend beyond their following. If a friend replies to an infographic with a “So true” or a “Yass!” — that is social progress! Threading controversial and pertinent ideas through the channels of friendscan shapehow casual discussions materialize and expand. Indeed, it is uncomfortable to see Covid-19 mortality rates or global poverty statistics displayed in the foreground of a laughable doodle. The childlike, whimsical representation of devastating news is certainly unsettling. But who is going to post a starving infant on their Instagram story? Especially in sequence after the sorority shot from their Florida Keys self-discovery team retreat? No, I do not champion these artsy infographics as the height of modern education; nor do I believe their presentation is necessarily sensitive, just, or effective. But if you’re frustrated that casually reading academic journals has not yet become a trend, become an influencer. And if you think influencers are brainless Instagram addicts who lack the ability to meaningfully impact their audience, consider the millions who repost their bikini pictures and their politically-driven statements alike. As much as we love to reminisce on the print newspapers of the past, the fact of the matter is a significant percentage of Americans are reading the news on social media. It is time to accept that information being spread through social media is the potential next phase of formal news consumption. If Instagram can compel 55 million people to like a picture of anegg, why can we not take advantage of its effects and create an avenue for political discussion as well? I’ll admit it — it’s disquieting when I open Instagram only to be hit with my younger sister’s friends posting about genocide, especially since I have only ever used Instagram for aimless pleasure. But the purpose and presence of social media is evolving. We cannot deny that many people have fallen victim to a habit of scrolling through slews of followers’ photos and videos on the daily. Maybe infographics are just the start of a movement to make social media platforms more meaningful. As a Harvard student with an active Apple News app, I’ll confess that I learned something in an infographic I hadn’t read in headlines about the Russia-Ukraine crisis just a few days ago. And I fact-checked it, just for the skeptics who persistently think that infographic curators are not equipped to learn, teach, and share about something weighty – albeit in sparkly fashion. Haley M.

wildcat_arizona_2022_28,"This year, fear has become the defining marker that unites us as students at the University of Arizona. Violence on our campus is no longer something that is senseless, but expected — we are horrified but not surprised by the outpouring of shootings, harassment, threats and racial targeting. This type of experience was not one we imagined having when sending an application to this university, nor was it what was expected by faculty when they came to teach in a place revered for its sense of community — community, it seems, that is only important to the UA on paper. So to the people in power — the dean, the provost, the president — and all the others at this university who have the ability to make change both big and small, we urge you to listen. Stand up to violence and protect the students and faculty who have put their faith in the UA. After all, there is only so much you can ignore. —Sophie Applin,Opinions Editor Perhaps it is unwise for us to keep kicking up old flames when many believe them to have already settled into ashes. Perhaps it may be considered dramatic or childish to rehash such “old news,” to demand to be taken seriously in our desperate pleas for safety and respect. But, when the University of Arizona continues to choose inaction over response, when they continue to brush tangible concerns of safety to the side, fear only grows, and fear is not what was promised to us in all those glossy brochures. What was promised was belonging and security. What was implied was that the people in charge would look after interests other than their own. While this university may be fractured, a campus community is not dictated by the ones who sit behind their desks approving or denying campus-wide condolence emails. It is decided by the people who move through our streets, who protest for a better life, who don’t want to live in fear, so we will not stop demanding more from the UA. Students and faculty deserve better: we deserve action. The old flames that are not kicked up turn into giant fires that are difficult to extinguish and impossible to disregard. As students, we see this pattern often at the UA as it trickles down to our campus life. Alongside our fear grows an increasing stream of anger. Anger for what we thought was owed to us during our college experience — a sense of safety and a sense of community. At the very least, a sense of being heard. Unfortunately, it seems as if those expectations are unrealistic. Continuous lack of action and growing feelings of fear are elements we as students have become rather acclimated to. This is not a climate we want to live in. Neither should you. I was always taught that leaders guide with action and not words. As students and as young people, we look to these leaders for assistance as we navigate the various ups and downs of our growing adulthood. Naturally, I stuck to this belief when earlier this year, my phone number and personal information were purposefully leaked to over 100,000 people by a student at the UA. As my phone was bombarded with countless threats of both death and rape, I felt comforted by my trust of those in positions of power. I speak for both myself and the numerous other victims of harassment at the UA when I can now only describe that trust in the university as foolish. RELATED:We trusted the process, and the process failed us The UA Dean of Students Office was made aware of my situation immediately, and I once again was consoled by the promise of action. Both I and theDaily Wildcatshared every ounce of proof I had of the innumerable and indisputable threats to my safety and well-being with the university. With this, I was told that it would all be reviewed. I was told how sorry the UA was that this was happening to me. I was told that the UA takes these matters seriously. I was told that my safety is important. I believed in the action promised because I believed in the integrity of leadership. Like so many others who voiced their concerns to the UA, I was left with nothing but disappointment and false bravado. It is almost unfathomable to understand why both mine and so many others’ pleas to be taken seriously were not deemed as worthy enough of a proper reaction from the university. As a young female, I found myself wondering why the obscene and misogynistic threats to my safety were not enough for the UA to take action. I wondered why it felt like I had to beg them to take me seriously, to listen. While I wish they were, the “apologies” were not sufficient for the violence I endured. They were certainly not sufficient for Thomas Meixner, nor were they sufficient for Kai Leigh Harriott. The only appropriate response to violence within a community is action. It is a shame that seems to have gone over the heads of those it should matter to most. My experience at the UA has stolen my faith in proper academic leadership and with it took my sense of security, safety and belonging. However unfortunate, I feel comfort in knowing that I am not alone in this feeling. I still believe in the integrity engraved within leadership, just not through this university. Despite the horrific events of this past semester, whether pertaining to myself or not, I take solace in what I have learned. The old flames that we kick up are the same ones that cultivate and simmer inside of us. As we ignite these old flames, we can burn a path guiding us to change. —Olivia Krupp, opinions writer Follow theDaily WildcatonTwitter"
state_press_2022_31,"ASU men’s basketball coach Bobby Hurley expresses his frustrations towards the referees during his team s game against the Portland Pilots at Desert Financial Arena on Tuesday, Nov. 9, 2021. ASU won 76-60. This season has definitely not lived up to the hype for ASU men s basketball. Currently, the Sun Devils are 6-12 and sit in ninth place in the Pac 12. Many people look to Bobby Hurley as the sole problem of this team when in reality, that s not really the case. Should Hurley take some blame for this lackluster season? Absolutely. Should he be looked at as the only problem? Absolutely not. COVID-19 has impacted everybody, but it had a very specific effect on the Sun Devil basketball team. The Sun Devils looked like they were finding a rhythm in early December 2021 when they beatOregonin overtime, then the GCU team,and finally Creighton. But the Sun Devils soon after lost to San Francisco s team by only one point. From then on, I don t necessarily put the blame on Hurley. The team s next three games were canceled due to circumstances outside of any team s control. Specifically, ASU s two meetings with USC and UCLA were postponed due to COVID-19 outbreaks. After their trip to face Cal, where they ultimately lost by 24 points, ASU traveled back to Tempe, wheremayhembroke loose. According to Coach Hurley in a press conference on Jan. 14, the whole program basically was shut down from Monday till Friday in a quarantine situation. We tested the whole program on Thursday and that s where we had a number of positive cases. The Sun Devils went an entire month only playing one game. This is where I place the blame, not on Hurley. According to Frank LoVecchio, a current COVID-19 researcher and former emergency medicine physician, the virus spreadingamong a team seems inevitable because of the nature of virus — in that it can spread by just breathing someone else s air. If (we are close together, (we re playing basketball, we re covering each other, we re gonna be breathing harder and exchanging air or catching something that was in your air, LoVecchio said. So it s almost inevitable that for people in small quarters, people on a team, that it s gonna spread through the team pretty quickly. I mean what else could you have done? Hurley and his players were decimated by COVID-19. In his press conference before the Jan. 15 Colorado game, he said he was, able to gradually feel better and each day I m feeling better and have more energy, but it definitely, definitely hit me pretty good. Hurley is in a constant state of limbo as to who is on his roster whenever he is making his starting lineup. Hurley had a chance to get the Sun Devils to the NCAA tournament in 2020 before the tournament was put on hold, and after that, life as we know it has changed for all of us. Give Bobby Hurley until the end of the season, and if he can battle through the injuries and illness, he should be back next season.

crimson_2022_144,"I remember lying on the linoleum floor of my dorm room, pen in hand, thinking of what to write in my Class of 2024 Journal, gifted to us by the administration to help document our first few months on campus, the Fall of 2020. There was of course the excitement of living alone for the first time, in a new city, with new people. The awkwardness of having to microwave my cold meals in my roommate’s microwave. The courtyard conversations about Black Lives Matter and the Ruth Bader Ginsburg memorial at Harvard Law School. Mourning the death of reason, of kindness, of empathy. The slow, naive realization that power meant what those with power could get away with. And despite my deep sigh of tepid relief on November 7th, 2020, an unbearable self-awareness of my absence of efficacy lingered. I’ve been feeling this way again recently. From talk show segments to New York Times columns, the alarm — no, fear — surrounding the rising number of people, particularly young people, who identify as BGLTQ has somehow spread everywhere. I can’t help thinking: “this is not going to end well,” because history is rather unkind to groups of “scared” people who frequently talk about the extinction of a majority group (in this case straight people they belongto. There is a troubling history of this country of civil rights battles being won and then quickly undermined and rolled back. The most notable example of this phenomenon is of course what followed reconstruction. In the aftermath of the Civil War, three reconstruction amendments were passed and the American army maintained a presence in the South to enforce the newfound rights that formerly enslaved people had won. This period was far from enshrining complete equality but it did see the election of this country’s first Black senators and governors, positions that wouldn’t be filled by Black people for nearly a century after. Despite the progress that came about from this period, or perhaps because of the progress, the anti-slavery Republican party, agreed to withdraw the remaining federal troops out of the South in the Compromise of 1877 in exchange for the victory of Republican Rutherford B. Hayes in the 1876 Presidential election and 100 years of racialized terror in the form of Jim Crow ensued. The 1960s and 70s employment discrimination based on gender was outlawed, the birth control pill was released, abortion and contraception were legalized, Title IX was passed and women entered universities en masse. These two decades of progress were followed by the Reagan Revolution and the rise of the so-called “moral majority” that celebrated traditional gender roles and decried the advancement of civil rights. My fear is that the same thing is happening in the civil rights movement for the BGLTQ rights movement. In the 2000s and the 2010s, intercourse between people of the same sex was legalized; Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was repealed; and marriage equality became the law of the land. This belief that being queer is somehow a social contagion that must be stopped is not new but feels more dangerous than before because we, not just queer people, as a society are at risk of losing the social freedom that has enabled non-straight and non-cisgender to exist openly and honestly. This newly materialized wave of homophobia and transphobia is currently being felt by public school students and their teachers. Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” law is only one of the most notable examples of a law intended to make schools less safe and inclusive for BGLTQ students. Ahorrifying billpassed by the Ohio House of Representatives would allow for “genital inspections” of student-athletes suspected of being transgender. The 20s can be the 60s or it can be the 80s. It can be a time when we push to make this country one where queer people are not simply tolerated but valued as a celebrated part of society. This transition to a more humane community will require us to think about gender not as something that restricts behavior but as a lens to experience the world. Despite this onslaught of institutional bigotry, more people than ever before are identifying as gay, bisexual, and transgender and Harvard is no outlier. According to The Crimson’s annual survey of each year’s entering class, Harvard seems to mirror, and perhaps embody this national coming out as a record28.9 percent of Harvard’s class of 2025identify with a sexuality other than heterosexual. Yet, The Crimson’s survey also pours cold water on the notion that the rise in queer identification is the product of young people trying to be trendy or cool. While these students decided to share their sexual orientation anonymously with The Crimson, the majority, 60.5 percent of them, have not yet “come out.” We clearly have more to do to make Harvard a place where everyone has the freedom to find themselves in meaningful ways without fear of discrimination. The longer I’ve been here, the more I’ve realized that Harvard is a microcosm of the enormous potential but also the incredible failings of our world. From when I first arrived at a Harvard of quarantining in place and forbidden social interactions to now, my perception of college has not been one of the freedom and flexibility I imagined but of deep communal and self-regulation. The feeling that even sliding an inch on the scale of social acceptability is an unacceptable risk for so many who have come so far is palpable. On the surface, it might appear as though Harvard has gone as far as it can go in terms of combating discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation. Massachusetts has some of the world’s strictest human rights laws protecting queer people, and Harvard enforces all of them. In terms of institutional policy, I believe Harvard actually represents the top tier of colleges in terms of its treatment of queer students. The problem lies more with the students themselves. My hope is that this concentration of homophobia and transphobia will inspire a resistance that gains even more salience. Universities have a chance to be the outlier in a culture deciding to become more bigoted and restricted. From scientific to social progress, institutions of higher learning have long represented change in America. They are where some of the world’s most outgoing, engaged, thoughtful people all get together in one place and talk about ideas. Education is a liberalizing experience because it allows us to think in new ways and imagine the world differently. Yet, unfortunately, many universities — Harvard among them — have a long way to go in their effort to extend this feeling of freedom and liberty to all their students. Harvard is still a heavily gendered and racialized campus. Sexuality and gender are not the same thing, but they are entirely interrelated — and the systems that oppress women on this campus also oppress and suppress queer men and non-binary people. One’s gender determines which organizations they can and cannot be a member of, and the specter of race looms large on all aspects of social life here. Furthermore, in the same survey, that percentage of BGLTQ students, also found that more than three-quarters of female and non-binary entering students worried about sexual assault on Harvard’s campus. When we speak of bigotry and oppression we are fundamentally talking about power, who has it, and who does not. Harvard is an institution with unrivaled proximity, and perhaps, celebration of power. Harvard students might make their school a more open and liberalizing experience by critically analyzing how enforced gendered expectations create and systemically deny people power and agency. It is because of this remarkable concentration of access and opportunity that gives what happens at Harvard outsized weight in the rest of the world. The way students learn to treat their peers at Harvard will have ramifications we can only imagine. But fortunately, we have the power to do something about it. Gordon J.

thetech_mit_2022_64,"International students are a vital part of the MIT graduate student community. We are also among the thousands of members and hundreds of organizers of the MIT Graduate Student Union (GSU . The reason we are involved is quite simple — like all of our colleagues, international or not, our voices should matter. As international students, we face many roadblocks to advancing our graduate program that we seek to address through unionization. We are voting yes on the GSU because we deserve: adequate resources and support; protections when we are confronted with visa issues or travel restrictions; and equal opportunity and fair policies — for example, around Curricular Practical Training (CPT to advance our research, professional development during our program, and Optional Practical Training for post-graduate jobs and a stable future. MIT has imposed significant burdens on international students in obtaining CPT approval. CPT is a federal policy that allows international students on F-1 visas to participate in professional development activities, including internships. Many departments have additional restrictions on CPT approval beyond federal requirements, while some departments approve no CPT at all. Formal policy or not, this is the reality we face. Compared to our domestic coworkers, international students are denied equal opportunities for career advancement and are disadvantaged in our future job markets. We deserve equality and fairness regardless of our nationality. With a union, we will fight for a more inclusive MIT that enables everyone to thrive. Our campaign is one based in unity, hope, empowerment, and urgency. It is based on an undeniable belief that we are stronger when we are acting together rather than alone. We are voting yes because we want MIT to realize its full potential as a cutting-edge research institution where all graduate students can thrive. In one of MIT’s recent, bizarre emails about our campaign, the administration struck a different tone — one of negativity, futility, and fear. Among the statements they made, they implied that international students with spouses and families face additional financial burdens in their graduate programs at MIT. We agree. However, MIT oddly used this as part of their argument against unionization in a recent email. They imply that international students on fellowship will be restricted by unionization and as a result would not be able to take on second jobs to support themselves. While the statement itself is highly misleading, it also raises a deeper question: why do international fellows need to take on second jobs? Surely, MIT can take concrete steps to address these issues we face as international students. Unfortunately, many of their recent policies have done the opposite. It was just three years ago when MIT displaced hundreds of international students and their families from the Eastgate Apartments into Site 4, with skyrocketing rents. Many of our international colleagues with families now spend upwards of 70% of their stipend on rent. It was just two years ago, in the middle of a global pandemic, when MIT announced that international students abroad must return to the U.S. by January 2020 or they would risk losing their appointment. Many of us were directly affected by this policy as our entire futures suddenly went into flux. This is not the way it has to be. We have joined the GSU and will be voting yes on unionization in the upcoming election because we want to make MIT the world-class research institution we know it can be. But in order to do that, we have to make meaningful changes to remove the obstacles that prevent us from being the best researchers we can be. As international students, we are fighting for equal opportunity and adequate support. We can start to make these changes if we come together with our coworkers and win our union. Not every graduate student at MIT is international. But whether it comes in the form of dental coverage, affordable housing, financial security, or meaningful Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies, all graduate students know that positive change can and must be made to improve MIT and improve the quality of our lives. As international students, regardless of our national origin or visa status, we have thesame rights as U.S. citizens to participate in union activities, including voting yes for our union in the upcoming election. Retaliation against protected union activity, including threats toward our visa status, is illegal. It is also illegal for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to even ask someone about their union participation. In the 50 years that graduate student unions have existed in the U.S., there have been no documented cases of international students facing visa issues due to union support. We are international students and we are voting yes on the GSU because our voices should matter. Join us bysigning the vote yes petitiontoday!

crimson_2022_41,"Editor’s note:The following pictures of Harvard undergraduate students were all taken in the weeks leading up to the Supreme Court oral arguments in the Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College trial, which is broadly seen as likely to weaken or dismantle race-conscious admissions policies if not affirmative action altogether. The images, along with the musings of the students pictured, are meant to freeze in time a fraction of our campus as it was before the tide began to shift. Photographs by Dumebi M. Adigwe ’23 Editorial Chair Guillermo S. Hava helped curate the picture selection and edited the quotes for length and clarity. “While affirmative action policies played a part in the admission of students of color being here, the truth is our academic talents and extracurricular pursuits solidified our rightful place in this class – and those talents speak for themselves. Many of us struggled to get here. There is nothing preferential about our experiences to get to Harvard. And we’re still struggling to keep our place. We all deserve a level playing field of opportunity.” “Affirmative action is fair admissions, and the justices should see that and the research, facts, and testimonies that back that. Affirmative action admits are proud that these policies aknowledge and pay respect to our struggles in an unjust system, and race-blind socioeconomic alternatives will never be adequate enough to properly explain our worth and potential” “Race should never be seen as a credential for why someone should be at an institution like Harvard. Everyone who comes to Harvard should deserve to be here, but I don’t think Affirmative Action implies that people are coming here that aren’t getting in on the basis of their talent. Being at Harvard would not be the same were it not for the diverse and unique perspectives brought forth by underrepresented groups. It seems to me that SCOTUS believes educational diversity can be achieved without directly taking account of race, but that’s just untrue.” “White supremacy continues to wield the model minority myth as a tool to divide people of color. In portraying affirmative action as a zero-sum game between Asian Americans and other minorities, Students for Fair Admissions is, once again, using Asian Americans to invalidate the struggles of other people of color. As Asian Americans, we must speak out against these narratives and call on our communities to do the same. Although 69 percent of Asian Americans support affirmative action, I want to address the concerns of those who disagree. Here’s what SFFA won’t tell you: The effect of Asian American ethnicity on an applicant’s likelihood of admission is statistically indistinguishable from zero. There is actually a positive correlation between being an Asian American woman and an applicant’s likelihood of admission. And if the Court outlaws affirmative action, the group that gains the most representation would not be Asian Americans. The number of white students at Harvard would increase by three times the number that Asian American students would. The notion that affirmative action discriminates against Asian applicants is a malicious myth, and its abolition would only hurt disadvantaged Asian Americans.” “No racial or ethnic groups have a monopoly on talent or intelligence, but some students have a monopoly on affirmative action, and race-conscious policy accounts for that discrepancy. This isn’t just Harvard, it is universities around the country, this can have an incalculable impact, so we have to fight against white supremacy, we have to fight for solidarity. I as an Asian American refuse to be used as a ploy for white supremacy.” KB: “I am worried for the generations after us. I have heard enough apologies from folks before us, and I dread the day that we will be apologizing to the next generation about the conditions they are forced to grapple with. As Harvard students, we are bound together by more commonalities than differences. If we can unite to show the world that we unequivocally support each other and the values of diversity and opportunity, we will win regardless of the outcome of this challenge. We cannot fall into a racial conflict fueled by myths. Harvard students must reflect on what our campus community means to themselves. The path forward lies in this reckoning and the incessant conversations which result from it.” KY: For decades, the Supreme Court has consistently affirmed race-conscious admissions in higher education. After arriving at Harvard from my mid-size east Texas town, I found community in so many diverse spaces on campus. It’s terrifying to think that this could disappear. This attack on affirmative action is rooted in white supremacy and has dangerously painted Asian Americans as a monolith, creating division. Now, I’m reclaiming my identity and using it to unify. “Admissions based on merit has never and will never lead to a classroom full of diverse thought and experience. Affirmative Action is what makes me excited to go to my class sections because it’s allowed for people of different backgrounds to hold space in a historically white, rich school. So I personally think we still have so much more to do in order to further diversify Harvard. Also, as a person being able to overcome racial and socioeconomic barriers to get to the point where they can aspire to attend a school like this shows more merit to me than bubbling some answers on the SAT.” BHH:“Affirmative action is super necessary given this institution’s history of explicitly denying entrance to students of color. But beyond historical injustices, the present system of determining an applicant’s worth relies heavily on instruments and institutions created in and for a white supremacist culture. Not only do we limit our cultural diversity in educational spaces, but we greatly inhibit our ability to know the truth in any subject matter when many perspectives are not readily present as the hegemonic one (which again is only here, and hegemonic, due to centuries of imperialism, slavery, colonialism, racism, and genocide, yet despite all the obvious delegitimizing factors, the whites are still making admissions decisions and make up the vast majority of the faculty. Veritas is impossible in a place like this.”"

This article is not written for the students who put forth and are pushing the SA resolution to denounce Seth Huston’s statements. This article is written for the liberals, the students who don’t engage with the SA or are too afraid to speak up. This is it. Speak now or forever hold your peace. You might have foolishly believed that the anti-free speech regulations wouldn’t affect you as long as you were nice. But we’ve seen time and time again that censorship isn’t about hate. There were no consequences last year when “Kill all landlords” was written on the Hanszen chalkboard. In fact, it was left up for nearly a month. The word “hate” will always be bastardized by the people in charge to censor who they want. That’s one of the reasons why we should never give them the power to regulate what we say. Being kind to others isn’t good enough anymore. If you don’t agree with them, there will be consequences. Just read Seth Huston’s statements. He couldn’t have been any more courteous. His sin was merely thinking for himself rather than reciting exactly what members of the SA wanted him to think. This isn’t a slippery slope; we’re already in free fall. This isn’t going to stop until a lot of us start pushing on the brakes. You and I aren’t activists. We don’t want to take part in the student government, but if we don’t stand together, there won’t be anyone to stand for you when you make the mistake of publicly thinking for yourself. Don’t kid yourself, if the SA can resolve to send a coach to a re-education program fora statement 62% of Americans agree with, they can do it to you too. Their criticism swayed one of their own members to choose to resign (former Will Rice College Senator William Tsai , and they won’t stop until all intellectual diversity is silenced. There’s no bridge they won’t cross in the name of allyship. Encouraging such fragility isn’t constructive for transgender students or the students pushing the resolution either. You can’t learn tough things in life if you’re never willing to hear anything offensive. You can’t tell if an idea is true or not until you’ve given it fair consideration. If I never considered ideas I thought were offensive, I would have essentially the same views as when I was 15. As soon as the students pushing the resolution touch grass outside campus, their echo chamber won’t be able to protect them. The views these students suppressed are going to be the majority opinion.

ubyssey_2022_59,"Sept. 28, 2022 Written byJulianna Yue I guess this is a short memoir of sorts — more, my way of making sense of the world that I navigate every day. A reflection of myself, an investigation into me (and of course the world around me . In a way I don’t fully know what I want to write; I have no prescribed direction for where I want to head, just a blaring white screen staring back at me. It seems that every time you interact with new people, it is expected that you have a full introduction prepared and polished for such an occasion. In university, it’s your major and year, a fun fact perhaps — the obvious question of “who are you?” In conversation this flows easily, no extra thought aside from the nerves of a job interviewer asking, “Tell me about yourself.” The truth is that most people ask out of their robotic and cyclical nature, rather than from a point of interest. Though when a professor asks (and there’s a grade mark attached to how you respond there’s a much more verbatim quality to the way you must present yourself. In today’s world of changing social acceptability and ‘PC’ demands, it seems most appropriate that I start these introductions with my name and pronouns: I’ll do the same below. My name is Julianna Yue. I was born and raised in “Vancouver” on the unceded, ancestral and traditional territories of thexʷməθkʷəy̓əm, Sḵwx̱wú7mesh and Sel̓íl̓witulhNations.I am Chinese from Taishan, Guangdong, and Métis-Cree with roots in Treaty 8 territory (Alberta . This is supposed to define me, or at least situate myself in a world full of people — where I am the other. Those seemingly simple two sentences validate my existence and belonging: something that, as a mixed-race baby, is hard to find. In a way, it allows me to lay everything out right then and there, no waiting for the oh-so-predictable “So, what are you” and “You look so exotic” commentary. However, this then leaves room for the, “Oh, I wouldn’t have guessed that” and “But you don’t look like you’re _____.” Growing up mixed has been complicated — it’s a neverendingly long time of being too little and too much. On one hand you never feel like you re enough of one race to fit in there; on the other you become too different to fit into one sole category. As I’ve gotten older it has become all the more apparent. I can’t speak Cantonese or Michif, and I don’t know half of my own cultural practices. I feel disconnected, making that lack of fitting in even stronger. Whereas some people feel so sure of themselves, there’s always been a sense of longing left deep within me. For what? I’m not entirely sure, maybe just certainty, a concrete identity. With a long-standing history of racism, blood quantum and the value of ‘purity’ I am not surprised at the ignorance applied to those of mixed-race descent. It’s almost as if it’s a taboo that exists solely behind lips pressed tightly. I was surprised to see an argument online of a woman referring to her child as mixed (as opposed to just her child and having various personas on the internet attack her for this choice. This attitude really only showed the dismissal and supposed ‘wrongness’ of being mixed. While I myself am still learning about myself and what it means for me to fit in, I would and will never hide the fact that I am mixed. While I have my own questions and qualms on what it means for me to navigate through society as the other, I know that my heritage and culture has shaped me into the person I am today. From my grandfather’s experience in immigrating from China during Canada s head tax, and my kokum and her siblings being stolen from their home, I feel a deep sense of gratitude in learning from them and listening to their stories. Not only have they provided insight into where and who I’ve come from, they share stories of resilience and the power to resist. Share this articlecopied!

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_19,"Anyone who’s been online at all in the past month will know that Kanye West, who nowlegallygoes by Ye, has been courting plenty of controversy. He’s had quite the year for himself, so much that it has become nearly impossible to keep track or predict what he will be trending for tomorrow. The public antics and social media rants are often inexplicable, and it’s a shame that they seem to cloud his public perception. When peoplesay“man, I miss the old Kanye,” it begs the question: to which Kanye are they alluding? The young, hungry producer whose musical aspirations no one took seriously? The wide-eyed kid from Chicago who rapped about God, social consciousness and internalized racism? The boy genius who brought soul back to hip-hop and served it to the masses? These are things that Kanye is still doing in 2022, and hasn’t stopped doing over the last 20 years since he burst onto the scene. His dreams have always been larger than life. Albeit now, he has a vast amount of wealth, power and influence, and therefore the means to bring these dreams to fruition entirely on his own. People can scoff all they want, but one thing they can’t minimize is his earnesty and will. He will not rest until he proves every last naysayer wrong. Furthermore, to argue that he should regress back to a previous version of himself is a cheap dismissal of the artist he has always been. Kanye didn’t achieve such prominence by being satisfied or comfortable. No matter the height of his successes, he’s always strived for more. Some call it greedy, some call it egotistical — but prolific artists aren’t born out of complacency. Kanye is arguably the only artist of his caliber with such an uncompromising vision that he’s willing to antagonize his audience in the process — sometimes to his detriment. Say what you will about certain aesthetic choices he’s made within the last five years, a few of which are definitely head-scratchers, but his sincerity and commitment to the vision is noteworthy. We can go back and forth over the quality of some of his recent work, but at least he never grows complacent or allows obstacles to deter him. His ideas seem so fantastical that they border on the absurd at times, yet logistics or corporate interests never seem to interfere with their execution. While he might function as more of a gatekeeper these days than an underdog, he nevertheless remainsat odds with the industry. He seems to be in a perpetual dispute over something, whether he’s railing against record labels and streaming platforms, or luxury fashion houses and political parties. It’s beensaidthat Kanye has become the very machine he’s always fought against, but he’s actually fighting the establishment from a machine he has built on his own. Some might argue that his art has suffered because of his hubris, or since his involvement with the Kardashians, or due to his forays into other creative and political ventures. However, it’s futile to constantly compare whatever Kanye is currently doing artistically to whatever bygone version of himself that people seem to prefer. From the time he was the “old Ye,” he had odds to overcome. Kanye’s entire career arc is both extraordinary and tragic. And yet, calamity fuels his creative work. His first hit single, “Through the Wire,” came out of anear-fatal car wreckthat left his jaw broken and needing to be literally wired shut. What could have been a potentially career-ending circumstance for a rapper was actually a triumph, as he delivered his verses despite the metal gear that kept his jaw intact. Soon after a meteoric rise to fame, his mother, Donda, tragicallydiedduring an elective cosmetic procedure that he was financing. Although his personal life has been plagued by immense suffering and trauma, his artistry has continued to mature and push the boundaries of popular music. The mental gymnastics involved in supporting and defending Kanye can be admittedly tiresome. In this cultural climate, it seems to have become difficult for many people to compartmentalize their emotions and feelings of betrayal from their evaluations of the actual craft itself.Kanye’s cult of personalityand his polarizing presence has rendered so manyincapableof judging the quality of his work with fairness and good-faith. Perhaps we should not look to Kanye as being an informed or prudent spokesperson on important issues. Rather, we should look to him solely for his aesthetic instincts. Kanye’simpacton culture cannot be overstated. Try resisting the urge to bop your head to the beat of “Jesus Walks” or deny the nostalgia of an album like “Graduation.” Look at the numbers he does onstreamingservices or theover a billionin revenue his Yeezy sneaker empire nets annually, and there’s no denying it. He’ll always be a complex and contradictory figure, and will likely continue to inspire mixed feelings in both fans and critics alike. It is possible to be frustrated by him, and at the same time show him both the reverence and empathy he deserves. Behind the messiah complex, he is only human.

stanforddaily_2022_85,"This article was written by the Terra staff for the 2021-2022 academic year.Terra is one of the largest co-ops, tucked in Cowell Cluster (right behind Vaden and it’s the unofficial LGBTQIA+ theme dorm. This means that we center and prioritize the needs of queer and trans folk on this campus, and globally. Terra values the loving community that has emerged from centering QT folk but is simultaneously aware of the ways Stanford and co-op communities exacerbate exclusion on the basis of race, class and ability. We’re committing to centering Black and Indigenous QT folk, disabled QT folk, undocumented QT folk and other historically marginalized members of our communities. Queer and trans liberation cannot happen without overturning systems of white supremacy, settler colonialism and capitalism. As a result, we have a zero-tolerance policy against any form of discrimination, including homophobia, transphobia, racism, misogyny, ableism, classism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and more. We will also not tolerate any form of assault, abuse or violence. Our community is our home, and we want all of our residents to feel safe. “The issue is not with trans people. It’s with policies that allow men to enter spaces designed to keep women safe. And it’s with the people who take advantage of those policies to harass, intimidate, assault and terrorize women in such places.” —Lucy Kross Wallace. On March 31, 2022, the International Trans Day of Visibility, The Stanford Daily published thearticle“From the community | I stand with J.K. Rowling, and so should you“filled with transphobic sentiments and bad-faith arguments about the experiences of J.K. Rowling to further the author’s harmful transphobic beliefs. As the student staff of Terra, Stanford’s only queer-trans themed dorm, we found it necessary to respond immediately. This article is nothing short of the pure rot of the American culture war which has regurgitated the same points since 2014 and presents them as revelatory truth; the author probably does not care for either issue except to grift from the outrageous claims she has consistently published for the past two years. The term “outrage politics” encapsulates this best: the author hides behind terms such as “free speech,” “tolerance” and “liberal-democratic values.” If this was about standing with women, she would discuss single mothers across the country who struggle to feed their children, trans girls who are abused and ostracized by their families and the domestic labor that women are expected to do without compensation. Yet, she would rather “stand” with an elite celebrity who hides in her vampire castle and writes snarky articles about the downtrodden of our world. We say downtrodden because it is known that trans folk are ostracized and consistently subjected to abuse by both civil society and the state. All over America, trans people are at risk of violence and death. They may often need to enter precarious situations due to the lack of support they receive from traditional institutions such as family, legal institutions and school. Even at Stanford, an oasis from the worst that trans folk encounter, TGNC (transgender and gender nonconforming students are universally at the highest risk of violence. The results of the2019 AAU surveyconducted by Stanford show that 30% of TGNC undergrads have experienced unwanted sexual contact by their fourth year, and 55% have experienced harassment. It is laughable to say that J.K. Rowling “represents” women: she has more in common with the rich men who sell out our country and make life unbearable for women. But the delusion of the culture war obscures the obvious under abstract terms and knee-jerk arguments. The populist right want to believe they are for the common people, as the author posits herself as an ally to women. Yet, she utilizes women as fodder to protect a multi-millionaire, just as the populist right protect any politician, celebrity or whomever else they believe to be “oppressed” by a mob. It is delusional, and insulting to any cause that is truly “for the people.” At Stanford, we often repeat the adage ‘assume intent, acknowledge impact’ as we navigate issues that impact vulnerable community members. However, the Rowling article is filled with transphobic sentiments obscured by “rationality.” As we began with the article, the author states how “the issue is not with trans people. It’s with policies that allow men to enter spaces designed to keep women safe. And it’s with the people who take advantage of those policies to harass, intimidate, assault and terrorize women in such places.” This is an intentional jab at calling trans women “men,” which is a tired joke that sounds more like a middle school sneer than the remarks of a reputable adult. We cannot assume that you had any good intentions towards trans people. It is very clear that we cannot change your mind or educate you further on gender expansiveness, but we still felt moved to write this statement as part of the queer community. There is no place for transphobia at Stanford, and we all have a responsibility to ensure that. The Rowling article calls for empathy for Ms. Rowling amidst the doxxing and death threats she is receiving. Terra staff do not condone any form of violence: physical, sexual, emotional, verbal or digital. Ms. Rowling does not deserve to fear for her life, no matter how vile her positions are. We believe that harassment towards Ms. Rowling is wrong and should be criticized. However, we must ask you; why do you have empathy in abundance for Ms. Rowling, a wealthy, white, cis celebrity who has used her platform to endanger vulnerable people — yet such little empathy for your trans classmates and community members? Ms. Rowling wrote about her own experiences as a survivor in further defense of the vile and harmful beliefs she has. Again, it is awful that these things have happened to her, but it gives her no right to be malicious towards our trans community members. Why do we prioritize her needs and her trauma over the experiences of trans survivors, trans elderly, trans youth and trans children? Trans people are globally at the most risk for gender-based violence and share similar traumatic experiences. Finally, we as Terra staff are incredibly disappointed in the author, the Opinions editors and The Stanford Daily at large for publishing such a transphobic, ignorant article on the same day as International Trans Day of Visibility. As Stanford University has a very high population of LGBT community members, it felt like a slap in the face to an integral, yet vulnerable part of the Stanford community. The Stanford Daily is read far beyond Stanford, from Bay Area residents to powerful alumni to prospective students. Statements like this do not reflect us at all. As the author writes,the rest of us do have a choice. The right one, however, will never be rooted in transphobia.

ubyssey_2022_22,"June 6, 2022 Written byDaphnée Lévesque Scrolling through Instagram used to make me feel left out, like a failure and not very empowered. I compared myself to my peers and I felt like I was running behind on life, even though that wasn’t the case at all. We all follow different paths, and achieve milestones based on our own history and life experiences. I ve learned to curate my social media pages and I found that Instagram can be a source of comfort for me. Today, I’m going to share my favourite mental health-related Instagram accounts. When I follow accounts that focus on mental health, self-care and therapy, it makes me feel better about my struggles and the fact I am not alone. Nedra Glover Tawwab is a therapist, writer and the author of one of my favourite books calledSet Boundaries, Find Peace. She describes herself as a “boundary expert” and her Instagram grid is filled with little golden nuggets of knowledge. She knows a lot about relationships, self-love and how to setboundaries with yourself and others. She also gives practical tips, which I have found useful. Dr. Jen is a neuropsychologist, coach and author. Her posts are “curated coping tools to #rewirewellness” and she has written a book calledQuick Calm: Easy Meditations to Short-Circuit Stress Using Mindfulness & Neuroscience. I think that Dr. Jen is insightful and gives practical tips as well. I find her posts to be relatable, interesting and validating of people’s life experiences and struggles.

stanforddaily_2022_11,"Last month, the Undergraduate Senate unanimously passed aresolutionto address sexual violence. This resolution contained a number of sound and actionable changes that will make our campus safer. I wholeheartedly commend the resolution’s sponsors, authors and supporters for continuing this fight. But this issue goes beyond undergraduate education to the graduate schools, most notably the School of Medicine. I have worked at the School of Medicine in various roles for nearly twenty years. During that time, I have consistently observed a severe problem with sexual misconduct by the school’s faculty. In the last decade, there have been at least three Stanford physicians who have faced criminal investigations relating to sex-related crimes: Dr. Dylan O’Connor from Pediatrics wassentencedto prison this year for sexting with a minor. Professor John Giacomini — the longtime director of Stanford’s cardiology fellowship program — wassentencedto jail over the summer for sexually assaulting a former trainee in the workplace; and Assistant Professor Dan Garza from the Department of Orthopedic Surgery took his own life in 2013 while underinvestigationfor allegedly drugging and assaulting multiple members of the Stanford community. In addition, Professor Jose Montoya from Infectious Diseases wasfiredin 2019 after accusations of “unsolicited sexual acts with his female employees, among many other instances of harassment and misconduct,” as reported by the Daily at the time. The School of Medicine has shown significant resistance to publicly commenting on the problem generally and to publicly disclosing even the existence of individual incidents or perpetrators. In the case of Giacomini, it took three and a half years,threeindependentinvestigations, a criminalindictment, a guilty plea andconvictionand several stories in the media before the school formally acknowledged to their faculty that any incident had occurred, finally doing so via a department-wide email in March 2022. The school has never formally acknowledged the accusations against Garza. Several years ago, I reported a student’s off-campus stalking by a faculty member to the university. I later noticed the faculty had been scrubbed from his department’s webpages, and I was informed by the student that after an investigation, he had been allowed to quietly resign from Stanford rather than be publicly fired. He now works at another university. There are grave consequences from the institution failing to publicly acknowledge sexual misconduct by faculty. Victims feel even more isolated and unvalidated, robbing them of full justice. It also increases the risk of professional retaliation against victims since perpetrators can more easily sabotage careers from behind the scenes when their misconduct and true motivations are unknown to those around them. Fear of retaliation remains one of the biggestbarriersto women reporting sexual violence in academia. Lack of transparency hides the scope of the problem from rank-and-file members of the faculty, as well as from staff, residents and students. Most importantly, a lack of public accountability of past perpetrators prevents the deterrence of ongoing and future perpetrators. They have relatively little to fear when the most likely outcome from sexually assaulting a colleague is only a need to quietly change jobs to another institution — one which will be totally unaware of their past misdeeds. The School of Medicine cannot assume that changes in culture, attitudes and behaviors that may be occurring elsewhere at Stanford will simply diffuse into our corner of campus. I ask of the Undergraduate and Faculty Senates, Sexual Violence-Free Stanford, the Title IX Office and our administrators that future campus-wide efforts to address sexual violence include the medical school as an equally important partner and target for change. To that end, the Undergraduate Senate should add a sixth individual to the list of professors they called out by name as having “committed heinous acts of sexual violence” for which they should be fired and stripped of honors: Dr. Mark Perlroth, emeritus faculty in the Department of Medicine. Dr. Perlroth’s egregious alleged harassment of a student and later intern — infamous enough to befeaturedin the New York Times decades before #MeToo — resulted in him beingcensuredby the university. Nonetheless, he subsequently resumed his prior duties, which included over a decade of additional service on themed school admissions panel. While Dr. Perlroth’s harassment may seem like ancient history,precedentexists from other institutions for stripping emeritus status of faculty for long passed misconduct. While only a symbolic gesture, it would nevertheless be an important one, signaling that sexual predators among the physicians and scientists of the medical school are not immune to full culpability and consequences. Had Dr. Perlroth been adequately punished thirty years ago, his colleagues Drs. Montoya and Giacomini, among others, would have felt less emboldened to subsequently commit their own horrible acts. Deterrence is a critical component of punishment. When punishment from prior acts is too lenient, deterrence against future acts will be inadequate. It is important for the university and School of Medicine to conduct a fair and confidential investigation into any accusation of sexual misconduct by faculty, via a consistent and transparent process. This includes ample opportunity for the accused to defend themselves. However, once that investigation has been completed, if the accusation is found to have merit, three things must occur: First, punishment proportional to the misconduct needs to be handed out. Second, the identity of the perpetrator and the nature of their misconduct should be made public to the extent possible while simultaneously protecting the identity of the victims. Third, victims need to be supported and protected against retaliation. Our institution failed on these actions with Perlroth thirty years ago, and it continues to fail with perpetrators today. While combating sexual violence is everyone’s responsibility, there is only so much that faculty members can do as individuals. Even when we feel adequately trained and empowered to report acts of misconduct, doing so can feel like a game of whack-a-mole. One perpetrator is sanctioned or quietly leaves, and another shows up somewhere else. As part of a broader plan for the University and School of Medicine to address sexual misconduct, there must be sufficient, proportional and public punishment of faculty who have violated our community’s standards around this issue. This change will provide victims a greater sense of support, validation and justice; it will empower bystanders to report witnessed incidents; and it will help deter would-be perpetrators from future acts of misconduct.

thetech_mit_2022_48,"On April 4 and 5, many of MIT’s graduate students will participate in a confidentialelectionto decide whether theUnited Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE will represent them for collective bargaining. We’ve previously describedour position, thelimits of unionization and labor bargainingin graduate education, and thegains won for all MIT graduate studentsthrough our current collaborative processes. Today we share some of the risks, losses, and costs that graduate students might face if a union is elected: The risk of strikes and disruptions:Strikes and delays can occur during contract negotiations. In fact, theUE’s policy book 2021–23calls for “the continued use of the strike as the primary weapon against the employer.”It took Columbia’s student union more than five years to reach a first contract following its election, and students were on strike for a total of 132 days during this period.In all cases, between 475 and 1,504 days elapsed before a first contract was reached between student unions and private universities, and strikes are very possible during negotiations, putting academic progress at risk and important financial and policy improvements on hold. The likely loss of a nimble, responsive, and student-driven stipend process:Harvard and Columbia’s students are now locked into multi-year, union-negotiated contracts with 3% increases in the out years. By contrast,our student-led process considers cost-of-living increases on an annual basisand is responsive to high-inflation pressures such as those that exist today. As a result of this process, MIT’s stipends are already higher than those at nearly every private university that has a graduate student union. Costly union dues:Union members may pay dues of up to $550 per year, without any guarantee of better benefits or compensation. The UE and its supporters in theMIT Graduate Student Unionargue that a union would change campus for the better. It may also change it for the worse: The UE would introduce a third-party entity on campus:The UE is a national organization withits own political and financial interests, which may or may not align with graduate students’ interests. The UE can use member dues to advance these interests, including supporting its broader national organization, which issomething students opposed to the UE have raised concerns about. In addition to the UE’s national political agenda, the new local union leadership would likely have its own priorities that students may or may not agree with. The UE would be able to pressure students and may continue to use students’ personal information, even after a victory:We’ve received reports during this campaign of students feeling pressured by union supporters. Unfortunately, behavior like this is likely to persist if the UE is successful. The union would need to seek new student members, garner student support for their bargaining and political positions, and likely persuade students to strike. And it would still be able to accesspersonal contact information that MIT was required to produce last month. (Students may contact ourInstitute Discrimination & Harassment Response OfficeorOffice of Student Conduct and Community Standardsif they have experienced any conduct that violates MIT policy . The UE will impact student-advisor relationships:We know that theoverwhelming majority of graduate studentshave a positive view of the quality of academic advising and guidance as well as their interactions with faculty.Institute Professor Phillip Sharp and Professor Alan Grossman have authored anop-ed inThe Techabout the consequences a union would have on student-advisor relationships. Among their observations:“a unionized environment … reduces flexibility in favor of a highly structured relationship between manager and workers. We believe that such industry-framed relationships are ill-suited to the nature of and rapidly evolving opportunities in graduate education, where individuality and flexibility are necessary to foster a dynamic trajectory for graduate students.” Every eligible student shouldcritically assess the different positions in this debate and voteon April 4 or 5in Morss Hall in Walker Memorial.This election’s outcome will be determined by a simple majority of those who vote but will be binding on everyone in theproposed bargaining unit— even for students who don’t vote or who don’t want a union."
crimson_2022_82,"The world order based on cooperative security and globalization became severely threatened on Feb. 24, 2022, when the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine, an independent and increasinglydemocratic nation. As Ukraine fearlessly fights for its future, the Harvard community has expressed its supportby conducting an anti-war rallyandamplifying the voices of Ukrainianson campus. Indeed, Harvard is known in the United States and abroad for this kind of advocacy. Fromraising emergency aid for displaced Afghansafter the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan to takinga strong stance on racial injusticesduring the Black Lives Matter protests of summer 2020, Harvard students, as the citizen-leaders of tomorrow, lead the opinions in human rights circles nationwide and create an impact beyond campus. But today, the Harvard administration and the activists within the student body must be even more proactive in their advocacy for the Ukrainian cause, human rights, and global security than ever before. The war in Ukraine is a unique 21st-century case of a people’s fight for the right to determine their future against an enemy that is several times larger. Ukrainians have inspired the world with their ability to withstand the attack for so long. What lies behind this determination are the values that every American holds dear. Ukraine prides itself on the unlimited freedoms to peacefully protest, criticize the government, and elect its public servants. Even as some neighboring post-Soviet countries slid back into authoritarianism, Ukraine managed to stay democratic, and its people have never been intimidated by a more powerful bully. Back in 2014, when the pro-Russian government restricted the right to protest,hundreds of thousands went to the streets, fighting for their right tospeak out. Ukrainian people put their lives on the line then — and continue to do so today — because democracy and the freedom to pursue your own social, cultural, and political development are at the center of the Ukrainian identity. The Harvard student body should stand for Ukraine by using the privilege that Ukrainians are dying for: the democratic right to pressure the government for action. Students should write and call their local representatives and urge them to announce their support for Ukraine. The entire Harvard community must demand that elected officials speak out about the need for broader humanitarian and defense assistance and request support for ano-fly zone, an area over which Russian aircraft are not permitted to fly. This restriction entails shooting down Russian violators and will prevent Russia from using warplanes to attack civilians on the ground. Action is urgently needed to prevent massive human rights violations. Vladimir Putin’s quest for dominance yields unprecedented violations in Ukraine, and the country is presently on the brink of one of the biggest humanitarian crises that Europe has seen within the last few decades. Ukrainians trapped by Russian attackslack food and supplies, andthere have been allegations ofrising sexual violencein cities occupied by Russian invaders. Additionally, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations hasallegedthat Putin prepared a list of LGBTQI+ persons to be killed or sent to camps if he takes over Ukraine. Companies in the United States that work with or in Russia indirectly support this immense suffering. The Harvard community should boycott companies that have ties with the Kremlin, and the student body should request that companies they work for restrict any business relations or partnerships with companies operating in Russia. The Harvard administration needs to release information on whether the University has any indirect investments in Russia, and if any exist, suspend those immediately. Lastly, activists must act now to prevent a war in other European countries. Putin has not only laid out a threat to Ukrainian borders but also put forth a vision of an imperial Russia. In his November 2021addressto the Russian people, Putin stated that some republics that were once a part of the Soviet Union have unjustifiably been given independence, forcing us to confront the inevitable question: Who is next? Which other independent European country will Putin destroy in his quest for power? Will he lay a claim on Baltic countries that were formerly a part of the Soviet Union, and are presently a part of NATO? Harvard students must join protests and show support to Ukraine not only for the sake of Ukraine, but also to prevent a catastrophe in other European countries. The leaders of tomorrow should not stay idle in the face of this global danger. As a proud Ukrainian American, I offer Harvard a clear call for activism: Everyone in this community must use their power to stand for freedom, protect humanity against an emerging authoritarian regime, and help defend world peace.

wildcat_arizona_2022_53,"With school in full swing, you may have started to get some (or many emails from ZonaZoo. The more athletically inclined among us might have already had their sports tickets booked, face paint ready and jerseys hanging clean in the closet. The less sporty among us may not have a clue what ZonaZoo is or what it means for the students not anxiously awaiting the first tailgate of the season. These are the students who may prefer to stay in with a book or movie on game day – the ones who diligently avoid the crowds surrounding Arizona Stadium during football season because, let’s face it, that’s a nightmare. Whether you fall into the first category or the second, the University of Arizona still welcomes you with open arms into its sports world with ZonaZoo passes. So if you’re wondering what membership is right for you to enjoy sports year-round, take a look at the line-up below and you’ll be sure to score the perfect pass for you. ZonaZoo Starter Membership: Free If you’re a freshman unsure about your commitment to Arizona sports, this is the pass for you. Included in every student’s athletic fee, theZonaZoo Starter Membershipis basically free (i.e., there is no extra cost for all students. This pass gets you into every UA athletic game except for men’s basketball and football. Start off with this pass if you’re wondering whether or not to leave the comfort of home for a sports game. The allure of the couch may win out, but with the Starter Membership, you can dip your toes in the water without having to commit more time and money than you might actually have. “Blue” ZonaZoo Membership: $100 Are you a sports fan not quite ready to go to bat for a more expensive pass? TheBlue ZonaZoo Membershiphas got you covered. Not only do you get admission to Arizona home football games, but you are also admitted to all home games for baseball, softball, volleyball, gymnastics, soccer and women’s basketball. In addition to home game admission for most Arizona sports, the Blue pass gives you special invitations to ZonaZoo events, and a free tee shirt so you can rep your favorite team in true UA style. Be aware that this pass requires Wildcats to reserve tickets in advance for home football games; so make sure you’re ready to pounce when games are announced. White ZonaZoo Membership: $100 Sometimes the UA can feel a little undergraduate-focused. Not to worry though, there’s a place for sports-minded grad students, too. With theWhite ZonaZoo Pass, graduate students who have paid their athletic fee can get admission to all sports including men’s basketball and football – if you reserve a ticket in advance. This membership still includes grad students in the crazy chaos that is ZonaZoo without having to make the commitment some of the other passes require. However, unlike the Blue membership, you’ll have to bring your own tee shirts to sport that UA spirit. Put those thesis-crafting minds to work on a great shirt design and earn a few points with your peers for your school spirit. RELATED:An A-Z guide to Arizona Athletics Red ZonaZoo Membership: $150 So you like sports; but do you really, really like sports? If so, theRed ZonaZoo Membershipwill be a slam dunk for you. This pass is all about University of Arizona basketball. In addition to the perks offered by the Blue Pass, Red Pass holders get admission to all men’s and women’s basketball games and post-season tournament tickets for men’s basketball. You’ll be able to spread the love for UA basketball with this pass: Red ZonaZoo holders also get priority for purchasing UA Men’s Basketball Student Holiday Packs. Does Dad desperately need a basketball-themed Christmas mug? He sure does, and with this pass, you can be the perfect kid and finally make Dad proud. It’s important to remember that with this pass you must reserve your tickets for men’s basketball. So if you’re a diehard Arizona basketball fan, procrastinate that assignment a little more to make time to reserve tickets for the best games of the season. “All In” Membership: $450 Freshmen who are ready to foot the big bill for ZonaZoo (or pass it off to their parents , need to check out the“All In” Pass. This pass gets you all the benefits of the Red pass – so you’ll still get that free tee shirt you’re dying to wear – but this will last for all four years of your time at UA instead of just one. This pass is definitely a home run. ZonaZoo might cater to Wildcats who love each and every sport the University of Arizona has to offer, but there is still a place for students who may not know the difference between a goal and a basket (guilty . Check out the great ZonaZoo passes UA has to offer for another way to get involved on campus and rep the red and blue. Follow Sophie Applin onTwitter.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_35,"During the month of February, there seems to be a revival of the conversation over whether Black History Month should even exist. Of course it should. Especially in the context of our education system, Black History Month is regarded by some of its detractors as one-dimensional and limited in scope. Often, American history highlights only “the good ones,” or the pacifists, such as Martin Luther King Jr. or Jackie Robinson, and pays very little homage to more radical Black figures like Malcolm X or Angela Davis, thussanitizing Black historyin order to make it palatable to white America. Additionally, there are people in the Black community who feel that singling out Black history for just one month — the shortest month of the year, no less — only serves to downplay its significance and contribute to its erasure in virtually every other month of the year. The remainder of which, by default, are in service to white history. Those on the outside looking in — aka non-Black people — might also take issue with singling-out Black history. Aren’t race-specific commemorations counter to American values and ideals, focusing too much on our differences rather than what we share in common? Why isn’t there a history month for white people or Asian-Americans? Isn’t Black history simply American history? These are nice sentiments, but the truth of the matter is that there is no single, shared experience through this country’s history, nor its present. One’s experience in America is largely dependent on the color of their skin. While many of us are able to enjoy the immense sense of freedom and dignity endowed to us in this country, we cannot ignore the socioeconomic disparities and the social structures that persist in oppressing certain minorities — particularly the Black community. Part of the point in highlighting Black history is to reinforce, however, that the color of one’s skin doesn’t have to define or limit one’s experience. At times like these, where race relations are tense and thethreat of historical erasure looms, it is vital to promote these discussions and continue to honor Black achievement. In theory,color blindnessseems like a commendable idea and something to strive for, but we do not have that luxury here in America. Though Black Americans are indeed Americans, the assertion that we should abandon all notions of race in the discussion of American history would undermine everything that is worth celebrating about Black history. To imply that a singular American identity ought to come before a Black identity is frankly, insulting. Let’s not allow the recent backlash against Black History Month and the right wing’sweaponization of “critical race theory”to distract us from the purpose of Black History Month — which is not to scold the American people and our institutions for their shortcomings, of which there were and continue to be many. Rather, we do it to honor the excellence of many great Black American scholars, activists, athletes, artists and agents of social change in the midst of racism and inequality. This commemorative month exists for good reason, and to do away with it would only further inflame race relations. It is a time to allow the Black community to regain control over their narrative, and to instill future generations with a sense of pride and self-worth. The celebration of Black History Month will invariably mean a great deal to some, and less to others. While it can be a difficult subject matter to navigate, especially as an observer with no personal claim to such history, there should be no question that it is sacred and here to stay.

rice_thresher_2022_69,"ByAnna Rajagopal1/11/22 10:03pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. The Rice University course “Critical Dialogues on Diversity” is now a requirement for all new studentsas of the fall of 2021. Much like CTIS, this course is a direct response to the heightened awareness of a culture of accountability surrounding existing power structures. As a transfer to Rice and a junior at the university, I had to take this course as a new matriculant. However, I came into the class as a non-cis person of color with a history of student organization and community building surrounding the centering of colonized and exploited identities. This gave me a unique vantage point with regard to observing the way the course was taught and responded to. Rice’s “Dialogues on Diversity” doesn’t address the problem at hand: historically white institutions of higher education fundamentally disenfranchise colonized and exploited peoples through the continual perpetuation of white, colonial, casteist, capitalist violence. Addressing this basic reality requires more than a course that only serves to benefit white (and other privileged identity students. We need tangible investment in the lives of Black and Indigenous people and other people of color within the broader Rice community. To understand why this course is an insufficient attempt at addressing the concerns of marginalized community members, it’s crucial to be able to conceptualize the framework it sits within. Because diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (as we know them today are forced to function within the framework of white supremacy, they are merely further extensions of that power. They serve the same function as any other racist university policy or legislation: to disenfranchise. Institutional entities like Rice use diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as a corporate cover-uptoolof response to public outrage rather than as a meaningful attempt at tangible change, all while simultaneously neglecting the needs of oppressed community members. These initiatives function as a stopgap for institutional and communal violence; it’s like putting a bandaid on a bullet hole. My personal experiences with the section of the course I took further reflect the issues inherent to Rice’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Not only was intersectionality misdefined in the content of the course, but the concept of intersectionality — particularly in the case of race and racism — was not one that was given any sort of precedence within the course itself. The content taught contained no confrontation of whiteness, white privilege, white power or white supremacy, but rather incorrectly asserted that benefitting from whiteness can be negated by other aspects of one’s own identity, like an accent. At times, I heard jokes being made in the classroom that were explicitly transphobic — the course content containing no inclusion of marginalized genders. Neurodivergent and disabled identities were completely excluded from mention, and there was no discussion of how ableism impacts members of the Rice community. The course wasn’t well planned or executed, and instead of helping, it harmed. Perhaps the most telling class session was the time we spent nearly the full hour discussing the capital benefit that diversity can bring to institutions. I left the classroom feeling more unsafe on campus than I had before, knowing that my peers harbor opinions about my identity that could endanger me and that the university doesn’t care. This is why many organizers advocate for abolition rather than reform: Because you cannot reform a system that is doing exactly what it was designed to. If Rice wants to help oppressed community members, particularly BIPOC and other people of color, it needs to invest in us rather than solely in our white peers. Taking a course made for white people that barely confirms the humanity of nonwhite students is humiliating, and it doesn’t provide us with any tangible support to navigate the continued violence we are subjected to. Instead of checking off the “diversity box” with a crash course on how to be a decent human being, Rice could put its money where its mouth is; one of the most powerful forms of allyship that white, colonial peoples and institutions can offer to exploited and colonized communities is monetary investment through redistribution of wealth and resources. Diversity, equity and inclusion is meaningless if Rice isn’t going to work on building tangible support networks for oppressed community members. Rice likes to boast about its diverse community demographics and course content, but if incoming students, faculty and staff of color aren’t given the ability to seek refuge from the constant onslaught of racism and white supremacy that is so present in our lives, there’s nothing to brag about. Bringing more of us into a system designed to hurt us without providing any sort of structural foundation of benefit for our health and safety only causes more harm. Establishing university-sponsored BIPOC-led and facilitated community groups would be a start. As would hiring Black and Indigenous licensed therapists and counselors to address the mental and emotional needs of the existing BIPOC student body, or taking down the statue of that slave-owner that sits in the middle of our campus. Without providing oppressed students with essential items to ensure that our basic humanity is acknowledged on campus, without a significant overhaul of how the diversity, equity and inclusion course is conceptualized, prepared, and taught, that mandatory one hour class — as is — only serves the privileged. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

Seo-Young Chu M.A. ’01 stopped going by the name “Jennie” after she was raped in 2000 by a Stanford professor, she said. Her contact information can be found here: https: hcommons.org/members/schu/ Dear Stanford: It should never have come to this. Dear Stanford: I’ve given youso many opportunitiesto correct your mistakes. Dear Stanford: When youcreate traumatized alumni, ask your traumatized alumni for donations, betray our trust again and again, continually fail to learn from your blunders, and have the audacity to claim you are “helpless,” all while remaining obscenely rich, you cannot call yourself a “good school.” Dear Stanford: This was supposed to be an “open letter” but my trauma is radioactive and this letter is mutating, turning into something else. Dear Stanford: You had decades to prevent the Barletta situation. Decades. All that wealth — and for what? Truly a waste. You have no excuse. By the way, when I address “Stanford” here, I am addressing those in positions of power and authority. The more power you have, and the more you are being paid, the more accountable you are to your community and for Stanford’s failures. Dear Stanford: In 2000, you let your “star” faculty violate my 22-year-old self. That’s how my career began — with violence I am still struggling to comprehend. I was so naive and inexperienced I was confused by what was happening. I — Dear Stanford: Now you’resending your rape culture to CUNYwhere I work and teach? How dare you! How dare you invade my home? Dear Stanford: This letter is repetitive because traumatic re-living is repetitive and you continue to resurrect those hideous memories by making headlines about rape culture on your campus. Dear Stanford: My parents sacrificed a lot to give me a life less chaotic and violent than theirs. They trusted you to keep their daughter safe from the “bad” behavior of serial abusers. Their trust was betrayed — not once, not twice, but over and over and over and over and over again. Dear Stanford: CUNY is underfunded. You are overfunded. What is the correct way to redress such inequality? I don’t know. I do know that letting your rape culture make contact with CUNY students is the wrong way. Dear Stanford: Colleagues were “repeatedly asked to ‘babysit’ Barletta”? In what universe is such infantilization of a serial abuser acceptable? Dear Stanford: You cannot possibly claim that you are “helpless” here, that you “had no idea,” that you are understaffed or under-resourced. Dear Stanford: When I was a 22-year-old first-year Ph.D. student in your English Department, your “star” faculty raped and harassed me. I was unable, under such circumstances, to excel, to collaborate with colleagues (he isolated me , unable at times to work (I was too busy trying to avoid being raped , often unable to think at all. And my abuser did this to others at Stanford too. Not only did my abuser harm multiple students, but you continue to allowmultiple people in positions of power and authority to harm generations of students and employees. Dear Stanford: How could you. How could youname that library in his honorafter you yourself punished him for what he did to me? He used one of thosebooksto — I won’t finish this sentence. I won’t go there. Not again. Dear Stanford: You have squandered my patience and goodwill. Dear Stanford:Archuleta,Barletta,Fliegelman,Moretti— why? Just — why? Dear Stanford: This is not how I want to be spending my summer. I was actually working on my book project when news about Vincent Barletta “mentoring” CUNY students reset my brain’s time zone to#PTSD. For the past month, I’ve been re-living the year 2000 (when your “star” faculty violated my 22-year-old self . Dear Stanford: Fuck you forcovering upthe abuse and the punishment. Dear Stanford: You are Victor Frankenstein and my suffering is the creature you made. Take responsibility for your creation. Dear Stanford: I had just turned 22 years old. I was naive and inexperienced. I was a first-year graduate student, new to the profession, new to teaching, new to California, new to Stanford. He was tenured. He was powerful. He was in his 50s.He had been a Stanford institution for decades. This is disjointed because I’m reliving it all over again. Shortly after he violated me, I was hospitalized. Shortly after I was discharged from the hospital, I gave aguest lecture on Seneca Falls and women’s rights. His response was to tell me I forgot to mention women’s right to sexual pleasure. There are gaps here because trauma is nonlinear, trauma broke my sense of time. At some point you conducted an investigation. As aresultofthe investigation, which was a brutal experience, you punished my abuser by suspending him for two years without pay. Some of his colleagues had the gall to blame me for the whole debacle. Dear Stanford: By enabling rape culture and abuse to flourish, you promote hostile thinking environments. You poison ideas. You destroy minds. You weaken intellectual communities. You prevent work from happening. Dear Stanford: Every minute, hour, day, week, month, year, decade of your silence and inaction is disrupting my “career,” is relevant to my work, has shaped my sense of self as an academic. Dear Stanford: I’ve never sued you. I’ve generously given you free feedback. I’ve extended every deadline. I’ve been more than patient with you. I’ve spent countless hourseducating youandcleaning up your messes. Dear Stanford: By criticizing you I am not “attacking” your students, alumni, and workers. I am trying to make your campus better. Safer. More hospitable to learning. By speaking out like this I am trying to be a good alumna. I hope you are paying attention. Dear Stanford: The truth is that my career started with rape. My career has been shaped by rape. My sense of who I am as an academic: shaped by rape. The gaps in my CV are trauma-generated plot holes that lead to Northern California in the year 2000. Dear Stanford: I’m angry, I’m disabled, I have work to do, I have a migraine. I want to lie down and shut my eyes and rest. But this is too important. I can’t rest until CUNY is safe from your rape culture. Dear Stanford: Have you even read “A Refuge for Jae-in Doe”? The whole point of my sharing all that pain — and in a language your English Department would understand: sonnets! The Western Canon! English (Major ! — was to prevent more students from being harmed. Dear Stanford: I am as “proud” to have a degree from your school as I would be “proud” to sport a blood diamond. Yes, the degree may glitter. But how much pain, injustice, conflict, humiliation, abuse, and violence does such glitter belie? Dear Stanford: I am ashamed to be associated with you. Dear Stanford: If I were to write a book about your response to my requests for answers and answerability, most of the book’s pages would be blank. Vacuous. Empty. Dear Stanford: Emptiness, too, is a response. And by definition it is worthless. Dear Stanford: Speaking out does not come naturally to me. Speaking out does not come naturally to many of us. In fact, it hurts. But remaining silent hurts even more. Don’t let our advocacy be in vain. Dear Stanford: Prove to me that CUNY students are safe from the toxic rape culture that flourishes on your campus. Dear Stanford: You are indebted to me.

state_press_2022_9,"Lack of housing is a big issue, especially for low-income students, as it adds to the stress of their daily lives. As rooms in residence halls are filled, fewer students are able to live on campus. Instead of focusing on projects like Mirabella at ASU, and new research buildings such as the Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building 7, ASU should provide for students and guarantee them a place to live. I m off-campus and live an hour away. I couldn t get housing because the housing downtown is so limited, said Chloe Hom, sophomore medical studies major. Lack of housing is a big issue, especially for low-income students, as it adds to the stress of their daily lives. The inability to meet basic needs leaves them with negative academic performance, lowers the ability to concentrate in class, and causes feelings of sadness and hopelessness. There is anASU subredditthread dedicated to this problem where students complain ASU doesn t have enough housing for the number of students they accept. One user said, It doesn t matter how inclusive ASU is if they don t provide the resources beyond an acceptance letter. ASU has an acceptance rate of88.2%. In addition, ASU has been increasing its total enrollment. In Fall 2020, ASU had a total enrollment of 128,788, rising to 135,729 in 2021. With a continuous increase in students, ASU should expect their housing crisis to worsen. Meanwhile, more upper-division accommodations are being turned into freshman housing and are no longer offered as on-campus options, leaving fewer living options for upperclassmen. Upper-division students look forward to living on campus in the coming semesters, but they are disheartened by ASU Housing s responses and the lack of student support from ASU. Students are told to check back later if housing fills up. In addition, high gas prices have made this situation even more challenging for commuting students. I have a part-time job and thought it would be more convenient to live on campus, go to classes and then go to work. But now I don t think I ll be able to because all of the housing has reached maximum capacity, said Geneva Vu, a sophomore medical studies major. ASU encourages upper-division students to live in nearby buildings and find housing off-campus because on-campus housing isn t guaranteed. ASU s nearby off-campus housing is not affordable and doesn t provide the best service for students, with many residents complaining aboutcleanlinessand maintenance issues. According to a University spokesperson, ASU celebrated the opening of a new facility with living space for more than 500 students downtown and are set to open more housing buildings in 2024. However, there is still a lack of affordable housing, leaving students feeling stressed, anxious and distracted from their schoolwork. The housing system is completely disorganized, understaffed and overpriced, Hom said. Students have tried to get in touch with housing but receive vague responses like Check back in early February,Hom said. ASU is supposed to provide students with healthy living conditions and multiple housing options if they will continue accepting a high number of students. I imagine if ASU wanted to make more money, they would put more resources into housing, but I guess that ASU doesn t really care about their students, Hom said. ASU should consider its housing capacity when deciding to invest in other projects as this problem isn t likely to be solved anytime soon. Instead, it s affecting the ASU community severely leaving students frustrated. Reach the columnist atfgalanma@asu.eduand follow@fgalanmaon Twitter.

stanforddaily_2022_120,"Amid the uncertainty of our return to undergraduate in-person classes, which has already beentwice delayedfrom Jan. 3 to Jan. 24, I have begun to wonder about the viability of a long-term hybrid educational approach. If we do not receive anotherinauspicious emailfrom Provost Drell in the next two weeks, and finally get to engage with our winter quarter professors and classmates in person on the 24th, we would have already lost three of the ten weeks of the quarter to the doom of Zoom. The uncertainty of our return date, however, should not come as a surprise to most undergraduates. Many of my peers and I agree that thisOmicron-instigated delaymirrors our memories of COVID-19’s initial devastation in March 2020, as we experience frighteningly strong waves ofdéjà-vu. It has dawned on us that the rise of new strains of COVID-19 does not bode well for our academic futures. Should we learn to expect seasonal waves of COVID-19 that send our cities, schools and workplaces into full or partial lockdown? And will universities be able to ride these waves successfully or will they — as well as our educational journeys — buckle? If Stanford continues to stick to periods of online teaching amid spikes in COVID-19 cases, perhaps hybrid education with semi-in-person quarters is a form of learning we should grow accustomed to. By standardizing a hybrid approach that equally supports seasonal periods of virtual learning accompanied by pre-established periods of in-person study, I imagine Stanford’s administration might be able to strike the right balance that would grant all students a holistic college experience. In my view, one of the most valuable aspects of this experience is sustaining meaningful relationships with each other and with our professors. With sufficient notice and time for planning, faculty members could structure course formats ahead of time to maximize peer-to-peer engagement while equipping students with timely information necessary to make informed choices, for instance, about which classes would make the most sense for them to take in person versus online. To understand how current students are grappling with this possibility, I interviewed a diverse cohort of freshmen. Ishita Gupta ’25 argues that using online education to moderate waves of COVID-19 is a good idea in theory, but not “sustainable for students’ mental health.” She states that beyond just giving students proper notice, the administration would need to plan, well in advance, shifts to hybrid or online learning. However, due to the likelihood that COVID-19 strains will continue to arise unpredictably, it appears nearly impossible that Stanford could provide students with sufficient warning unless, for example, scientific research precisely correlated colder weather with spikes in cases. Then, Stanford might be able to officially designate winter quarter, for example, as hybrid or fully online. Gupta goes on to suggest a “hybrid contingency plan” that she believes could be implemented in COVID-entrenched periods: Stanford must selectively move online only those classes with a size and structure that increase the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission (for example, big lecture classes , as well as those whosematerial and class dynamics can be replicated in an online format. Gupta adds that Stanford must keep those classes and activities that “absolutely need to be in-person completely in-person.” She notes that while no one wants to do a project on Zoom or take a virtual field trip, it would not necessarily detract from a student’s experience if the administration were to move online those elements of classes that are already as much or more effective in an asynchronous format. For example, departments like Computer Science and Symbolic Systems were already offering asynchronous material to students in pre-pandemic times. Looking beyond educational models, Lila Shroff ’25 feels more concerned about the lack of consistency in student residence situations if the university were to consistently transition between in-person and online formats. While she agrees that “the pandemic has forced everyone to practice flexibility,” she emphasizes that “college students are particularly vulnerable to changes in campus residential policies.” She believes the readjustment periods required when settling back at home or on campus must be accounted for, as the “constant flux of changing environments” has the potential to “impede relationships” both at school and at home. Other students that I have spoken to feel that as long as the social dynamics of the school are not heavily implicated and “human connection” is still present and possible, as Teddy Suisman ’25 notes, students could adapt to a hybrid educational model. However, Roman Scott ’25 argues that a long-term hybrid model is unsustainable because a virtual course format weakens the very quality of education offered. Scott feels confident that the disconnect between professors and students in online learning environments distracts and disengages students. Moreover, to combat the constant uncertainty that has begun to imbue our academic careers, Scott believes that Stanford must make a final decision on whether or not to “fully commit to in-person or virtual courses until COVID goes away.” But thequestion remains: Will COVID-19 really ever go away? Perhaps the answer to this question is more complicated than a simple “yes” or “no.” Recently, governments globally have been pushing towards treating COVD-19 as endemic rather than a pandemic — a viable approach as long as COVID-19 continues to mutate in an increasingly less severe direction. This, however, poses another question. While the World Health Organization has acknowledged this debate, leaderswarnagainst treating COVID-19 as endemic right now due to the“intense pressure”many regions around the world are facing. Thus, with the end of this virus not yet in sight, we must critically examine and modify our approach to education rather than waiting for external forces to ease up. While every student I spoke with offered a unique perspective on the long-term sustainability of a hybrid model, all of them agreed on one point: the need for consistency and the necessity for the administration to keep students in the loop. As Devy Weir ’25 states, the most draining element of Stanford’s current approach is “not knowing” and a lack of the ability to plan ahead, due to what appears to some as the university’s unwillingness to be forthcoming with new information. I do believe, that if necessary, a hybrid balance can be struck annually until COVID-19 becomes endemic, without jeopardizing students’ abilities to have a holistic college experience. For example, I can imagine the administration designating both autumn and spring quarters as fully in-person to allow students — particularly freshmen — a proper introduction and adjustment to on-campus life, as well as seniors to finish their final year among their peers and have an in-person graduation ceremony. If the world continues to witness spikes in COVID-19 cases in the winter months, the administration could designate winter quarter as a hybrid quarter, with large lecture classes moved online, while smaller, discussion-based courses remain in-person. Whatever plan Stanford decides to execute, it is critical that the administration heeds students’ voices while minimizing the spread of new contagious strains of COVID-19 and at the same time maximizing the potential for every undergraduate to fully experience Stanford.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_23,"For people of color (POC and other marginalized groups, representation in the media can often follow stereotypes and perpetuate harmful ideas. In a society that is increasinglyattemptingto increase representation in the media, we need to distinguish between accurate and harmful representation. POC and other marginalized groups, such as queer or disabled people, shouldn’t be used by mediacompaniesfor surface-level media representation to satisfy the public in promoting diversity and inclusivity. Thisrepresentationcan potentially cause more harm than good since it can influence the public’s perception of certain groups of people differently and negatively. Instead, the media should portray the meaningful and genuine experiences of these marginalized groups. There’s a line that needs to be drawn between proper, accurate representation versus representation that is harmful and inaccurate. Accurate representation portrays communities in a positive light, focusing on experiences that can be relatable for that community, without reducing it to something easily explainable to an audience who may not be familiar with the community. Movies like “The Farewell” and “Crazy Rich Asians” have received praise for providing an accurate representation of Asian American communities. In contrast, inaccurate representation typically focuses on stereotypes — specifically ones that the community involved has distanced themselves from. This type of representation is also surface-level, focusing on details that a typical watcher may be familiar with instead of digging deeper into the culture or community involved, and it can often have harmful effects on the community being represented. While the show “Euphoria” is widely acclaimed for its accurate portrayal of drug abuse, many fans claim the show doesn’t have enough POC representation and the representation it does have is based on stereotypes or lacks meaning. For example, the characters of McKay and Kat follow stereotypes based on their identities, with McKay being portrayed as hyper-athletic and Kat as an insecure, self-hating fat woman. To add on, both of these characters are cast aside in the second season as their storylines become diluted, showing how their representation didn’t provide anything meaningful for the communities they represented. There’s a difference between the presence of people of color and the accurate representation of them. If people of color are solely chosen to fill a quota in a movie or make a company seem diverse and inclusive but are not given real character development further than perpetuating harmful stereotypes, their “representation” is redundant and serves no meaningful purpose for the community the character is supposed to be representing. One example is the show “Riverdale,” which recently came under fire for merely including POC characters without furthering the character’s development. The merepresenceof an individual doesn’t connote representation; representation requires a deeper level of understanding of how one’s culture or experiences contributes to their identity. Media companies along with those who work in the media need to realize the difference between presence and representation. While their intentions mean well, their execution isn’t efficient and places the work disproportionately on people of color. Oftentimes, people of color are tasked with taking on diversity, equity and inclusioneffortson top of their current jobs without being adequately compensated. Promoting diversity in media companies takes time and requires a lot of learning and dedication for all workers involved, not just the people of color who are tasked with promoting it. For media companies to follow through in promoting diversity, it’s important for them to increase representation in the workplace too, such as hiring production teams and directors that share the same experiences of the communities they wish to represent more accurately. We as consumers can also push our favorite media companies, shows and movies to include more accurate representation rather than ones that are riddled with stereotypes. By avoiding media consumption from companies that don’t do it right and vocalizing our thoughts either on social media or online, consumers can rally supporters to influence media companies to make changes. It’s also valuable to support the franchises that are already doing this, especially with how rare this can be in the media industry. Representation in the media is so incredibly important for individuals to see themselves on screen; however, it should reflect their genuine experiences instead of their mere presence.

wildcat_arizona_2022_45,"An illustration of a person enjoying fall in the desert by Nettie Gastelum. Even though it might not feel like fall in Tucson, it’s here! Fall is my favorite season because I love the food, colors and weather. I love lighting a candle, having a chai latte and watching scary movies. The vibes are spectacular, and I wanted to share some of my favorite media to put me in the fall spirit. Red (Taylor’s Version – Taylor Swift The second re-recording done by Taylor Swift is one of my favorite albums of all time. This 30-song album has all the hits from her original 2012Redera, with the addition of nine bonus tracks and the 10-minute version of “All Too Well.” This album is filled with autumn references like the line, “Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,” from “All Too Well.” This album is one of my go-tos regarding lyrics and fall vibes. Rumours– Fleetwood Mac This 11-song album is full of breakup songs that have lots of angst. This album not only follows a breakup, but it is also about the heavy drug use of the band. The album was released in 1977 and made Fleetwood Mac a household name, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time and one of the best-selling albums of2022. This album reminds me of changing seasons and taking car trips to see the trees alter their colors. Hozier– Hozier Hozier knows how to write hauntingly beautiful songs, which is evident from his 2014 debut album. His dark lyrics, combined with the upbeat melodies, make this album perfect for a fall listen. His voice is soothing even when he is singing about death, which he frequently does in this album. This album reminds me of rainy, cool days driving to school. “Gilmore Girls” “Gilmore Girls” radiates warmth and is one of my comfort shows. I rewatch this show every fall, because it signifies the start of a new school year. The story follows Rory and Lorelai Gilmore as Rory goes through high school and college. This show is about nothing and everything at the same time. I think people rewatch it because the storyline is still prevalent today, even though it was released 20 years ago. “Gilmore Girls” is available to stream on Netflix. “Only Murders in the Building” “Only Murders in the Building” is one of my new favorite shows. I grew up with Selena Gomez and wanted to watch her in something other than what was offered on Disney Channel, and this show delivered. “Only Murders in the Building” is a mixture of Agatha Christie novels and true crime podcasts, and has something for everyone. It is hilarious and heartwarming, and with the murder aspect, it is a perfect show for Halloween and fall. “Only Murders in the Building” is available to stream on Hulu. “What’s New, Scooby-Doo?” “What’s New, Scooby-Doo?” was my favorite show growing up, and now I watch it every Halloween. It is a kid-friendly show, but I still enjoy it. The episodes are short, and it is a show you can put on while doing chores. Each episode follows the Scooby Gang solving mysteries. “What’s New, Scooby-Doo?” is available to stream on HBO Max. RELATED:OPINION: Students should not stand for white supremacy “Matilda” “Matilda” was my favorite movie as a kid, and it brought me so much joy and comfort, then and now. The film follows a girl with psychic powers trying to fit in with her rude family, and she learns to read to escape real life. This is one movie that I will never get tired of watching, especially during the fall. It radiates comfort, and the school setting makes it feel like a fall movie. “Matilda” is available to stream on STARZ. “Knives Out” “Knives Out” is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever watched. It is about a mystery writer who dies, and his family members are all suspects. The cast is star-studded with people like Chris Evans and Jamie Lee Curtis. The director knows how to capture and keep the audience on their toes as he creates plot twists that nobody sees coming. This movie is the perfect mystery to watch during the fall. “Knives Out” is available to rent or purchase on Amazon Prime Video. “Pride and Prejudice” “Pride and Prejudice” is one of my favorite period pieces, both thebookand the 2005 film. The film captures the Jane Austen book’s drama and romance, while adding a beautiful musical score. It also has thehand scene, which is one of the most distinguishable scenes in romance movies. “Pride and Prejudice” is available to stream on Peacock. “A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder” – Holly Jackson “A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder” follows Pip, who tries to prove Sal Singh did not murder Andie Bell five years ago for an end-of-year project. It had me on the edge of my seat and was fast-paced. This book was one of my fastest reads and one of my five-star reads last year, and its two sequels are just as good. “The Guest List” – Lucy Foley “The Guest List” was the book that got me back into reading last year. The story follows a wedding, where one person ends up dead. It has multiple points of view and several plot twists, making it a book I could not put down. It is one of the best thrillers I have read. “Little Women” – Louisa May Alcott “Little Women” follows the four March sisters – Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy – as they try to navigate childhood and womanhood. The characters are warm people and will do anything to help others. It reminds me of simpler times, without the distraction of technology, and focuses on the importance of family.

crimson_2022_94,"I have a confession to make: I took Latin in high school. Revealing this part of my past is always a gamble within Harvard’s gates — some are captivated by my choice, others frankly baffled — but I hold tight to it. Latin and I go back; admittedly, only a fraction of the language’snearly 3,000-year-oldexistence, but we’ve had each other since the dramatically-humbling experience of seventh grade, which, by all accounts, gave the actual Dark Ages a run for their money. And of course, I must affirm that Latin is, indeed, dead. I hardly equivocate about befriending (or, perhaps, being haunted by the ghost of a language. But Latin’s very death was precisely what mesmerized me about it: The language was inextricable from its history, and I was fascinated by what the ancient nooks and crannies of Latin literature could reveal to me about the collapse of its almighty civilization. I dedicated five years of my life to that history, to the firm prose of Cicero and the lush poetry of Vergil that, in all of their antiquity, seemed to resurrect an entire people from their grave. But while I had been so diligently dusting the tombstone of one dead language, I hadn’t realized that, at the very same time, I had been sealing the grave of my own people’s mother tongue right behind me — that breathing life into Latin meant that I had been suffocating Kashmiri, the language of my ancestors. Unlike with Latin, I cannot defend my proficiency in Kashmiri: I do not know Kashmiri, and I never have. My parents are both fluent speakers of the language, which isguttural yet melodic, nurtured by its Persian, Punjabi, Sanskrit, and Dardic ancestors but hardened by Kashmir’s own distincthistoryof colonialism; still, my sister and I failed to absorb even a crumb of our linguistic heritage. This failure torments my family. My parents, my sister, and I collectively bear the guilt of complicity in Kashmiri’s impending extinction within our own family tree. And for a language attributed to onlyseven millionnative speakers, what does the vanishing of one lineage of Kashmiri mean? As settler-colonial politics continue to dictate the pulse of Kashmir, themost militarizedarea on Earth, in whose hands does the future of Kashmiri rest if not those of Kashmiri families like my own? That my neglect of Kashmiri for Latin proved so fatal is endemic to an academic landscape — from primary to professional education — where lack of representation is malignant. And when this lack presents in an institution as commanding as Harvard, it metastasizes, reproducing feelings of invisibility and insignificance that have characterized the experience of students from marginalized groups for generations. Indeed, before course enrollment each semester, my eyes glitter in shameless hope for what I might find about my motherland; yet, time after time, my Crimson Cart consistently locates little to no returns on the search terms, “Kashmir,” “Kashmiri,” or any permutation of my identity for which I would beg to see made visible in this institution. Remarkably, this year, introductory, intermediate, and advanced instruction in Kashmiri are supervised (but not taught through Harvard’s South Asian Studies Department, albeit for the first time in years and “according to the academic needs of students,” rather than pure intellectual curiosity. On the other hand, of the four courses I’ve managed to excavate from years of course offerings that, even for one unit, center Kashmiri culture, only one is offered this entire academic year. Even so, its narrow focus on Kashmiri Brahmins largely obscures the contributions and traditions of lower-caste and Muslim Kashmiris, satisfying the very same impulse for invisibility that is so often embedded into the structures of courses at Harvard. I’d like to think, though, that universities, especially Harvard, share the responsibility to keep my people’s history alive. In many ways, Harvard is an arbiter of belonging; it sculptsnational prioritiesand, in the process, shapes what and who matters (or doesn’t as the world watches. To forget is political, but for Harvard to consciously remember Kashmir — to engrave my people into the memory of this institution — would be an even more profoundly political move, an act of resistance against an international architecture bent on forgetting and disenfranchising Kashmiri experiences. Ultimately, for the people of Kashmir and other communities whose lives exist largely on fault lines, a helping hand from Harvard would be intensely symbolic. It would ensure that, as scholars, we can approach the diversity this world has to offer not as archaeologists disentombing a long-gone past, but as individuals committed to protecting and cherishing the still-beating heart of our world today. Harvard will, of course, not save Kashmir — I never expected it to do so. But its support could very well immortalize Kashmir as a place, a history, and a people worth saving. Here, then, lies the future of Kashmir within Harvard’s walls: an opportunity not just for mere representation of Kashmir at this University, but for an intentional, proud celebration of Kashmiri history and language. And I pray to see the same kind of belonging for the traditions of other underrepresented communities on campus — otherwise, I fear too many other students may not be able to save their cultures from their deathbeds before it’s too late.

stanforddaily_2022_50,"Strive for the extraordinary. This was the topic of my college admissions essays and the mentality that took me on a trans-Atlantic journey to study in the United States. As a 12-year-old schoolgirl I was asked where I dreamed of attending university, and I shyly replied with the name of the nearest big city to my hometown in England. The smiling adult was suitably impressed, but I remember thinking to myself — imagine their response if they knew the truth. I want to attend university in California. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when or where the dream started, but this was the moment when I decided for myself to turn this dream into a plan. I was probably inspired in the early days by “High School Musical” or some other Disney Channel fantasy filled with cheerleaders, dancing on the tables during lunch break, and teenagers wearing theirown clothesinstead of a school uniform. But on reflection, there was something more about California that called out to me. I pictured a way of life where my disability would cease to be a barrier due to the warmer climate and relative accessibility of the environment compared to the ancient architecture of the U.K. I fantasized about rolling along smooth, wide boulevards in my powered wheelchair and basking in the independence that a college campus would afford me. I was enchanted by the idea of being different for some reason other than my disability, relishing in the prospect of small talk about my accent and growing up in a quaint British town. As I felt increasingly isolated from my school friends because of my physical limitations, I longed for a taste of acceptance and believed America held the answer. I thrive on having a goal and I knew what I had to do to put my plans into action. Learning was something I excelled at and getting good grades was the only option. My anxieties about fitting in among my peers faded because I had my sights set somewhere beyond high school, and I accepted not being able to go out and socialize in the same way as everyone else because I was using that time to get where I wanted more than anything to be. As I developed the confidence to share my ambitions, I learned that it’s okay for people not to believe in you. In part, their laughter at my plans energized me because I knew that I was about to prove them all wrong. At the precise moment my parents were told I would not survive beyond the age of six, my life became all about defying the odds. One by one, I worked through the list of components that would make studying abroad possible: academic achievement, impressive extracurriculars, generous financial aid, access to robust healthcare, complex travel logistics for my powered wheelchair, funding for 24/7 caregivers to enable me to pursue an education outside of my home country … the list goes on. I had never spent more than a weekend away from my parents, so the greatest hurdle of all was trusting each other that I could do this independently. The desire to prove myself was ingrained in me from an early age, in part as a character trait and in part as a manifestation of my internalized ableism. For my life to have value, nothing I ever did could be mediocre. Studying in the U.S. was the ultimate symbol of overcoming my disability, and the fact that I got into Stanford was the icing on the cake. *** With graduation only a few days away, I can confidently say that my time at Stanford has been extraordinary. But as is often the case, it has been so in the most unexpected of ways. Academically, not only have I majored in a field that I never once considered prior to my sophomore year, but I have grown in my appreciation of knowledge for knowledge’s sake rather than focusing on education as primarily a means to an end. I gradually learned that fulfillment would come from enrolling in classes that I actually wanted to take — not those I felt I ought to — and I ultimately carved out a learning experience that has been truly authentic to my passions. Most unexpectedly of all, I found myself in Oxford courtesy of BOSP and the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was there that I first began to believe in myself as a real scholar, discovering an academic niche that went on to shape the latter half of my Stanford experience. As for the people I have been lucky enough to meet along the way, I would have to agree with the majority of students when they say that the people here are the best thing about Stanford. I arrived as a freshman craving social connection, but quickly realized that forming relationships was an evolving process that required me to step out of my comfort zone and tap into a vulnerability that I had been so averse to all my life. It wasn’t just going to happen for me —even in America. Despite this yearning for social bonds, I spent years convincing myself that I would be fine either way because I had goals that I was intent on achieving, but I now recognize wholeheartedly that when everything else is falling apart, my social ties and points of meaningful connection are what keep me afloat. I have found friendships that teach me new things about myself every day, and I am eternally grateful for their acceptance of me in all my strength and fragility. They have shown me that I bring value as a friend too, helping me drown out the voice that — echoed by a society that sees people with disabilities as disabled first and human only second — insists otherwise. Finally, I came to Stanford seeking an escape from my disabled self, but in reality I have experienced the exact opposite. In some ways the everyday challenges of college life have brought my disability into sharper focus than ever before, and in certain moments I have found myself just longing for the ability to walk so that I would not have to spend another day facing institutional inaccessibility and — you guessed it — a lack of wheelchair accessible transport. What these moments have shown me, however, is that I can be more honest with myself about my experience with disability, and I hope that my writing today is a testament to that. Finding connection and belonging in the disability community at Stanford has encouraged me not to run from but to embrace this part of my identity, and I have learned to use advocacy for myself and others as a source of power. Despite my best intentions, Stanford has helped me grow into my disability, but I will leave this campus as a more complete version of myself because of it. *** Graduation has come around far too quickly, and I have never been good at saying goodbye. I could write a book about the incredible experiences and opportunities that have defined my Stanford experience in so many unique and wonderful ways, but that’s not what this column is about. At The Daily, writing about disability has been my ‘thing,’ so, as a final farewell, I wanted to write candidly about how I have experienced Stanford — from beginning to end — through the lens of my disability. It certainly wasn’t perfect, but looking back I hardly recognize my freshman self for all the best reasons. The page has turned and the next chapter is dawning — onto sunny LA because this Cali girl isn’t going anywhere! — but as I leave this campus behind for now, I am most grateful to Stanford for showing me the true meaning ofextraordinary.

crimson_2022_129,"“In every generation, they rise against us to destroy us,” Jewish students sang in the Vehi SheAmda prayer at Friday and Saturday night’s Passover seders. The passage first appeared in thePassover liturgy in the 8th century, and it still rings true. They did and still do rise against us. They rose against us to destroy us during years of our people’s enslavement and backbreaking labor in Egypt, which we commemorate and relive during the Passover seder. They rose against us during centuries of inquisitions, expulsions, pogroms, and blood libels. Passover, in particular, was a time of fear for Jews throughout Medieval times. During this holiday time, gentiles raised baseless accusations against Jews, claiming that they murdered gentile children and used their blood for Passover rituals. These accusations exploded on an annual basis into pogroms, murder sprees that kept Jews reciting, millennia after their Exodus, “This year we are slaves, next year we will be free people.” American Jews continue to face the seemingly eternal virus of antisemitism. In 2021, onein four Jews experienced antisemitismand there was a12 percent increasein antisemitic acts such as vandalism, harassment, and assault. This Passover, our campus has witnessed antisemitism and callous disregard of Jewish students. As students observing Passover returned from joyous celebrations, they were disturbed to enter Harvard Yard and see a large display resembling Holocaust imagery of planes, barbed wire fences, and boxcars, including bandying insults against Zionists, equating their belief in a homeland for the Jewish people with systematic oppressions as stark as racism and homophobia. Passover tells the history of the Jewish people bravely uniting to break from the oppressive bonds of slavery. To host Israel Apartheid Week during Passover diminishes the experience of Jewish suffering and cries for Jewish safety because Israel Apartheid Week opposes the existence of the State of Israel and claims that Jewish people are racist oppressors. By inviting known Holocaust denial apologist, Norman Finkelstein to campus, the Palestinian Solidarity Committee created a hostile environment for Jewish students. Finklestein is the author of ‘The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering.” This bookevokesthe antisemitic stereotype that Jews are greedy, manipulative, and power-hungry, by implying that Jews benefit financially from the Third Reich’s genocide of the Jewish people. Beyond that, Finkelstein has praised Holocaust denier David Irving, and terrorist groups such as Hezbollah. The Apartheid wall, prominently featured on campus, declares that “Zionism is racism, settler colonialism, white supremacy, apartheid.” It includes graphics triggering for many Jewish students, cartoon depictions of a wired fence, World War II-style airplanes, and boxcar trains — images that call to mind a Nazi concentration camp. Additionally, when the great majority of Jews in Israel are Sephardi, Mizrachi, African, or of mixed Ethnicity, whitewashing Zionism as “white supremacy” is also inherently antisemitic. The Anti-Defamation League defines Zionism as the Jewish movement for self-determination in the land of Israel — the historical birthplace and biblical homeland of the Jewish people. With this in mind, Zionism, manifested as the desire to return to the Land of Israel, has been at the heart of Judaism since the Jewish peoples were forced, oppressed, and exiled from their ethnic homeland two thousand years ago. Such Zionism is embedded in Jewish prayer, ritual, literature, and culture, and in turn, Pew Research Centerreportsthat 45 percent of Jews say caring about Israel is “essential” to their Jewish identity, and an additional 37 percent say it is “important” to their Jewish identity. When the overwhelming majority of Jewish people identify as Zionist, to dismiss this ideology is culturally and historically insensitive and antisemitic. Jewish individuals have been active participants in civil rights, gender equality, fair labor, and queer liberation movements all throughout American history. Jewish students work to promote the ideal of Tzelem Elohim, that all people have a divine spark in them and have equal dignity and value, and Tikkun Olam, world repair. To label a significant portion of Jewish students racist and colonial for following their religious values is antisemitic and disheartening. Witnessing how people rise against Jewish communities in this generation has been a burden for many Jewish students, but they will remember the first verse of the Vehi Sheamda prayer: “It is this that has stood for our ancestors and for us,” this meaning the promise that God made to Abraham, that our ancestors would be redeemed from Egypt and make it safely to the biblical Land of Israel. It is this promise of a national homeland that we proudly sing at the end of the seder, “Next Year in Jerusalem.” — Rebecca S.

Every year on Feb. 14, single people nationwide mourn their single-ness by having sad single drinks at sad single bars with other sad single people, just waiting for the next day when all the crappy milk chocolate streaked through with a mysterious stripe of pink go on sale at the grocery store. Conversely, couples that have been together for years and couples that have just started dating two weeks ago alike lose hair to the stressing over the perfect Valentine’s Day date. They agonize over every detail — the roses, the reservations and the romance of it all, building up their anticipation of an event that can never live up to expectations. As someone with quite a few Valentine’s Days under my belt, spent both single and in relationships of various stages, let me tell you: it is just not that serious. Don’t get me wrong — dedicating a day to celebrate those that you love is important! However, it’s not worth all the stress that gets put into it. RELATED:OPINION:Let’s talk about love bombing According toFortunly, Americans spent about $20.7 billion on Valentine’s Day last year, and more than 135 million Americans went shopping for Valentine’s Day in that same year. We are spending astronomical amounts of money to create a day that almost never meets expectations anyway. Think about a time you realized you loved someone, whether it was your best friend or your partner. Likely, it was something about them that made you love them, not some grand gesture. Valentine’s Day shouldn’t be about making elaborate plans. It should be about buying someone their favorite flowers because you remembered them talking about how much they loved yellow roses or taking your date to your favorite fancy restaurant for dinner because you both love an excuse to dress up. Even if you’re single, there’s still so much to celebrate! I guarantee there are people around you who you love, and the creation of Galentine’s Day means that you can dress up in your favorite mini skirts (or sweatshirts and absolutely gorge yourself on strawberries and champagne with your friends with absolutely no judgment.

ubyssey_2022_34,"March 19, 2022 Written byDaphnée Lévesque So, let’s talk about motivation. Personally, it’s hard for me to motivate myself, especially during the winter. It’s even harder to reward myself when Idoengage in healthy behaviours, because I have the belief that I did not “accomplish” enough to reward myself. So, I had to come up with creative ways to take care of myself! When I’m feeling depressed and get home at the end of a long day, the last thing I want to do is undress and hop in the shower. It takes too much effort. But I love LUSH, and I love smelling and feeling good. I invested in some LUSH products to motivate myself to shower. In fact, I’d be more than happy to take multiple showers a day if my collection of products would refill itself without having to spend so much money! Another task I hate doing. Who likes to brush their teeth? Not me. However, I came up with the idea of buying toothpaste with flavours other than mint! It’s made a huge difference, honestly. Who doesn’t like to brush their teeth with mango, strawberry or blueberry toothpaste! Ah, yes. I avoid doing my dishes until they pile up in the sink (thank God for understanding roommates . However, I recently invested in nice-smelling dish soap. Sage Wellness sells dish soap called “Dish Wish” and I will never buy another bottle of Dawn soap! In my eyes, it’s totally worth it because it’s made doing the dishes more enjoyable. I never enjoyed doing laundry until I invested in quality bamboo bed sheets. They were somewhat expensive, but they make my sleep experience a hundred times better, so that’s worth it to me. Owning nice bedsheets motivates me to do my laundry (and make my bed because nothing beats the feeling of slipping under the covers after a long day, and landing on an ultra-soft sheet that will feel amazing against your skin. And now, let’s talk about… rewards! There are a million ways to treat yourself, so what works for me might not work for you. I thought I’d share some of the ways I try to reward myself, to give you some inspiration, or at least get you to reflect on finding ways to reward yourself! I love to go out to eat with my friends, so once in a while, we’ll pick a more expensive restaurant and splurge on our favourite foods. The perfect time to do this is before and after midterm season. Both motivation and reward within the same time frame! I know that the stereotypes about girls loving to buy clothes, but anyone from any gender can enjoy getting new clothing. If you want to reward yourself, you can buy yourself something that you really want, or even give yourself permission to spend an entire day at the shopping mall (shopping can be extremely therapeutic, as you can imagine . Paintballing? Escape rooms? Laser tag? Go karts? Sometimes I reward myself by scheduling a fun, new and unusual activity. You can invite your friends and have a fun afternoon together. Celebrate the end of the school year! Take advantage of reading break and distract yourself from a mountain of school work! That includes bubble baths, hot chocolate, a walk outside, seeing my loved ones, cuddling with my stuffed animals and going to the spa! If you’re a busy student and want to reward yourself, unplug for a day and do all the things that make you feel good! Motivation and reward are two closely-related concepts, and it’s definitely worth it to explore both sides of the coin. The authors of this column are not mental health professionals.

I know I’ve been guilty of it. In my experience, complaining sometimes becomes an easy bonding opportunity amongst students: lulls in the conversation are frequently filled with hyperbolic jokes about food at North being inedible or about dorms the size of shoeboxes. I don’t want to dismiss the legitimate difficulties that students with dietary restrictions or accessibility needs face at Rice. However, the majority of complaints I hear seem to come from students who expect luxury but overlook the employees who work so hard to provide for our every need. Rice’s campus staff is incredible and I urge us all to show them more respect and gratitude. Rice’sHousingandDiningandFacilities Engineering and Planningdepartments create a quality of life that most college students would envy. The serveries have fruits and vegetables at every meal and always offer a variety of options; the food is ready at our convenience and we never need to wash or bus our own dishes; our college commons are cleaned several times a day. When we accidentally leave trash lying around, H&D employees pick up after us. The lush grass, cozy study spots and4300 trees across campusare painstakingly maintained without any effort on our part. In addition to habitual complaining, another pattern I’ve seen is the tendency to simply ignore Rice’s custodial employees. When we get caught up in our busy schedules, we tend to look right past the people washing our classroom windows, serving our food, constructing our new buildings and tending to our green spaces. In doing so, we treat them as a means to an end rather than with humanity. We can do better. More importantly, H&D and FE&P employees deserve better. Hours before we wake up just in time for our first class, they’re hard at work preparing breakfast and cleaning bathrooms. They exemplify dedication and consistency year-round, keeping Rice running while we enjoy summer and academic breaks. These staff are an integral part of our Rice community and a key reason why the Rice experience is such an incredible one. Last month, the $15-per-hour minimum wage that former President DavidLeebron announced last Novemberwent into effect. I was naïvely surprised to learn that, prior to July 1, many employees in custodial, food service and groundskeeping received the previous minimum wage of $11.50 per hour. Learning this figure was a much-needed reminder that some of the most dedicated and hardworking staff on Rice campus are often underappreciated. I urge everyone to show a little extra kindness towards campus staff. If you have the financial means, donating to your college’s annual H&D Appreciation Fund is an effective way to materially support H&D staff. Small gestures of warmth and appreciation are important too: asking the dining staff about their weekends when they swipe you into the servery, thanking the groundskeepers in the Academic Quad and saying hi to the custodians who keep your college commons clean. Lastly, we need to respect the work of Rice’s groundskeepers by avoiding taking shortcuts that destroy grass and plants. As we return to our beautiful campus this month and remember just how lucky we are to be at Rice, I hope we can be more intentional about showing gratitude for our campus staff members. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25.

stanforddaily_2022_70,"Najman Mahbouba is currently a student at Los Gatos High School. He has worked on numerous public policy related projects at Harvard, UC Santana Barbara and San Jose State University. Research suggests that the immaturity “gap” between adults and juveniles is greatest at the age of 16 or 17. This means that 16 and 17-year-olds are more likely to make risky decisions because of social and emotional factors that are less present in younger juveniles. Currently, judges deliver the harshest sentences to juvenile offenders in this age range, even though neuroscientific research suggests that juveniles who offend during this period of their life often no longer represent a risk after they pass this agerange. Since teenagers are most likely to offend at this age due to a peak in brain immaturity, as opposed to greater inherent risk, judges should not deliver comparatively longer sentences to these juveniles. This specific issue reveals a much larger problem in policy making: the lack of consideration for evidence-based neuroscience research when implementing public policies. Many neuroscientific findings show promising potential to improve public policy. For example, how muchplasticity is present in children with attention deficit disorderat different ages, and how should educational policy be designed to promote their learning and well-being? How should youth sports, especially tackle football, be altered as a result of research showing thelong-term negative effectsof repeated concussions in the development of disorders such as degenerative brain condition and chronic traumatic encephalopathy? How should we change solitary confinement legislation after research illustrates its tendency to cause serious mental health problems in someindividuals? And howaccurate is eyewitness testimony? Do environmental and biological factors change the validity of eyewitness testimony? If yes, how should we take those factors into consideration when presenting eyewitness testimonies to judges and juries? The examples I just listed are only a few of the hundreds of policies that neuroscience can inform. The possibilities are vast and pertinent, but we are not taking full advantage of them due to a lack of communication and collaboration. Furthermore, while a myriad of reasons account for this divide, and these reasons often vary between areas, research institutions and individual government structures, two interconnected causes have been identified as almost universal. A lack of pre-existing accessible systems to translate research to policymakers, and a surfeit of information penetrating legislative offices — with much of it being unreliable and irrelevant. On the first point, translating “up” can be intimidating. Moving a scientific finding from the lab to the academic medical center is difficult enough. Public policy, in addition, is a vastly different realm than scientific research, with markedly different goals, incentives, systems and structures. Understanding these differences can help us identify why a considerable amount of policy translation endeavors fail and how we must develop a different approach. On the second point, policymakers have a difficult time finding accurate and relevant information. Keith Humphreys, an American psychologist and Stanford University professor who worked in the White House,statedthat “the challenge for policymakers parallels that of a person who enters ‘What is a good way to lose weight?’ into an internet search engine: a surfeit of conflicting recommendations — most of them claiming scientific warrant — and no reliable way to separate the gold from the dross.” Policymakers respond to this situation in the same way that many of us deal with overload and a lack of understanding of other institutions. They limit their attention to a group of known sources they consider credible. Translating neuroscience into policy requires neuroscientists to be in that loop of credible sources, but right now they are largely not, especially at the state, county and city levels, as a number ofstudiesin the past havedetermined. Thus, as a solution, I am proposing the creation of a neuroscience and public policy social network; one similar to “SNAP,” the Stanford Addiction and Public Policy network. SNAP is a network for policymakers to connect with pharmaceutical scientists on drug addiction-related matters. On SNAP, policymakers are polled on which drug addiction issues they consider most crucial. According to the results of the poll, Stanford scientists connect with the policymakers about the most urgent issues, providing them with pertinent data, past work that provides insight into possible conflicts and relevant research ideas being explored. Most policymakers and neuroscientists deeply care about creating better public policies and are willing to work together on important issues. Unfortunately, the network is just not there yet, evident by the lack of aforementioned translation. This is where a neuroscience X public policy communication network will be instrumental. Neuroscience can offer insight into numerous societal concerns, in some instances extending to policy design and implementation, from improved justice systems to public health and school reform. Additionally, neuroscience can help predict the likely outcomes of particular policy actions and then evaluates those outcomes, intended and unintended, wanted and unwanted. While legislation will never be completely impartial, nor should it necessarily be, it can still benefit from neuroscientific guidance. A statement that exemplifies why we should focus on effectively bridging gaps between academic neuroscience research and policy making, in the pursuit of better legislation for all.

ubyssey_2022_43,"Jan. 13, 2022 Written byJulianna Yue Every year when Halloween rolls around, the BIPOC population and I fear seeing our respective cultures worn as costumes. Outside of this annual occurrence, costume parties and trends cause arguments: is it appropriation or appreciation? Recently I visited the dollar store in University Village with a friend, and I came across a costume in the toy aisle. I was just looking at the various knickknacks when I came across ‘Native American” costume accessories. I was beyond offended, seeing items such as the “Native American Choker” and “Native American Peace Pipe.” The items in question came fromForum Novelties Inc, a store featuring a variety of costumes and party supplies. Many such costumes appropriate different cultures, from “Asian Style and Ninja,” to “Desert Prince & Princess,” to “Egyptian,” to “Native American” and many more. Why is cultural appropriation so hard for folks to understand? There’s a thin line between appreciation and appropriation, yet celebrity and influencer figures tend to overstep these bounds in an attempt to gain more popularity or follow the latest trend. Recently this has included non-Black celebrities donning traditional hairstyles, and ‘the sexy fox eye look’ which fetishizes Asian eyes. Appropriation is the inappropriate adoption of cultural elements and identity by folks not belonging to that culture or identity. This allows people to take the ‘good’ aspects of a culture to use for personal interest. Many times, this disproportionately affects minority cultures. Cultural appreciation, on the other hand, seeks to understand cultures outside of one’s own. It reaches beyond personal uses and seeks to broaden individual perspectives. This also acts to connect different cultures. Seeing this in action on campus, in a store that I’ve shopped at multiple times, was jarring. Seeing my culture exploited and produced for economic gain made me angry, once again making me question why people think it’s okay to dress up as a race or culture. This practice is indicative of a wider pattern of casual racist ignorance, and it must be made clear that this is unacceptable. Is it really that difficult to choose a costume without offending anyone? Perhaps wear a banana costume or a cow onesie to your next costume party – but please, please, please – keep that ‘Native’, ‘Asian’, or any other race-based costume at home.

wildcat_arizona_2022_65,"BeReal seems to be the latest Gen Z obsession, and I’m hopping on the bandwagon. The app sends out a notification to all users at a random time of each day. At that time, you have two minutes to post. The camera takes a photo of both front and back camera, so people see what you look like and where you are. There’s no time to manicure the perfect selfie, or do something interesting. It’s a glimpse into your friend’s lives, unedited. You can post late, but it does tell your friends that you posted later than the BeReal time of the day. BeReal has all the best parts of Snapchat and Instagram, without many of the toxic aspects of social media. Like Snapchat stories, BeReal only lasts for the day, so your friends can only see your BeReal for the day it’s posted. BeReal also has a “memories” feature, like Snapchat. You can see your own old BeReals, but nobody else can. I like this feature because it gives you a little personal timeline of moments out of each day. The app uses the best parts of Instagram in the sense that you can see what your friends are up to and interact with their posts. BeReal has a comment section and a “RealMoji” feature where you can react to their post with a little selfie. BeReal takes out the toxicity from social media in the sense that what you post isn’t a curated, manicured and edited highlight reel of your life. It brings a refreshing level of authenticity to social media. The app as a whole disencourages retaking pictures or deleting anything. It showcases your friends just being human. It is also one of those apps that I don’t feel is a waste of time. It isn’t addicting, and I don’t feel worse about myself after using it. BeReal is the refreshing take on social media young people were craving. During the pandemic, everything was online and realness was needed, not some polished existence. BeReal is breaking down social media standards by preventing users from putting a filter on everything or sorting through a collection of a million selfies in order to post only the best one. This should be the social media of the future. It is a much more mentally beneficial way to stay connected with your friends, without comparing your life to just carefully selected highlights of their life. It’s by far the healthiest social media I have ever been on. I hope that everyone will eventually hop onto the BeReal bandwagon.

stanforddaily_2022_100,"Browsing through the list of Introductory Seminars offered for Spring Quarter, clicking on one only to find that “This course is expected to experience high student demand,” hunting down memory lane for details to declare love for a particular subject … such is the rite of passage of frosh and sophomores — gambling in the IntroSem game. Legend has it that Stanford IntroSems are modeled afterMIT Undergraduate Seminars, electives offering hands-on learning for subjects such as astronomy and nuclear fusion and graded with a simple pass/fail. Providing small-group settings for students to engage in seminar-style discussions with professors that are leading experts in their fields, IntroSems are some of the most sought-after courses at Stanford, whether for their moderate workload, easy fulfillment of General Education Requirements or niche subject matter. Every year, frosh and sophomores make their bids on their top three choices, ordering them strategically and pouring their hearts out on the application, praying that one or two of their ideas catch the professors’ eyes. “This is the college application process all over again,” remarked those around me. Stanford advertises IntroSems as being “equally valuable both as a place to experiment with something entirely new and to build on existing knowledge.” However, this principle of accessibility often contradicts the competitive nature of some offerings that receiveas many as 300 applications. To be able to stand out as the lucky “winner” often requires us to have prior knowledge on the subject and be able to write a nuanced application essay. Unable to come up with a better explanation of my interest other than “I am fascinated by the scientifically accurate details ofInterstellarplanets,” I crossed “Designing Science Fiction Planets” off of my “considering” list despite its promise to fulfill the Ways – Scientific Method and Analysis requirement for a humanities major. The way that the current IntroSem application process favors those with prior experience in the subject conflicts with the curriculum of the courses, which are “designed to be accessible to first-year students regardless of prior high-school background.” Therefore, walking into class expecting for their previous conception of Regency-era literature to be revolutionized by in-depth discussions, prospective English majors in “Jane Austen’s Fiction” might find themselves rereading the same novels and engaging in conversations that do not go beyond a plot summary and historical context. Students often face the choice of selecting between a seminar on a subject matter they are curious about versus one aligned with their previous studies, which may be easier to get in yet limits their scope of exploration. Granted, students often make fascinating new discoveries when delving into a previously studied topic under the guidance of knowledgeable professors and when hearing new perspectives from diverse peers. Taking “Theatrical Wonders from Shakespeare to Mozart” last quarter, I greatly enjoyed analyzing film and ballet adaptations of the Shakespearean plays I had previously read. I was also grateful to have gotten to know a leading Renaissance scholar, Professor Blair Hoxby, whose research interests aligned with my then-intended English major. Regardless, the IntroSem application system and course curriculum inadequately address the needs of both those seeking to take a first dive and those desiring more intellectual challenge in a particular subject. To do so, Stanford should consider separating seminar offerings into those that cater to beginners and those designed for students with previous exposure to the field. The latter would be able to move beyond discussions about basic information yet still remain distinct from advanced seminars in their relatively low demand on analytical skills. Professors should note their preferences for the knowledge background of their students on their course pages instead of simply using the official blanket statement, “IntroSems rarely have prerequisites, except curiosity and an open mind.” With their courses more narrowly tailored to specific student needs, professors will have more direction when selecting desired students for their seminars, which in turn will contribute to admitted students having a more equal voice in class discussions. Additionally, Stanford should create more opportunities for students to participate in the more competitive IntroSems. The existing label of high-demand courses helps students set expectations for their chances of admission but often bars those with limited experience and less to present in their essays from applying. Opening multiple sessions for offerings such as “Things About Stuff” throughout the year could introduce the field of electrical engineering to more students through accessible discussions about its application in life around them. To achieve this may mean recruiting more professors to teach the same seminar, each having their own different specializations and teaching styles. While the current IntroSem system still offers rich opportunities, such as lively discussions and valuable friendships, it will remain far from achieving its full potential until Stanford reforms the system to cater to students’ specific needs.

stanforddaily_2022_27,"The recent launch of the Doerr School of Sustainability is an historic accomplishment. Long the global leader among universities in energy technology and entrepreneurship more generally, including in renewable energy technology and climate tech ventures more specifically, Stanford has a powerful opportunity to establish itself as the global leader in sustainability. One especially promising avenue to build off the momentum from the new school would be to launch a sustainability entrepreneurship law program at the law school. Peer law schools all have entrepreneurship law clinics and programs where students can gain experience offering transactional legal help to entrepreneurs in areas such as incorporation, fundraising, business contracts, intellectual property licensing, employment matters and regulatory challenges: Stanford Law School’s Mills Legal Clinic, which provides legal help to indigent individuals and nonprofits, offers law students some of the world’s best in clinical legal experiential education, and its success is to be celebrated. Stanford was the first law school to launch aSupreme Court Litigation Clinic. The law school’sOrganizations and Transactions Law Clinicprovides students with deeply rewarding work serving some of the country’s most well-renowned nonprofits while itsJuelsgaard Intellectual Property and Innovation Clinicallows participating students incredible opportunities to work on the cutting edge of legal and policy issues affecting innovation and intellectual property matters. However, these clinical offerings do not include business legal assistance for impact-focused or low-income entrepreneurs that peer law school clinical programs provide. More could be done at the law school to build program offerings for students to gain experience offering on-the-ground business legal advice to help entrepreneurs grow their sustainability-focused startups. By choosing to fully engage in building such program offerings, the law school could catch up with and even exceed those of peer law schools. Stanford Law School also offers courses supporting general startup education, including aVenture Capitalclass, which provides students the chance to learn about the venture capital ecosystem from a theoretical and practical perspective; instructors and class lecturers include both leading legal and leading investor minds in the space. Such courses, however, do not yet offer students experiential education opportunities for servicing startups, although they could provide a strong complement to new experiential education opportunities, were the law school to choose to offer them. Stanford Law School has previously taken small steps to begin offering its students some experiential education opportunities to service entrepreneurs. During the 2016-2017 academic school year, the policy labBusiness, Law, and Strategy in the Startup Economyallowed a small group of law students to work with faculty and selected outside practitioners to engage a business to “identify, scope, research, and assess the significant legal, regulatory and business challenges and opportunities to the startup’s business model.” By the 2018-2019 academic year, the course received strong praise from participating students, with students giving a high average rating of 4.8 out of 5 for “Course Content and Evaluation” (evaluation records can be found by searching for “LAW, BUS, POL STRA STARTUP EC” in Stanford’s old Course Evaluation system available to students through Axess . The following year, however, the course ceased to be offered. Stanford law students took matters into their own hands by founding theSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Law Projectone year after the discontinuation of Business, Law, and Strategy in the Startup Economy. Although not as immersive as the experiential course, the project nonetheless offers students some exposure to startup work, allowing 15 law students per quarter, under the supervision of the legal aid nonprofitStart Small Think Big, to gain experience spending about 1-2 hours each week supporting Bay Area entrepreneurs. In the coming academic year, theArthur and Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance, a joint initiative of Stanford Law School and Stanford Graduate School of Business, will joinStart Small Think Bigto help guide law students in this work. Such support and interdisciplinary collaboration by the law school and business school is welcome, but more can be done to relaunch and build on Stanford’s startup business law experiential education opportunities for law students, including in ways that could also better benefit Stanford business students and other Stanford student entrepreneurs, as has been seen at the entrepreneurship law clinics of peer law schools such as Yale that serve startups from their own student populations. Even as the law school refrains from offering its students significant opportunities to service entrepreneurs, it has nonetheless led in other efforts to provide legal help to sustainability-focused ventures. In 2018, Stanford Law School and Stanford’s Precourt Institute for Energy, in partnership with former California Governor Brown and national climate policy leaders such as current White House Deputy National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi, launched theLawyers for a Sustainable Economy Initiative. The initiative matches low-income and social entrepreneurs of early-stage, sustainability-focused startups, including from the Stanford student and alumni community, with leading global law firms. So far, the law firms in the initiative have provided $55M in pro bono legal help to sustainability-focused startups and nonprofits over the last three years. The initiative’s pipeline of climate and environment-focused startups, including those run by Stanford students and alumni, could provide an incredible interdisciplinary opportunity in which Stanford law students could help Stanford business and engineering students launch their sustainability-focused ventures. Stanford Law School not only has the resources to provide its students with world-class programming on providing legal help to early-stage, sustainability-focused entrepreneurs, but is also well-placed to develop the world’s best such program. The law school has many potential avenues for such programming, whether through expanding its clinical offerings, providing additional support to the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Project, and/or adding newpolicy labsor classes. Not only would this better equip its students for jobs at the leading climate tech venture law firm practices that are both high-paying and drive positive impact on climate, but it would also better support Stanford’s community of sustainability-focused entrepreneurs. With the launch of the new school and the beginning of the academic year, now is an opportune time for Stanford Law School to join the rest of the University and lead on sustainability.

rice_thresher_2022_4,"Photo courtesy Simon Yellen BySimon Yellen11/8/22 11:39pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. The opinions represented here are my own and do not reflect those of the Honor Council as a whole. For the past year, I have served as an at-large representative on the Rice Honor Council. I have sat through dozens of cases, read hundreds of pages of evidence and spent countless hours working to improve the transparency and fairness of the Honor System. While there are a myriad of issues with the Honor System, as there are with any institutional system, there is one in particular that needs to be addressed with expediency. The Honor Council is currently not an effective deliberative body due to the general lack of engagement from some of its members, which include elected representatives. During the year that I have been a member, the Honor Council has met only half a dozen times as a larger body outside of individual cases. Of these meetings, half have been “bonding events” during which no Honor Council business was conducted or discussed. That leaves just three or four meetings amounting to well under ten hours of council-wide conversation over a 12-month period. But wait, it gets worse. These meetings normally only have a little over half of the sitting members in attendance. The quorum necessary to hold a vote or make any decisions is three-quarters of council members; there has not been a single meeting, bonding or otherwise, in the year I have been a member at which the quorum has been met. While there are council members who make an effort, the Honor Council as a whole is rendered ineffective by those who do not. While there is a process to remove members with poor participation, it requires a vote of the entire Council, which in turn requires quorum. This remarkable catch-22 makes it virtually impossible to implement any substantial changes to a system that needs substantial change. Despite several conversations regarding the topic, the Honor Council has yet to make a single substantive change to the Honor System in the past 12 months. If the current lack of participation continues, it is likely that few, if any, changes to the Honor System will be made in the coming year. The problem is that the Honor Council does not appreciate the gravity of its responsibilities, preventing Honor System improvements that should take at most months to deliberate on. Many Rice students might be alarmed to know that the group with the power to recommend grade reductions, suspensions or even expulsions spends a negligible amount of its time considering ways to improve this critical part of our university. While it is likely not deliberate, lack of participation by council members effectively silences the voices of those who elected them, whether it be their college or their class. To be fair, Rice students lead busy lives and finding time for anything beyond classwork is always a challenge. But the Honor Council is more than a club to make friends or bolster a resume; Honor Council decisions often determine the academic future of our peers. Honor Council members not only have a moral obligation to uphold the Honor Code through full participation, but we also have an obligation to our peers who are the mercy of the Council’s policies and deliberations and deserve to be judged by people who understand the significance of their actions The Honor Council Constitution begins with the words “We, the Student Body of Rice University.” At its core, the Honor Council is supposed to serve at the pleasure of the students, but we are currently not fulfilling that obligation. It seems we are incapable of making the internal changes needed to live up to the ideals upon which the Honor System was founded. But it is never too late. Just maybe, if enough people insist on more from the Honor Council, if they talk to their representatives and demand more accountability, then maybe there can be change after all.

crimson_2022_8,"“What goes around comes around.” These werethe words of now Supreme Court JusticeBrett M. Kavanaugh during the opening statement at his confirmation hearing. In those unprecedentedly partisan and hostile remarks, Kavanaugh railed against his political enemies,including“the Clintons” and unspecified “left-wing opposition groups.” The display was alarming to legal scholars who felt the threats undermined not only Kavanaugh’s credibility,but the legitimacy of the Court itself. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court announced it would hear a challenge to Harvard University’s race-conscious admissions policy. As University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in astatementresponding to the news, “The Supreme Court decision to review the unanimous decisions of the lower federal courts puts at risk 40 years of legal precedent granting colleges and universities the freedom and flexibility to create diverse campus communities.” Bacow is right to worry. Given that every lower court found Harvard’s admissions policy to be within the bounds of Supreme Court precedent, the fact that the justices are now taking up the matter suggests the conservative majority may plan to upend the law. Moreover, perhaps the University should be worried given Kavanaugh’s penchant for revenge. Harvard, through its law school, was Kavanaugh’s former employer. Prior to his nomination, hetaught at Harvard Law School for nearly a decade. Yet, in the wake ofseveral credible,high-profile,accusationsagainst Kavanaugh for sexual assault, the Harvard community might have given the justice a reason to exact his publicly promised retribution. Law students, alumni, and undergraduates rallied to demand that Harvard part ways with the scandal-plagued Trump nominee, who, to this day, maintains his innocence. In the fall of 2018, over 1,000 Harvard Law School graduates signed an openletterto the Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 asking “that the Law School rescind Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s appointment as the Samuel Williston Lecturer on Law, and that he not be allowed to teach on the January 2019 Winter Term.” Six out of seven then-current Harvard Law School student sections sent their own letters, demanding a Harvard-led investigation into then-faculty member Kavanaugh. “Allowing a person credibly accused of sexual assault to teach students prior to a full investigation surely creates a hostile environment for many students, and especially survivors,”read one letter. Then came thecarefully worded announcementfrom Associate Dean and Dean for Academic and Faculty Affairs Catherine Claypoole: “Judge Kavanaugh indicated that he can no longer commit to teaching his course in January Term 2019, so the course will not be offered.” (The president to whom Kavanaugh owes his appointment is famous for putting itanother way . While it all worked out for Kavanaugh, as things tend to for his ilk, at the time of Harvard’s decision his future was uncertain. Harvard’sannouncement came on Oct. 1, 2018. Kavanaugh was confirmed later that same week by one of theslimmest marginsin history. Just days before the U.S. Senate decided whether Kavanaugh would go down as yet another accused predator turned SNL punchline or be confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the nation’s highest court, the preeminent law school in the country seemingly weighed in. No doubt, the justice whopromised “consequences”remembers. Harvard’s lawyers should request Kavanaugh’srecusalfrom the admissions case. In fact, 28 U.S. Code § 455 onthe disqualification of a judgerequires that a judge or justice “shall disqualify himself in anyproceedingin which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” Though there isdebateover which rules of ethics bind Supreme Court justices, recusal is far from uncommon. The nine justices recused atotal of 145 timesover the 2019 term. Some may note that four other justices have connections to the Law School — Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Justice Elena Kagan each attended, and Kagan later served as dean. Yet none of these jurists publicly named their enemies and promised vengeance before the nation. Moreover, none were so publicly rebuked by the Harvard community at-large. Of course, there are strategic reasons to favor Kavanaugh’s recusal. Harvard students and students across the country are relying on the University to win this case; without Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s current 6-to-3 conservative-to-liberal supermajority slims to 5-to-3. But it is primarily for ethical reasons — not tactical ones — that we should publicly demand Kavanugh’s recusal. A vendetta-riddled justice should not decide a case about a policy that defines the diverse and vibrant Harvard community when that very community rejected him just years ago. Kaivan K.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_7,"In the era of social media, it is easier than ever to interact with celebrities and influencers online. With the rise of fandoms — a subculture that consists of groups of fans for a particular subject or person — and “stan culture” — a similar culture present online consisting of extremely devoted fans — another phenomenon arises, too: parasocial relationships. According toVerywell Mind, parasocial relationships are “one-sided relationships that a media user engages in with a media persona.” The dynamic of these relationships creates unfair expectations on the media persona and can result in mental health issues for both parties involved. When fans become attached to internet personalities or celebrities online, they begin to make assumptions about their lives and opinions. Parasocial relationships create a sense ofentitlementand obligation between both parties involved. Fans feel entitled to emotionally attach themselves to celebrities and assume they know everything about them, without ever actually knowing them personally. Fans also can place expectations based on their own perceptions of their favorite celebrities without realizing the impact it may have on the celebrities’ well being. Because of thisone-sidedaspect of the parasocial relationship, the celebrity is left to defend themselves not only against obsessive fans who pressure them to perform a certain way, but they are also forced to balance as not being seen as ungrateful for the fan base that contributed to their fame. One recent example of this is between singer and rapper Doja Cat and her fan base, when fans in Paraguay expressed their concerns on Twitter about Doja Cat not supporting those who waited outside her hotel in the rain after she canceled a concert due to the storm. Initially, Doja Cat reacted with frustration over the outrage and high expectations from her fans. The controversy led her to announce she is “quitting music.” A large fan base like Doja Cat’s tends to create high expectations over their favorite celebrity, which often results in the ultimate downfall for both parties involved. Fans are disappointed when the unrealistic expectations they set are not fulfilled, and celebrities deal with the consequences of setting their own personal boundaries. Due to the structure of parasocial relationships, mental health is one factor that can be greatly impacted. Fans who become emotionally attached to celebrities may develop an unhealthy obsession, and if celebrities let them down in any way, this can cause a fan’s mental health to drastically change. Especially if fans cling onto celebrities rather than real-lifefriendsin their lives, the mental impact is inevitable. Parasocial relationships allow for fewer feelings of loneliness and a sense of social interaction, but it comes with aprice: these relationships are limited, at a distance and frequently only fabricated in a fan’s mind. Adding on to one’s mental health, parasocial relationships allow fans to extract their personalities from a singular outside factor — in this case, the celebrity. A fan may feel pressured to support the celebrity they obsess over for anything and everything they do, even if that celebrity makes harmful decisions. Parasocial relationships cause fans to see tunnel vision by only focusing on their celebrity of choice and inheriting their personality characteristics, leading to a fan’s dramatic shift in their sense of self and their values. There are dangers with companies and celebrities who encourage this behavior, either by controlling how a celebrity is seen in order to appeal to the obsessed masses or by actions celebrities take when interacting with fans. For example, in the K-Pop industry, many celebrities areforbiddenfrom dating in order to be seen as “accessible” to fans. Celebrities themselves may give in to this behavior by continuously interacting with fans online and even developing friendships with their fans. While there’s nothing wrong with healthy celebrity-to-fan interaction, celebrities need to know where to draw the line if they don’t see this friendship continuing in the future. Otherwise, fans may feel encouraged to obsess over their favorite celebrity and develop the harmful aspects of the parasocial relationship. While parasocial relationships can feel just as fulfilling as in-person relationships, it’s important to realize the reality of the relationship. Celebrities, while most of them have their fans to thank for their fame, do not owe their fans anything. Celebrities do not know each of their individual fans personally, so fans should understand this boundary when they feel a sense of attachment to them. Camelia Heins is an Opinion Staff Writer.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_54,"For many cultures around the world who have been impacted by colonialism, the effects are still long-lasting on their youth. One of these effects manifests into a concept known as colonial mentality. Specifically for the Filipino American community, the effects of colonial mentality have a grip on adolescents’ mindsets, shaping everything from their mental health down to their perceptions of beauty. Whether it’s countries in South East Asia, like the Philippines or Vietnam, or countries in Africa, like Ghana or Nigeria, the colonial mentality affects each respective country’s culture in different ways. Some common effects of colonial mentality include loss of culture or language, changes in perceptions of beauty to fit a eurocentric standard and preference for values that align with the colonizer country’s culture. The United States is home to4.2 million Filipino peoplewith a significant amount residing in Southern California. UC Irvine has various student organizations dedicated to Filipino culture including one of the largest cultural organizations in Southern California —Kababayan at UCI. The current president of the UCI Filipino American Alumni Chapter, Dr. Christine Catipon, works closely with Kababayan at UCI. Catipon is a psychologist who works at the UCI Counseling Center and also serves as the Counseling Center liaison at UCI’s LGBT Resource Center. She defines colonial mentality as “the internalized perception of ethnic and cultural inferiority as a result of being colonized by another group.” For the Filipino community, hundreds of years of colonization from Spain, Japan and the United States has led to a seemingly universal colonial mindset for Filipinos, oftentimes with many not realizing its impact on their daily lives. Many Filipinos experience a loss of culture or language, especially for those who don’t live in the Philippines and live abroad in the United States or Canada, of which both are home to significant populations of Filipinos. The effects of colonialism also manifest through the perception of beauty such as with the issue of colorism — a preference for lighter skin or those of mixed heritage, favoring individuals who are thinner and believing those with fluency in English are superior than those with less experience in speaking it. Many older Filipinos won’t carry on aspects of their culture or language to their children, afraid it may taint them with accents or stereotypes that go against the status quo in the country they now reside in. Because of this, a great number of Filipino youth grow up not knowing about their culture or language, and if they do, it’s often watered-down, leading them to grow to hate their own culture or language in preference of the culture that surrounds them. “The Philippines’ history of colonization created uncertainty about what really defines our culture, to the point that many Filipinos now have feelings or otherness and shame about our Filipino culture and ourselves,” Catipon said. Kababayan at UCI’s currentCommunity AdvocacyCo-Coordinator Pammy Cabotaje reflected on her own experiences with colonial mentality. “As obscure as it sounds, it’s almost like I have a colonizer up in my head telling me that I’m not enough, that I have to constantly appeal to a white gaze in order to garner an ounce of respect,” she said. “Again, this mindset is unhealthy and I’m doing my best to not let that colonizer’s voice overpower my own self perception.” For many Filipinos, the colonial mentality is so deeply rooted in Filipino culture that it can be difficult for many Filipinos to identify it as an issue. “The interesting thing with Filipinos and colonial mentality is that most will not realize their perceptions about the world are from colonial mentality because it is so prevalent in the Filipino culture,” Dr. Catipon said. Despite how deeply integrated the effects of colonialism are in Filipino culture, newer generations are working on having discussions about these sensitive topics. Whether it’s in the media like Filipino American actress Asia Jackson’s#MagandangMorenxmovement combating colorism, or in the local community like in Kababayan’s “Kommuni-Tea Talks” about specific topics affecting the Filipino community, Filipino youths are increasingly having conversations about aspects of our culture that aren’t often discussed. “I think Filipino American youth have done a great job opening up spaces to discuss problems within the Filipino community like colorism, anti-blackness, and sexism, but this is just another topic that I hope has more light shed on it because it is something that often goes ignored or unheard of,” another current Kababayan Community Advocacy Co-Coordinator, Roni Medina said. Having conversations with fellow Filipinos about these topics and being open-minded about others’ personal experiences is the first step. Even if you aren’t Filipino, these experiences may resonate with your own culture. Even if you don’t believe you struggle with colonial mentality, it’s important to listen to those who do and not shame them for their experiences. “A lot of times I feel like discussions surrounding colonial mentality often target or blame individuals with backward ideas (such as our parents , but I hardly ever hear talks about the systems of neo-colonialism and American imperialism in the Philippines which produced this backward mentality in the first place,” Kababayan general member John Nonato said. “Basically, the discussions don’t really address the deeper roots of colonial mentality, and they kind of individualize the problem rather than seeing it as a systemic issue that can only be fixed by addressing the systems that reproduce it.” Although it’s difficult to recognize the colonial mentality present in yourself or in those around you, taking the steps to decolonize your mindset is crucial to battling the inner thoughts that may harm your mental health and self-perceptions. Catipon suggests “getting involved in the Filipino community and working with organizations to dismantle colonial mentality” and reaching out to mental health professionals with a similar cultural mindset to aid in your feelings of cultural inferiority. Changing your mindset takes time and it can be a difficult process. Know that you are not alone in these experiences and affirm yourself of your abilities separated from the hundreds of years of colonialism that has impacted your country. “You are not what the colonizer perceives you as. You are not inferior. You are not less than. You determine your own identity, your own worth, and your own self perception. You have the power to be who you want to be and no one has the right to diminish that,” Cabotaje said. Recognize that your culture is so much more than its colonized history. For Filipinos, our culture runs deep with united strength against colonizers and is rich with indigenous roots. “We are Filipino because we decided we are Filipino — because our ancestors decided that across islands of hundreds of different ethnicities and languages and peoples, we can unite under this Filipino identity to resist Spanish, Japanese and American colonizers,” Nonato said. “Our ancestors died fighting colonization because they loved our people and had hope for our people, and I hope you can feel the love of a million ancestors whenever you start feeling ashamed of your Filipino identity.” Camelia Heins is an Opinion Staff Writer.

wildcat_arizona_2022_32,"A crowd walked through the streets of the All Souls Procession Ceremony on Nov. 3, 2019. The Ceremony begins when the groups of people arrive at the Finale site. (Courtesy of All-Souls Procession, Photo by Kathleen Dreier I have a confession: I’m a Tucson native, a Hispanic and I’ve never been to the All Souls Procession. That changes this year. For the first time, I am going to walk on Sunday, Nov. 6, among the crowds of mourners to see what I have been missing. It’s not that I don’t celebrate Día de los Muertos. It’s a family tradition. Every year, my family gathers at home and follows our practices back to Sonora, Mexico. We set up an altar for my late grandmother, who passed away five years ago. We make sure to add a photograph of her and lay out all her perfumes that smell of flowers, mostly lavender, and her gold jewelry. We never forget the angel statues with candles; she would never forgive us if we left them off the altar. This is how I’ve always celebrated this traditional holiday — by bringing honor to my loved ones and keeping their memory alive. That is the goal of the All Souls Procession. In Southern Arizona where we meet border towns like Tucson, Día de los Muertos is a significant celebration for many Hispanic families and others. This event can be life-changing and emotional for many people who attend. “This is an event that you must experience yourself. The experience isn’t the same if you go to go; it’s better when you go with a heartfelt intention,” said Artistic Director Nadia Hagen. I find the diversity unique in this celebration. It’s not your traditional “Día de Los Muertos” event. It’s an event commemorating all souls. In the early 1990s, local artist Susan Johnson created the All Souls Procession. Grieving her father’s death, Johnson found comfort in her creativity, creating a celebration to commemorate and honor her father through a big ceremony. “Tucson is a special location that brings unity within our various communities,” Hagen said. “We want to make sure everyone feels included to join us in the celebration of life.” All-Souls starts with a parade full of colors, costumes, music, art and other entertainment. People, many of them with painted faces and masks, walk with their friends and families holding meaningful pieces that honor their deceased loved ones, including posters and pictures. “I’ve attended the All Souls Procession once in high school, and it truly was beautiful to see the lights, music and the altars,” said UA student Melanie Fellers. Today, more than 150,000 people take part in the event held at the Mercado shopping area on West Congress Street, just west of Downtown Tucson. “I felt emotional seeing families holding posters and pictures of their deceased loved ones ranging from youth to elderly. It’s a beautiful way to keep their souls alive,” said Fellers. I look forward to The Restoration of Care and Burning the Urn Ceremony. An urn is pulled through the streets of the procession and accompanied by the Attendant Spirit Group. For this installation, people are welcome to write messages and leave prayers or names, which are later burned and turned into ashes for the event’s finale. “This is the essential part of the night. I’ve seen people hold each other in tears, leaving their messages. I’ve seen others happy to have their messages passed on. It’s an emotional moment. It’s like experiencing another goodbye,” said Hagen I look forward to attending this event. It’ll give me a new perspective on how people honor their friends and family, just like I do with mine. Maybe once my message to my grandmother is burned, it’ll reach her on the other side. The 33rd annual All Souls Procession leaves Grande Avenue on Tucson’s west side at 6 p.m. and arrives at the Mercado District, 100 S. Avenida del Convento, off West Congress Street near Interstate 10, beginning at 7 p.m. The ceremony including the burning of the urn begins when most of the crowd has arrived at the final staging site. There is no cost and there will be food trucks set up in the Mercado District parking lot and several of the plaza’s restaurants will remain open through the ceremony. *El Inde Arizona is a news service of the University of Arizona School of Journalism.

ubyssey_2022_14,"Aug. 3, 2022 Written byStephanie Okoli Devontee eyed Chidinma down as she stabbed her baby spinach omelette. “You look terrible,” Devontee said. Chidinma stopped stabbing her dishevelled meal to stick her hand towards Devontee’s forehead. Devontee ducked out of the way. “In Jesus s name! Your hairline will be gone by the age of 23,” Chidinma said. “I rebuke it,” Devontee said in his terrible Nigerian accent. “You and this accent,” Chidinma said. “Yeah. That sounds offensive,” May said. Chidinma shot her eyes down at the sound of her voice. May smirked at her reaction. She slapped her tray on the cafeteria table, causing Chidinma to spring up. She flinched again at the sight of May glaring at her. Both carefully monitored each other as their bodies reached the table’s benches. “Hi,” May said. “Hi,” Chidinma replied. Devontee raised his eyebrows while his eyes darted between the two. “Uh…... hi,” Devontee said. “Are y’all good—-” “You’re Jamaican, right? So, why are you butchering that African accent?” “First, it’s Nigerian, and I’ve been told by some that my accent is iconic,” Devontee said. “Ha!” Chidinma said. “Second! What you just witnessed was an inside joke,” Devontee said. “And third, how did you know that?” “Chidinma…... told me,” May said. Her eyes hadn t left Chidinma since she sat down. “She told me a lot of things.” Chidinma took a deep breath as May’s violet rays shot out of her imagination. They gripped onto her eyes, and she heard her bones crack under the pressure of May’s unbelievable power. “Chidinma,” Devontee said. “What did you tell this girl?” Despite her unwavering PTSD, Chidinma still found the strength to roll her eyes. “A lot of things,” Chidinma said. “I don’t remember.” “You’re actually heat,” Devontee said. “Calgary slang,” May said. “Cute. Chidinma, we need to talk.” “Leave me alone,” Chidinma said. “Now, Chidinma, watch your tone,” May replied. May’s words poked at Chidinma’s ego. They pulled her eyes down to a squint and caused her lips to curl. “Leave me alone,” Chidinma said. She stretched out each syllable this time. So, May leaned in close. “I guess I’ll just have to get you to talk like last time,” May said through her gritted teeth. Chidinma’s eyes flickered frantically until they reached a golden hue. “Leave me thefuckalone,” Chidinma said. Devontee and May jumped back at the sound of Chidinma’s voice. Her usual warm voice with annoyed undertones was taken over by a raspy bellow, and her English was replaced by a language Devontee and May did not understand. They ignored the gold smoke being heaved out of Chidinma’s nose from her scowl. Her eyebrows furrowed so deep into her forehead that they made dents, and her eyes were reminiscent of a lion waiting for the right time to strike. May didn’t need to understand the language that came out of Chidinma’s mouth because her eyes told her everything she needed to know. May’s eyes rebutted with a surge of purple; violet static bulged out her eye sockets as May attempted her own snarl. Devontee quickly pulled himself together, placing his body between them. “Hey!” he said. “Both of you need to calm down. Whatever’s going on between you two is not worth the white jackets coming in and snatching us all up by the neck. Breathe.” The girls’s eyes were washed over with white until their pupils went back to dark brown. “And since when did you learn Igbo?” Devontee said. “Huh?” Chidinma said. “That language you were speaking right now… with your newfound demon voice,” he said. Chidinma rubbed her temple. “It sounds a lot like Chioma when she would lecture you.” “Chioma,” Chidinma thought. Her eyes turned red at the sound of her mentor’s name. “I’ve got to go. “Chidinma,” Devontee said. “Are you okay—” “Hey, you!” May said. She dug her index finger in Chidinma’s chest. “We still need to talk.” “Argh!” Chidinma said. She stood up and stomped to the cafeteria’s exit. Devontee turned to May. “Look what you’ve done.” “Bye,” May said. “I-,” May shut Devontee up by whipping her curly dreadlocks onto his face as she swung around to stand up. “You got hair in my mouth,” he said. “All a part of the dramatic exit,” May said. She began to skip to the sound Chidinma’s footsteps smashing against CSIS headquarters s ceramic tiles. “Women,” Devontee said. He shook his head and went back to his breakfast. “Chidinma,” May said. May’s chant bounced off the grey walls of the servicewomen s residence. “Leave me alone!” Chidinma said. “Stupid girl.” “Excuse you?” May exclaimed. Her eyes lit up from the purple rays that poured out of her sockets. She smiled as they squirmed around like tentacles. “Chidinma,” she sang. “Chidinma!” “What?” Chidinma said as she turned around. “Oh shit!” She tripped over her own foot. Chidinma tried to get up, but her trembling limbs stopped her from getting a proper footing. Reduced to a mouse, she started scurrying on the floor. May laughed at the view. “What is wrong with you? Why are you so scared?” May said. “Oh right, you’ve never been on a real field mission.” “That shit is for the birds!” Chidinma said. “All of you are so ready to die for a country that doesn’t care if you make it back or not.” “You expect me to listen to the girl cowering on the floor… boo!” Chidinma flinched. “You’re in the big leagues now. You need to man up unless you want everyone to find out about you and Devontee’s little secret,” May laughed. “You mean our little secret,” Chidinma said. “Last time I checked, there’s only one of us breaking into people’s rooms to suck the life out of them for fun!” “Relax,” May said. “I just took enough life energy to learn about what you know about 9-7-5-6-7.” “And since you know I know nothing, why can’t you leave me alone!” Chidinma said. “Because you’ve been chosen to-,” May said “Girl, I ain’t Luke Skywalker!” Chidinma said. “Stop with all this nonsense.” “Look,” May replied. “Let’s just talk.” “No!” replied Chidinma. “Why?” said May. “Because you are insane!” said Chidinma. She spotted her room number and sprinted for the door. “No!” May said. May shot out her new limbs, but Chidinma heard thecracking soundof May’s new appendages. “Turn around, Chi-chi,” a familiar voice said. It sounded like Chioma. So, Chidinma charged her fists with energy. And when they finally shone gold, she punched them in May’s direction. “You little bitch,” May said as she used her tentacles to block Chidinma’s attack. Chidinma didn’t have time to celebrate her victory. Instead, a hazy black figure attached to the wall flickered like static. It inched closer and closer towards Chidinma. A jolt zipped through Chidinma’s spine. The adrenaline was enough to get her to her door. As soon as she opened it, she slammed it as if it would stop the terrors behind it. Chidinma ran to her bathroom sink and started splashing water on her face. “Why me?” she said. She choked on the lukewarm water. “Why?” “Chidinma,” the voice said. “Get out,” Chidinma said. “Chidinma,” the voice said. “Get out.” “Chidinma,” the voice, which was now a figure, said. “Get out!” Chidinma said. “You’re not real.” With each heave, gold smoke poured out of her mouth. The shimmers from the smoke attached to Chidinma’s dark brown skin and the gold weaved into her shrunken afro, creating freeform locs. The smoke reached through the mirror and pulled Chioma out of the shadowy figure. “Auntie Chioma?! What’s happening to me? How’d you do that? Did I do that? How’d the fuck did I do that?! This is not how my life is supposed to be,” Chidinma said. “Chi-chi,” Chioma said.“Breathe.I’ll explain everything when you’re in a… calmer state. Have you been eating?” “You’reasking me about my diet… now?” “Sorry, eh, sorry,”Chioma said. “As of right now, I need you to do something for me. After you calm down, I need you to go talk to May.” “No,” Chidinma said. “Chi-chi, Chi-baby, please. Do it for me.” “Okay, auntie,” Chidinma said. “Bye, for now.” Chioma evaporated into the gold smoke. Chidinma took a minute to cry. After, she closed her eyes and took a long deep breath, but she was still in her new form when she opened her eyes. “Still sparkly and I look like the Black version of Goku. Just great. My voice!” Chidinma said. She retook a deep breath, but no remarkable change happened. “I need something stronger,” she thought. Chidinma ran to her bed and pulled a Nike shoebox from under it. She flipped the top open to reveal half a pre-roll. “Not enough,” Chidinma said. She grabbed a hoodie and toque from the floor, threw them on and headed for the door. She jumped at the sight of May leaning on her door frame. “Don’t worry, everywhere is soundproof, so I didn’t hear your mental breakdown, May said. Why are you sparkly?” “Do you burn?” said Chidinma. “Huh?” said May. “You smoke?” said Chidinma. “Depends,” said May. “Bush?” said Chidinma. “I’m assuming you mean weed,” said May. “And yes, I do.” “Know where we can get some for cheap?” said Chidinma. “I know a guy in Jane and Finch,” said May. “Great. We can talk on the way,” Chidinma said. Read thefirstandsecondchapter ofThe Servicewoman.

crimson_2022_109,"Dear Judge Ketanji — pronounced “kuh-tahn-jee” — Brown Jackson ’92, you are my role model. You are the embodiment of a successful Black woman and the blueprint for Black girls everywhere. You are the coalition of the strength of our Black mothers and our ancestors’ greatest pride. You are the inspiration of my Harvard experience and a pioneer for defining what Black excellence is within white America. Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, as an alum of Harvard, you are one of the greatest to have walked these halls. I write this with intentional and precise wording. You are not one of the greatest Harvard has produced. Harvard did not produce you. Harvard was merely a stepping stone for your illustrious career and achievements. You are among the alumni that make Harvard one of the greatest universities in the world. Your presence is the very reason that so many others flock to this school. All in hopes of becoming like you. You make this University. Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, our skin tone is one that incites riots. One that causes us to be murdered freely and unjustifiably. One that subjects us to experiencingthree timesthe amount of police brutality than our white counterparts and subjects us to the constant injustice of legal processes. One that shimmers in the sunlight and protects our cells from UV rays. One that invokes creativity and creates entirely new genres of music. One made up of resilience so strong, that after years of the generational trauma we have experienced, we still hold our heads high and fight for what is ours. Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, as you looked into the eyes of those who despise you during your confirmation hearing, you smiled a toothy grin that made them seethe on their podiums. Your smile beamed with the aura of unrivaled and unadulterated progress. Your intelligence scared and intimidated those upon the stand who could not believe that a woman of your “background” could ever be so qualified. You proved exactly to this country just how qualified you were, and just how overqualified other Black women have to be in this country. Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, you are one of the most qualified Supreme Court Justices currently appointed to uplift, serve, and enforce our country’s constitution. You being exceedingly knowledgeable and experienced is of no doubt in my mind not a coincidence. Being a Black woman you know what it is like to fight for a seat at the table. You know you must be the most versed within the room to even have a mere place among the discussion in white America. Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, your tears shed on the Senate floor have not gone unnoticed. Your prideful posture that commands a room does not go unnoticed. Your intricately woven locs that adorn your crown and arouse feelings of prejudice in others do not go unnoticed. The eloquent manner in which you speak your words and answer back the racist remarks circling the Senate chamber only speaks to the composition of your being. The happiness upon your face as you were confirmed for the seat as a Supreme Court Justice — which persisted even while others disrespectfully walked out — only adds to your magnificent character. Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, as you fought for confirmation and the court voted for you, two Republican senators arrived in casual clothing to show rebellion. But that did not deter you. You continued with your head held high, reaffirmed with the vigor of our ancestors cheering you on, and went on to make history. As a Harvard student, this only pushes me to do more. To achieve the dreams I have without hesitation even if I haven’t seen someone who looks like me do it before. You showed me that a little Black girl from Miami inside you can go on to make history. You showed me that the little Black girl from Kentucky inside me can go on to make history. Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, I clapped for you and imagined being on the front row as you were being confirmed. Dear Ketanji Brown Jackson, you are the shining fruit of our ancestors’ past suffering and will forever go down in history as a part of the definition of Black Excellence. Dear Judge Ketanji — pronounced “kuh-tahn-jee” — Brown Jackson, you are my role model. Kelisha M. Williams ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Matthews Hall."
thetech_mit_2022_29,"In the past year and a half, I’ve emerged from what I now realize was the most challenging period of my adult life. The other day, it hit me that I am no longer dreading waking up each day, dreading the start of each week, dreading working on my research. It was hard to comprehend how much dread and unhappiness I was experiencing at the time. I knew I was unhappy, but happiness felt like such a distant memory that I couldn’t even see how far away I had gotten from it. I almost forgot how good happiness and contentment could feel. I got glimpses of it, a few hours or days at a time, but then a wall would slam back down, and I felt terribly stuck in my unhappiness. I hit what some call “the third-year slump” of my PhD, and I hit it hard. COVID-19 isolation and a stressful workload triggered the start of a depressive episode. I was floundering, trying to find a research topic that mattered and that I found interesting, but nothing felt interesting to me. I hated the research I was doing every day. I was completely burnt out, but I was not able to take a long enough break to remedy that. What I was feeling was so different from anything I had ever experienced. My normal quick fixes for a bad mood, like making a comforting meal, didn’t seem to help. In fact, they even pushed me deeper into despair because it felt like nothing was working, and I couldn’t see a way out. Then someone in my life died — horribly, suddenly — of suicide. I felt like I was hit by a truck. All the life was knocked out of me. For a week I could do nothing but cry, sleep, and watch television. I was in so much pain because I felt an extraordinary amount of guilt. I kept replaying our last interactions and wondering what I should have said differently, what I should have done differently, why I hadn’t reached out more recently, why I hadn’t read more into warning signs. It still hurts when I think about it. However, this loss was also a turning point for me. Somehow it revealed to me that life is serious. Life is not a game. If I let my mental health continue to slide, then it could cost me my will to be here. This is not to say that I was actively suicidal at any point, but that I was depressed and that the abstract concept of suicide was crossing my mind more frequently than was healthy. The loss of my friend shook me in part because it made me think about the difference between myself and a person struggling with suicidal thoughts, and I realized that there was not as much of a difference as I’d thought there was. I started taking care of myself more. Not self-care in the “do a face mask and order take out” kind of way that I had been doing, but in the serious, this really matters, this is the only life I get to live kind of way. I realized that I didn’t feel depressed while I was out in nature for a few hours, so I started hiking more. I remembered how painting and artistic pursuits gave me balance, and I started oil painting again. I reconnected with the meditative state that running could put me in, and I started running longer and longer distances. I started taking my therapy sessions more seriously, opening up to my therapist instead of dragging myself through each session. I began saying no to getting involved in student leadership responsibilities that I knew would overwhelm me. I stopped feeling guilty for putting myself first and taking care of myself. I want to enjoy my life. I want to wake up every day and feel content. And it’s been working. And it’s amazing. Sometimes it doesn’t feel real that I can enjoy my life again. I encountered a quote about depression in a book recently and it resonated with me. The quote reads: “My mother crawled out of her deep, dark tunnel, but perhaps this phrasing is too imprecise, the image of crawling too forceful to encapsulate the relentless but quiet work of fighting depression. Perhaps it is more correct to say that her darkness lifted, the tunnel shallowed, so that it felt as though her problems were on the surface of the Earth again, not down in its molten core.” —Transcendent Kingdom, Yaa Gyasi I put in work to become mentally healthy again. When I was stuck in my depression, I thought that I was working hard to get out of it by just surviving each day. Really, I was dragging myself along, crawling through an infinite tunnel, and not making any progress. The real hard work was in choosing myself and my happiness: prioritizing balance, boundaries, and making time for the things that make me feel alive. These actions are what caused the darkness to lift, the tunnel to shallow, the journey to become manageable enough that I was able to make my way through it. At one point in my depression, my therapist pointed out that I could consider dropping out of my PhD program. The idea both terrified and thrilled me. She was right; I had two options in front of me: stay in my PhD program and make changes to improve my mental health or drop out. I could not keep going as I had been before. I ended up choosing to stay in grad school, but this choice has required me to change the way I do grad school. I do not skip a weekend hike for research. I do not cut my runs short to spend more time debugging code. I do not miss out on social events to perfect a presentation. This is the way that I have found for me to be able to do grad school and stay mentally healthy, and that is all that matters — not how my labmates do grad school, not how my peers do grad school, not how my perfectionism wants me to do grad school, not even how my advisors want me to do grad school. Your mental health is more important than getting an A, submitting a conference paper, or hitting your degree milestones on time. This is your only life. Learn to treat yourself with the respect that you deserve. You deserve to enjoy your life. You do not have to earn happiness through suffering. Learn to treat yourself with the compassion and grace that you would extend to a friend, that I wish I could have extended to my friend if I had known how much they were suffering before their death.

stanforddaily_2022_31,"An insurgent intellectual movement is active within the American right. Its political philosophy has been labeled under many terms, from right-wing populism or neo-nationalism, to national conservatism (which members themselves favor . Thecommentariat refers to itsimply as the “New Right,” borrowing the term from William F. Buckley and Barry Goldwater’santithetical conservative coalitionthat materialized in the mid-20th century. Regardless of its name, this New Right’s central contention is clear: Conservatism as we know it has failed, and the Republican Party must cast it aside. According to the New Right, free-market orthodoxy is stale and uninspired. Trade protectionism, industrial subsidies and aggressive antitrust enforcement are the future. Conservatives’ obsession with maintaining the “social fabric” has long kept them from pursuing cultural triumph by any means necessary. Therefore, established right-wing values such as politeness and prudence are overrated and denote weakness; winning is far better. Sustained American involvement on the world stage, easing the federal government out of the entitlement business and openness to legal immigration are other outdated notions that need to go. Principally, the New Right aims to mold the general temperament and instincts of Donald Trump into something a bit more refined anda touch more coherent. Emerging at the helm of the New Right are a few individuals who, while seemingly unconnected at first glance, share a core network of links with Stanford University. Far and away, the movement’s chief financial backer is billionaire tech titanPeter Thiel, the man who co-founded PayPal and Palantir and provided Facebook with its earliest outside investment. His very first entrepreneurial venture, however, was The Stanford Review, a right-wing student publication that exists to this day on our campus, decades after Thiel started the paper as an undergraduate. One member of Stanford’s class of 2002 who wrote for The Stanford Review isJosh Hawley, who now serves as the junior U.S. senator from Missouri and the New Right’s foremost legislative combatant. Senator Hawley’s various endeavors — leading a charge to challenge the 2020 election results,drafting a billto break up “Big Tech” and delivering thesole opposing votein admitting Sweden and Finland to NATO — have made him a darling of the national conservative crusade. For his efforts, the young lawmaker was rewarded witha keynote speech at the faction’s 2021 flagship conference, alongside Thiel. In early 2022, Thielannouncedthat he would leave his long-held board seat at Facebook and instead focus on propelling various midterm candidates to victory.By May, he had supplied $10 million eachto PACs supporting two swing state Republican Senate candidates, both of whom were experienced venture capitalists, yet complete political newcomers. One isOhio’s J.D. Vance, previously known as an adamantly anti-Trump, soft-spoken social conservative who wrote a scathing critique of white, working-class America’s victim mentality in his 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. No longer. Backed by Thiel’s funding, Vance has reintroduced himself as a populist firebrand with his regular appearances on Tucker Carlson’s television program andcomments lamenting American aid to Ukraine. Fittingly, in an October primary forum,Vance cited Josh Hawleyas the sitting senator he would most emulate if elected. The second beneficiary of Thiel’s financing isBlake Masters of Arizona, the mogul’s longtime protégé, whoresigned from his positionsas COO of Thiel’s family office and president of his charitable foundation to launch a bid for John McCain’s former seat. Masters — yet another Stanford alumnus — has toed the New Right line to a tee, garnering a reputation as“an America First conservative” and “hard-line nationalist”who promotes minimal foreign engagement, despises globalization and advocates clamping down on legal immigration. Candidates Vance and Mastersboth quickly received the endorsement of Senator Hawley, whom they will work beside next year, provided they win their respective general elections. In sum, Stanford has not only produced the New Right’s largest donor and arguably its mastermind in Peter Thiel, but also its most prominent officeholder in Josh Hawley and one of its two leading congressional candidates in Blake Masters. It’s not as though all elite universities possess the same ideological record on the right side of the aisle. For instance,Harvard has served as the alma mater of four sitting Republican senators, all of whom exemplify the conventional conservatism that champions small government, economic liberty and assertive foreign policy. Dartmouth has contributed two more senators in the same vein. Princeton gave us Ted Cruz, a Tea Party favorite. Meanwhile, Stanford’s sole alumnus in the Senate Republican Conference is the aforementioned Hawley, whose unorthodox policy convictions starkly contrast those of his Ivy League colleagues. Why is it that Stanford’s unique flavor of right-wing politics yearns to tear down so much of traditional American conservatism? Perhaps its proponents are simply acting upon the tech industry mantra that best embodies our school’s innovative and restless spirit: “Move fast and break things.” Forged by a cadre of Stanford men, the New Right is attempting to do just that. Silicon Valley, as well as the university that dispenses so many of its finest minds, thrives on the ability to swiftly shake up old institutions with antiquated ways of doing things — and there are few American institutions older than the GOP. If electronic payments, search engines and home entertainmentall received their reinventions courtesy of Stanford, it makes sense that conservatism would get the same treatment. And if the revolutionaries are to succeed, the Republican establishment must fall. The New Right is akin to PayPal, Google and Netflix, out to disrupt and dethrone the old right’s Mastercard, AltaVista and Blockbuster Video. While the question of whether the New Right will eventually command the party is unknowable, the movement’s origins are anything but. Quite the contrary; we’re walking their halls as we speak.

wildcat_arizona_2022_24,"An image of a ticket booth on fire by Emilie Cuevas. When Taylor Swift announced her 10th studio album,Midnights, I was ecstatic. I stayed up for the release and the surprise announcement that turned out to be another seven songs. When she announced “The Eras Tour,” I jumped at the chance to sign-up for Ticketmaster’sVerified Fan Program, which allows fans to have access to a presale of tickets for a show they are interested in. On Nov. 14, I received an email saying I was chosen for presale and was given a code. I texted my Swift group chat, and my friends decided that I was in charge of getting tickets for my friends and me. On Nov. 15, I logged onto Ticketmaster and waited for my chance to be able to snag tickets. When I bought tickets in the past, it has never taken so long to get tickets; I waited for four hours. When it was my turn to pick tickets, it was a race against time. Since I was buying four tickets, it was hard for me to find that many together. The site said my credit card was not authorized whenever I put tickets in my cart. I tried another card, and it gave me the same message. I was shaking so badly. I had waited for over a decade to see Swift and wanted desperately to go on this tour. I gave up when the site crashed for the third time. I was devastated. I thought I had let my friends down. I checked into the site a couple of hours later, and to my surprise, there were still tickets left! I noticed the prices had increased by about $50. I was able to purchase four tickets in the 400 section for $99 each, but each ticket had $40 in fees. There were only supposed to be 1.5 million people getting tickets, but Ticketmasterlogged14 million people using its site when tickets were on sale. In the same blog post, Ticketmaster said they did not think all of the fans who got presale codes would log into the site to secure their tickets. They severely underestimated Swift’s fanbase, which is one of the biggest in the world, with a staggering 82.4 millionlistenerson Spotify. They knew how many codes they sent out, so they should have prepared so much better for Swift’s tour. I am thankful that I was able to purchase tickets, but that was not the case for thousands of other fans. Ticketmasterreleaseda statement on Twitter saying they were unprepared for the number of fans buying tickets from the presale. On Nov. 16, the Capital-One Presale happened for people with Capital-One cards, which was also ahorrible experiencefor fans. With site crashes, people getting kicked out of their queue and codes not working, Ticketmaster was unprepared for both presales. On Nov. 17, Ticketmasterannouncedthey canceled the general sale of the tour, and people were outraged. Many fans did not get a presale code, and if they didn’t have a Capital-One card, they relied on the general sale to get their tickets.Ticketmaster’s largest shareholderblamed Swift for their site being unable to handle the traffic the presales generated. Swift responded via herInstagram story, saying that the experience was “excruciating for her to just watch mistakes happen with no recourse.” She did speak out about the fiasco, but she has the power to do so much more than make a statement on her social media. RELATED:OPINION: Taylor Swift releases another great album with ‘Midnights’ Swift has been releasing merchandise regularly and released four versions of her album on vinyl and CDs sinceMidnightsdropped. The four vinyl versions ofMidnightsmake a clock when they are put together. On her online store, she is selling CD clocks so her fans can hang up the four versions on their walls. All of her merchandise is expensive but cheaply made. Her first single, “Anti-Hero,” has five remixes and was first only available for purchase on her online store. She knows her fans will buy merchandise and purchase all of the remixes. She is making quite a lot of money this year, and all at the expense of her fans. Swift is in no shortage of money, and she needs to speak out about how unfair Ticketmaster has been to her fans – if only to not seem greedy. Ticketmaster has been facing scrutiny for being unfair and having outrageous fees. Scalpers can buy tickets and resell them for thousands of dollars on sites like StubHub, and they know desperate fans will buy them because seeing Swift in concert is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Ticketmaster’s parent company, Live Nation, is nowunder investigationby the Department of Justice because of its monopoly on live music events. I was disappointed in the process of getting tickets and felt horrible for fans who could not get tickets. Ticketmaster needs to do better when it comes to selling tickets for concerts, and Swift needs to take action against Ticketmaster. She should use her overwhelming power to help the fans she says she so publicly loves. Follow Kelly Marry onTwitter Kelly Marry (she/her is a sophomore majoring in journalism and public relations.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_42,"Outdoor dining proved itself effective and well-conceived during the COVID-19 crisis, lightening the burden on local restaurants in pandemic conditions. Assistance for businesses was achieved by emergency measures approved by local authorities. With the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and boosters, business owners, consumers, and authorities start wondering about the future of outdoor dining: Is it here to stay? The restaurant industry suffered early in the pandemic due to the fear of the virus and the consequent limitations on indoor dining. To remedy this, Orange County local lawmakers allowed business owners to move dining spaces out to the sidewalks and parking spaces. According to theOrange County Register, entire streets were shut down to accommodate outdoor shopping and dining attractions in cities including Laguna Beach, Orange and Fullerton. The solution is widely considered successful in helping businesses weather COVID-19 restrictions. Sales tax data shows how successful the Promenade on Forest, an outdoor dining plaza in Laguna Beach, has been. According to Laguna BeachMayor Sue Kempf, local revenue took a nosedive early in the pandemic, but after the outdoor dining measure was implemented, it increased back to nearly pre-pandemic levels in just six months. So why was this way of dining not popular before? Under pre-COVID-19 California law, restaurants had to expand their liquor permit in order to serve outdoors. State Lawmaker Scott Winer shared his thoughts regarding the process in an interview with the New York Times. “It could be a lengthy, difficult process, with appeals. During the pandemic, the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control issuedemergency guidancethat said if a city allowed it, they could expand alcohol sales outside,” Winersaid. While cities relaxed permit restrictions to support local businesses and please customers, some restrictions are slowly returning. In as early as May of 2021, The Voice of San Diegoreportedthat city staff wanted to set up a more intensive permit approval process, which includes holding local restaurants’ temporary structures up to a more uniform code. The city of San Clemente once allowed restaurants to pay for outdoor spaces, but all the outdoor dining attractions along the town’s center at Avenida Del Mar were mandated toclose downearlier this year. Local business owners also voiced their concerns about the closing of outdoor dining. “If we are allowed to keep outdoor dining structures , it will help us recover,” Chelsea Coleman, owner of the Rose wine bar in South Park, San Diegosaid. The restaurant industry has gone far to adjust to the new reality of outdoor dining: building new parklets and other outdoor spaces to generate business and allow the customers to enjoy the outdoor weather and ambiance. Yet, with the uncertainty of outdoor dining’s future, business owners have been left confused. Tony Loiacono, the owner of Parkhouse Eatery in University Heights, San Diego,saidhe invested $14,000 to build his outdoor dining structure, which helped increase his capacity under COVID-19 restrictions by 100%. However, with the new policies, no one seems to be sure whether it was technically legal. “They were very vague with what we were able to do and not do,” Loiaconosaid.

ubyssey_2022_4,"Sept. 27, 2022 Written byTiana Mori Taking the first step toward seeking counselling and therapy can be really intimidating if you’re new to accessing these supports, especially in times of distress. As someone who has been through this process, I’ve compiled some information that may help you or others seeking help to take that first step. In my experience, it’s best to read up on the AMS/GSS Health & Dental Plan to find a private therapist service in BC. As of September 2022, if you are enrolled in the AMS/GSS Health & Dental Plan, you have coverage for private psychotherapy with most mental health professionals for up to $1,250 per policy year (September 1, 2022 to August 31, 2023 . This can be equivalent to eight to ten sessions, depending on your therapist’s session rate. Before your first session, you need to ensure your practitioner has licensing covered by Pacific Blue Cross. StudentCare outlines the following positions are coverable: “licensed psychologist, registered clinical counsellor, licensed psychological associate registered with the College of Psychologists of British Columbia, or have a Master’s degree in Social Work.” These will look something like ‘PhD,’ ‘R.C.C.,’ ‘L.P.A.’ or ‘M.S.W.,’ respectively, next to the therapist’s name in the listing. Once you’ve checked this, you know that you can be reimbursed for mental health services. Reimbursement for eligible mental health services is typically processed through an online claim submission. Here’s the general process: Here’s a step-by-step of how to submit a claim: Payment and claiming are just one component of accessing private mental health services. There’s also picking a therapist, learning what kind of therapy is best for you and of course, going to therapy. This guide is a snapshot into what accessing mental health services looks like as a student. Wishing you the best in your mental health journey.

rice_thresher_2022_49,"ByLeonard Chan3/1/22 10:59pm After reading the Thresher Editorial Board’s “Alumni: If the statue news upset you, think about why” from Feb. 1, 2022, I came to the realization that the discussion of Rice’s history and the history of its benefactors should by no means end there. While the focus has primarily been on the university’s origins, we also need to recognize and confront our past with more recent events instead of brush through them. For example, the university benefited from the largest corporate scandals in a generation with Enron and Arthur Andersen. Yet, alumni ignore or willfully forget its role in helping build the university despite its name still being seen in prominent buildings such as the Baker Institute while students remain painfully left in the dark of Enron-related crimes. Meanwhile, the name gracing as well as the funding for the newly completed opera house may also prove problematic. The legal process remains pending for Robert Brockman in the largest tax evasion case in American history. These issues, of course, pale in comparison due to the darkness of slavery associated with the university’s namesake, but no matter how many individuals have benefitted from the rewards of illicit activity, it does not justify the pain endured by those affected. The impact of these cases are still felt, especially in Houston. This conversation can be even more uncomfortable as a good number of active alumni regretfully spent parts of their careers with corrupt organizations. History can be inconvenient, and ignoring it as we have been represents tacit approval. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

From 1999-2008, he attended Ravenswood schools Edison Brentwood Elementary and Ronald McNair Middle School. He is currently finishing his second year of his Ph.D. in Modern Thought & Literature at Stanford. I still remember the smell of powder — not the kind that once flooded our streets, but the kind that filled our classrooms. The chalked hands of my school’s sole music teacher hovered over us. We sat “criss-cross applesauce” on the carpet, its thin layer of shag not much of a cushion between our cabooses and the floor. Huddled together, all thirty-two of us, we were trying to decipher the sheet music our teacher had just given us.A song?Tania cried out,What’s that got to do with the STAR test?Marcel seconds her dissent:Ayo, ain’t we supposed to be doing math problems or something? But Ms. Parker would have none of it. “Back to the top guys, c’mon, we only got 40 minutes here. And don’t just say the words. Reallylistento them. Understand the meaning.” Like a broken faucet, the words spill out in stutters, lumps of syllables that betrayed our confusion. But eventually, after endless loops of the song on the old Panasonic stereo, our voices flowed into a single stream of I’s. I Know I Can Be What I Wanna Be If I Work Hard on It I’ll Be Where I Wanna Be * If I had to encapsulate my experience as a K-8 student in Ravenswood School District, it would be this moment with Ms. Parker in Edison Brentwood Academy: her insistence, and the insistence of countless educators who stayed despite the low pay, that Black and Brown children are only captives to our imaginations. No zip code, no conservatorship by the state or a county grand jury, noonewould determine our outcome in life but us. “I Know I Can” by Nasir Jones. Throughout my whole career as a Ravenswood kid, I carried the Queensbridge poet’s words with me. But as inspiring as Nas’s words were and still are to me, my years in higher education and public service have made me realize that our public schools, like the cities in which they’re housed, can only flourish as much as we invest in them. Displacement, a high cost of living and a hyper-saturation of schools in our small city have taken their toll on our district. And in 2020, citing budget cuts and precipitous declines in enrollment, the school board closed Brentwood as well as Belle Haven Elementary School. On the upcoming June ballot, residents of East Palo Alto and Belle Haven will consider a measure that would, if passed,provide 110 million dollarsin bonds to the Ravenswood School District. The district plans to dedicate the majority of those funds to modernize Costaño Elementary School and Cesar Chavez Ravenswood Middle School. Many of the aging portables have outlived their temporary use. Buildings have remained largely untouched since the 1950s. Beyond replacing these portables with permanent classrooms, Measure I seeks to upgrade the efficiency and technology of elementary schools in the area. Some will argue that we shouldn’t give more to a school district that has already received measures in the past. “Antonio,” they say, “haven’t we given enough?” How may I adequately respond by summarizing the history of inequality in a single breath? How may I convince parents, who have perhaps attended Ravenswood themselves and had a less-than-memorable experience, that a single measure will not undo decades of redlining, blockbusting and white flight, on top of a weak tax base? We need decades’ worth of resources to repair decades of damage. Others will be blunter in their assessments. “Why should I give to a district that’s mismanaged funds in the past?” The logic behind this statement seems almost biblical, arguing that children must inherit the mistakes of their predecessors. By that same logic, is our own city then ineligible for state and federal aid? Is the fact that our children were and will continue to be taught there not enough of a reason to support Ravenswood? To the anti-reform skeptics, I wish to remind you that on the road to self-determination, even nations err. We are a young city that has had less than forty years to position itself on a par with centuries-old municipalities. As the great Bob Hooversaidin an interview for “Dreams of a City” (a documentary filmed in the late 1990s about East Palo Alto , “Unfortunately, none of us are experts in the area of community development, of building a city, so we are kind of learning as we go along. This is on-the-job training.” What value is there in continuing to point fingers? Let’s join hands. Yes, we must learn from the past, but why let it obscure the present? And that present is the fact that, over the years, Ravenswood leadership has taken countless steps to improve the quality of learning for its students. In 2008, the same year I graduated from Edison McNair Academy (now Los Robles , the district partnered up with concerned educational advocates and philanthropists to create Ravenswood Education Foundation (REF , whose private funds have increased instructional quality through coaching and collaboration time, enrichment in the arts, SEL support, and more. Just this past year alone, REF has raisedover 9 million dollarsfor Ravenswood. Recently, REF has implemented a program that matches teacher pay viz. neighboring districts to ensure we hire the best and brightest educators. Just this past month, the Robotics team at Chavez went to the world robotics championship! And just the other day, as I distributed Measure I literature, I had a conversation with Liliana, a first grader at the Los Robles dual immersion program. She practically spoke better Spanish than I did. And in a city where two thirds of the population is Latino, in a state where Latinos are the largest ethnic minority, we must equip our children, regardless of their backgrounds, with the skills they need to tackle their tomorrow. This is a school board with skin in the game. This is a district that believes a child should not have to travel outside their own community in order to receive a good education. As school leaders, parents and fellow elected officials, we are all on mission to make Ravenswood second to none. This is not just the letter of a policymaker. This is a letter of appeal as an alumnus, as a born and raised East Palo Altan whose entire life was transformed due to education, including my time at Ravenswood. This is not a showcase of poverty, nor is it a feel-good story of an alumnus who “succeeded.” This is one of many stories throughout the country of school districts that, like the cities they are in, struggle to retain the communities they serve. This is a song that our children have been singing, but our bickering voices have muted theirs. This is a call for self-accountability, for us to recognize that so long as we as a community divest from our institutions of learning — our public schools — they will continue to struggle. In spite of how the years have hardened me, I am still singing that song alongside our children. I hope that by voting Yes on Measure I, and through your donations and volunteering to canvas alongside us, you will too."
stanforddaily_2022_89,"Stanford’sDisability Community Space(DCS opened last week, a monumental change that disability advocates — including myself — have been fighting for, for years. We had a virtual opening, in which people played games, talked, and reveled in the long-sought reward for our efforts. Various administrators showed up on Zoom to bask in the roles they had played in the process. I recently had a conversation with a professor who praised theColor GenomicsCOVID-19 system that Stanford employs. Students, faculty and staff use at-home testing kits, placing samples in test tubes and activating the kits by inputting barcodes into an online database. This system is convenient for most. A ToyotaSuper Bowlcommercial that aired on Feb. 13 received tons of media coverage. It featured a blind Paralympian and his brother, who serves as his guide. They have received numerous Paralympic medals. The commercial ends with the words, “Start the journey toward your impossible.” This commercial received endless praise in YouTube comments and in media coverage Inaccessibility runs rampant in our society, and the following are three examples of it. The DCS currently has fluorescent lights, which could be injurious to people withepilepsy,ADHD, and certain forms ofautism. The furniture is all on wheels, which certain administrators were incredibly proud of. People will be able to arrange furniture in whatever way is best for them. However, this constant moving-around of the furniture will be disorienting and dangerous for me and for other blind people. These are both things that I and others had mentioned several times before the space opened. This is not a welcoming “community space”. Stanford’s COVID-19 testing system, while beneficial and “easy” for some, is not so easy for the visually impaired. I asked my sighted professor how they would navigate the system as a blind person; they weren’t sure, and upon pondering this thought, their praise of the system instantly waned — they just hadn’t thought about it before. The Toyota commercial had no audio description, and while the general message was clear, the rest was not. Companies spend millions of dollars putting these commercials together, and this one featured blind people. Why did they not, at the very least, add some description to make it accessible to the very people they featured in their commercial? Others should have held them accountable for this blatant hypocrisy. Additionally, by using the phrase, “your impossible,” the commercial implicitly undervalues the impact of society on the “impossible” barriers that disabled individuals face. This perpetuates a false ideal that barriers in society are controllable by the marginalized individual. Maybe they didn’t think about these issues, but they should have. To be clear, I am not criticizing my professor, nor the brothers featured in the Toyota commercial. I think they are all good people. However, I am criticizing the institutions responsible for not upholding the tenets of accessibility. Stanford University claims to be a champion of diversity, a welcoming space for minorities, including the disabled. Yet, despite the tons of financial support I have received, for which I am eternally grateful, I have felt unwelcome and unheard on several occasions, including with regard to the DCS. I cannot complete COVID-19 tests independently, which are essential to my safety and that of others. If I get COVID-19, take a test and then ask someone else for help reading the barcodes, they might catch the virus from me. Why does Stanford — a champion of diversity and accessibility — support a company whose product is inaccessible? Why does Color Genomics, the testing company, produce an inaccessible product? Toyota, an “Equal Opportunity” company, doesn’t even spend the time to make equal opportunity commercials. I have always been a disability advocate, and I always will be. It is a lifestyle, a mission, a privilege, and in some ways, part of my identity. What I have learned from this lifestyle is that any one individual is not enough to make the changes we need. Society is composed of institutions, and we need institutional buy-in to normalize universal accessibility. Accessibility is an afterthought for you, for Stanford, for Toyota, even occasionally for me. I am not perfect. I have posted so many pictures on Facebook without descriptions. My blind friends didn’t know what the pictures were when I posted them, and now, neither do I. When accessibility is a priority “always”, rather than a haphazard “sometimes”, we will all do better. But we need institutions — Stanford, Color Genomics, Toyota, Congress — and so on, to help make that happen. I dream of a world in which I won’t have to ask people what they are watching, or what they have posted on social media. I dream of a day on which I won’t have to publicly call anyone out for inaccessibility in order to get them to remedy it. I dream of a day when I won’t look like the hypercritical bad guy for simply doing my duty as a disability advocate. When will that day come?"
wildcat_arizona_2022_73,"A group of students, some in masks, walk down the sidewalk of the UA Mall. Long before I had a dream school or even a dream major — I had a dream freshman year. I spent much of high school daydreaming of moving into my dorm and waving my parents away happily, just like in the movies. I pictured myself laughing with an influx of new friends in the library and being the mature, independent version of myself I always pined after. It was probably when I spent the first two weeks of freshman year crying every day and begging my parents to let me come home that I realized this perfect vision may have been slightly unrealistic. Coming to terms with these feelings of intense homesickness and lack of preparation felt like grieving some sort of loss. I would find myself scolding this “immature” behavior that didn’t fit this internal narrative of how I had thought I should be adjusting to life at college — as if there is one right way. I told myself that I needed to grow up. That I was acting like a baby and that everyone else was doing just fine. I didn’t know it then, but what I was feeling couldn’t have been less exclusive to me. The class of 2025 went into our freshman year headfirst, each and every one of us trying to break away from the heaviness and isolation of the two years prior. While freshman year is a trying experience for anyone, it’s no secret that the freshman class this year had a larger adjustment to make. According to numbers from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, the total undergraduate enrollment dropped3.1%from the fall of 2020 to the fall of 2021. This number could be explained by different financial situations for many families due to COVID-19, or even just an uptake in trade schools or community colleges. It could also be explained by many of us feeling stunted socially, not ready to take on all of the challenges that come with college. We spent much of our time in the past two years by ourselves, with our families and retreated from large social gatherings. Despite this hardship, many of us grew immensely within this time period — even if it didn’t feel like it. Whether we acquired a new hobby or enjoyed more time with family, we shouldn’t feel like the time was wasted. It was, however, likely spent more isolated and alone than we had ever been in our lives. I reflect on this and feel for the version of myself who felt so much guilt because she didn’t feel ready to begin this new chapter of life. I reflect on this and am comforted by the idea that many more of us struggled this year than we may ever realize. Let’s be proud of ourselves and acknowledge everything that we accomplished. I know that I felt it many times this semester when all I wanted to do was get on a flight back home. It would have been far easier, more comfortable and more familiar. I remember being on the phone with my dad with his exact words being to just “lean into it, Liv.” It’s a simple couple of words that both confused and annoyed me at the time, but almost nine months later I can’t think of advice any more helpful. Lean into it. Lean into the uncomfortable, the unknown and the scary. If there is anything I have learned from freshman year, it would be the value and importance of these tough moments in our lives over the easy ones. As we close in on freshman year, I realize that it has been the first big step into navigating the rest of our lives. Despite these various trials and tribulations, we began our growth into the people we are going to be. Although I wasn’t always the perfectly prepared version of myself I thought I would be, I’m even prouder of the version that I’ve become. You should be, too.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_15,"Every international conflict that has taken place in the past years has prompted the general public to believe that World War III is on the horizon. However, the Russianinvasionof Ukraine has ignited real fear in the minds of the people — both those in the area of conflict as well as those watching the fire burn. The expansion of Russian territory has been aprimary goalof Putin’s leadership in the past, and the close historical ties between Ukraine and Russia indicate that this invasion may have been a long time coming, especially after Russia’s victory with the annexation of Crimea in 2014. The closeness of the languages and protection of culture have been utilized as areasonfor Putin’s choice of aggressive steps; however, Ukraine has been blossoming on its own, indicating that Russia may just have predatory motives. Since the Biden administration has taken a stance, and NATO countries become economically and politically closer, Putin justifies the existence of a threat by viewing the unity of democracies as forms of western expansion. Putin is clearly breaking the terms of the 1994Budapest Memorandum— the treaty between the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan that affirmed the territorial sovereignty and recognition of Ukraine in return for giving up its nuclear weapons, with Russia taking the title of the third most powerful nuclear country from Ukraine. By seizing the area, Putin not only stands togainclearer access to former Soviet territory, but he also has the chance to break any developing European ties the country may have built and increase his own leverage within international negotiations. In turn, the oscillations between the strength of responses are truly hinging upon the way the world is choosing to frame the narrative. As the world is navigating how to react to the hostile situation that is now clearly a war on sovereignty, we are grappling with what it means to have sovereignty over the formation of an opinion. Even though Ukraine is not an official member of NATO, a large majority of nations have been sending them aid in the form of humanitarian resources, welcoming refugees, troops, and most visibly, economic sanctions. However, the West’s actions have not nearly been enough for the support of the nation, as several fringeareashave already been taken over with high casualty rates. The largest risk being taken by the western bloc is the loss of Russian exports, specifically natural gas. And thus, the cost of intervening becomes larger because of the interdependence between the conflicting states. Even with the power of widespread public support, American intervention has been militarily minimal but economically powerful. This hesitance from the Biden administration can be attributed to the shift in the foreign policy after the Afghanistan withdrawal and the necessity to keep a constrained reaction in the wake of a dangerous military confrontation. However, Ukrainebelievesthat the West is not doing enough. Theydemandthat they fulfill the security assurances they provided in previous treaties. While the conflict does morally oblige the other sovereign nations to help aid the country in peril, they do not have any real legal bindings because assurances are not guarantees, and the idea of the UN’sResponsibility to Protectis always something that has wavered under the ground posited by states. When does a crime become so heinous that action must be taken by actors that are not directly in the conflict? Can such a question be answered by empirical data or numerical categories? What crimes can humanity tolerate before it is stripped of its humanity? The notions of what a crime can be and what exactly is seen as a crime are also consistently changing, especially based on how a government wants toframeit for its people. Ukraine does not deserve this passive form of support from the international community. In a panel hosted by UCI that included experts in political science, international relations and sociology, political science professor Dr. Heidi Hardtstatedthat “i t’s important to acknowledge the historic moment that we’re living in.” It is not incomprehensible that western nations are not absolutely willing to put in all of their resources into a conflict that does not directly involve them. In fact, direct confrontation may put their own populations at risk because Russia is a nuclear power and mutually assured destruction is a real risk when superpowers are at war. As the American stance has clearly beendeclaredas pro-Ukraine, this position could be seen as a provocation, even an act of war, from the Russian perspective. But, the truth is that the real Russian perspective is not even visible to the world due to their state-run media’sprominence, discouraging nations from seeing the full impact of the war on the civilians on both sides. Despite global renouncement of the war, there is no clear route out of it. All diplomatic activities have reached a stalemate, with Russia’s impossible demands and Ukraine’s unmoving strength. Even as a cease-fire wasannouncedon March 8, the 13th day of the conflict, fears and threats cannot cease to continue because Russia canthreatento completely cut off Europe from the essential resource of natural gas. They can even choose to increase the price to a point wherein western aid may be forced to back off to ensure that their own civilians can function on a daily basis. And the lack of accountability to another nation or higher international authority may just leave Ukraine without aid. Even though Americans may not be affected by this threat, they may beblamed, as leaders of the western bloc and often representatives of international response. UCI professor Dr. Erin Lockwood, who teaches International Studies 14: Intro to International Relations, expresses similar sentiments regarding the response of the international community. In an interview with the New University, she indicated that all actions, especially economic, have been deliberate and planned. However, there may be no real effect from the implementation of the most extensive rebuttals, since the cost of the war was already “priced in” by Putin before invading the nation. Western governments’ actions will take a long time before they affect any military strategies: “that’s not how sanctions work … the Russian economy is somewhat insulated in the short fund reserve banks, foreign currency .” Even though it may have been predictable what assets of the country may be targeted, the “extensiveness” of the sanctions, including personal funds and banking systems, could not have been anticipated. Lockwood also believes that it is early and difficult to predict whether the “economic toll can generate sufficient domestic unrest that might matter to Putin’s decision calculations.” The space for domestic voices is highly constrained in Russia; thus, this scenario in which the Russian populace’s concerns overtake Putin’s territorial sights is highly unlikely, especially based on theincreasingarrests of protestors. The ease of the fabrication of images, the scams spewing up for fake aid and creation of false testimonies create a tumultuous space for misinformation and impact public organization. As the war continues to move to the west, it is important to remember that sanctions are ultimately longer-term “punishments” whose real effect can and will be overstepped by the previously planned precautions. Lockwood agrees that this age of social media, even as it “gives ordinary people a voice and outsiders a glimpse into the lives of everyday Ukrainians,” may pose multiple risks to victims unknowingly being circulated on the internet. She stated that caution is necessary when sharing these narratives and stories from personal platforms while acknowledging that it is truly a double-edged sword. Biases matter and they always have. In fact, what is being discussed right now is definitely biased because it comes from the perspective of a student living outside the conflict, whose political views may not match those of diplomats. In this case, many of the biases are manufacturing ideas that help further their own agendas; it depends on what a person chooses to follow, fact-check and count on. For those that have been following the war with information limited to the public sphere, desensitization to the real impact of conflict is rampant. The largest humanitarian and refugee crisis is currently ongoing, and many may choose to usememesto understand the scope. But, this is one of the first times that a war in a truly new format is unfolding and emerging in front of the general populations’ eyes. This desensitization may indicate alack of compassionand even, in the long run, a shorter attention span that would endanger victims. When people move on to the next scarier thing, then what? Do we stop advocating for the people in need once the war is no longer trending? We saw this happen with the pandemic as people eventually tired of newer guidelines and chose to stop planning ahead despite the pandemic still raging on in underprivileged communities. The perspective being given to us is a product of years of behind-the-scenes work by those in authority, and we have no say in the perspectives we consume. Our voices may truly have no effect on the real puppet masters of public opinion at the end of the day. Despite the growing fears in popular culture, there isn’t actually an oncoming World War III or new Cold War. In an interview with the New University, Lockwood expressed her belief that even though there are several plausible comparisons to draw to the Cold War, with a neo-imperialist Russia looking to expand, we are in a “different world.” And that is because there are new roles of power in the international system, such as China, that are playing into its own territorial dilemma by aiding Ukraine while staying friendly with Russia. She also mentioned that Russia’s shift from communism to authoritarianism has removed the ideological aspect of the Cold War that had heightened the tensions. So what are we scared of now? The primary answer is nuclear risk. However, contemporary economic interdependence still has the power to supersede those chaotic destructions and even give a chance for reconciliation. Many depend on Russia for natural gas, and many depend on Ukraine for agricultural exports. With the need for these essential resources, is the world truly willing to risk an oppressive takeover, a puppet government and a humanitarian crisis? Currently, each perspective — whether artificial or real — points to the necessity of rational actions that do not risk humanity’s prosperity, which has begun to slowly rise after a health crisis.Nandini Sharma is an Opinion Staff Writer.

crimson_2022_148,"When I recall the nation I was born in, my memories of the brief time I spent there are conjured through rose-tinted glasses. I recall lush fields of green rice paddies, ponds decorated with lily pads and frogs, and trees bursting with fruit. Besides myself, Bangladesh is home to 168 million people — yet the nation was only recently born through blood and struggle over 50 years ago. Now, Bangladesh faces great struggle again. The majority of the nation sits on the largest river delta in the world, at the confluence of the mighty Ganges, Jamuna, and Meghna Rivers. These rivers are Bangladesh’s lifeblood; they are the waterways that produce the rich agricultural soil that dubs the nation the “Land of Rivers.” My rose-tinted glasses are gone now. Where there were once rice paddies, there is now just water; where there were once ponds full of life, they are now buried under the currents; and where there was once beautiful agriculture, there is now only erosion and destruction. The Land of Rivers is quickly becoming the sea, and no one is coming to save it. Two-thirds of Bangladesh sits at less than 15 feet above sea level. By 2050, one in seven people in Bangladesh will be displaced by climate change. This past summer, catastrophic flash floods — the worst in Bangladesh in over a hundred years — barreled through the northeastern region of Sylhet, wiping away towns and affecting around 7.2 million people. Bangladesh is accustomed to torrential downpours during monsoon seasons — yet the globe’s warming climate is quickly lengthening and intensifying the rains and floods, permanently altering the nation’s landscape. Nearly 75 percent of Bangladesh sits below sea level. Erosion from the Padma, Jamuna, and Meghna has engulfed 160,000 hectares of land, pushing 300,000 to 400,000 people each year to flee to Dhaka, the country’s capital. Bangladesh, like many coastal nations, is ground zero for climate change, unjustly bearing the brunt of wealthy nations’ carbon emissions. Despite producing a mere 0.21 percent of global CO2 — leagues below China with 29.2 percent, the U.S. with 14 percent, and Japan with 3.5 percent — Bangladesh is paying the price for these nations in its own lands and livelihoods in what may only be considered an extreme climate injustice. For wealthier nations, the luxuries of everyday life allow climate change to loom in the distant future. But for Bangladesh, and other nations such as Pakistan, climate change has already claimed the lives of their people, destroyed their homes, and created life-altering cycles of poverty. This year, unprecedented flooding submerged 94 percent of Bangladesh’s Sunamganj town and 84 percent of the surrounding Sylhet district — flooding so terrible it has never been seen in living memory. My people are resilient and uniquely poised totacklethe issue of climate change with innovative solutions. However, they should not have to face this fight alone while we watch their nation sink from our dry vantage spots in Cambridge. Harvard, with its multibillion-dollar endowment, should publicly address and invest in resources for Bangladeshi flood relief. For Pakistan, student activists from Harvard College Pakistani Students Association have alreadyrisen to the fightby raising funds among students; Harvard should provide monetary support for and amplify these voices. Academia is not apolitical. Harvard has been an architect and endorser of harmful policy and practice. Divestment from fossil fuels, while monumental and significant, was not the clean-cut end of Harvard’s muddy relationship with climate change — not while nations like Bangladesh and Pakistan still reap the effects of decades of fossil fuel pollution. Harvard’s student body is undeniably conscious of the climate crisis and humanitarian crises such as the one in Ukraine — and rightfully so. However, there is a clear bias in whom we choose to show solidarity to. Choosing to center victims who are white is a reflection of Western notions of humanity, and a broader symptom of a Western tendency to disregard Black and Brown bodies in favor of serving the West’s geopolitical interests. I have a personal confession to make: I cannot swim. This is an oddity for someone born in a tropical country. Back home, my grandmother insisted on carrying all her grandchildren into the ponds, until each child learned the useful life skill of a butterfly or backstroke — all except for me. Instead, I was whisked away to this land, where I have comfortably lived without ever needing to know how to swim. I still don’t know how to swim. It’s a forgivable privilege here. Students at Harvard swim for fun, to exercise, or in races against other schools — but not to scramble away from the waves consuming their home. Knowing how to swim is not an option for the people of Bangladesh, who must swim for their lives, away from lands wrecked by our ignorance.

stanforddaily_2022_116,"Specific policies that colleges use in their admissions processes, like legacy and athlete admissions, have been proven to disproportionately aid the rich and white in their college search. The inequality these policies perpetuate, however, is baked into the fundamentals of college applications: standardized tests and holistic admissions. Standardized tests have proven time and time again to be a “wealth test,” as opposed to one of intelligence. Operation Varsity Blues introduced to the general public the idea of rich parents exploiting extra-time accommodations and paying individuals to correct their children’s scores during the test (but really, how surprised were we, when this very situation was the plot of one of the first episodes of“Gossip Girl”? . But aside from actual illegal cheating, theACT reported in 2016that students whose parents earn $80,000 or higher score a 23.6 on average, while those with less wealthy parents typically scored a 19.5. Stanford’s average ACT scoresrange from 32 to 35, which, based on test scores alone, would seem to push the economic demographic of the University even further away from the nation’s average. And the overlap between wealth and test scores is impacted by race:as of 2016, white families had a median family wealth of $171,000, while those numbers for Black and Hispanic families fall at $17,600 and $20,700, respectively. The median, of course, does not represent these racial demographics in their entirety, but the intersection of race and wealth certainly seems to impact test results. And the very process created to combat this phenomenon — holistic admissions — upholds it just as much. Colleges have become exponentially more selective over time.Since the 1970s, the number of college applicants has doubled. Universities, however, have largely remained the same size. To ensure their children stood out against these new and large waves of applicants, families turned to extracurricular activities to round out their children’s applications. The 1990s saw a significant rise in the amount of time parents, especially college-educated parents, spent on childcare (that is, time parents spend with their progeny under 18 at the same time that the United States saw a dramatic increase in the size of college-aged cohorts.Garey and Valerie Rameyat the Brookings Institute studied this phenomenon and connected the two figures, finding that these parents’ care specifically targeted older children, and consisted mainly of travel and activities — categories that look favorable on a college application. The study also found that an increase of a cultural emphasis placed on “prestige” motivated parents to spend more time on childcare. Indeed, selective (read: prestigious universitiesput the most emphasis on extracurricular involvementon the admissions process. Ultimately, college-educated parents — who by and large already have a monetary and social advantage in preparing their children for college — exploit this advantage and dedicate more time to the childcare they believe will get their children into selective universities. This increased competition, which has led to more time spent on college-prep activities, has resulted in a rise of qualified applicants. As students attempted to outperform each other to impress colleges’ emerging interest in extracurricular activities instead of solely academics, all the once-exceptional applicants began to look alike. Colleges implemented “holistic admissions,” a system that promised to evaluate applicants on their character, not just their academic merit, to individualize the process once more. This system, however, leaves room for even more bias in the admissions process. According to theCollege Board’s guide to holistic admissions, colleges consider mission-statement alignment, an applicant’s ability to thrive at and enrich a school, as well as the academic, nonacademic and contextual factors of an applicant. The College Board pushes this policy, and colleges have adopted it, because it allows applicants to explain any extenuating circumstances that could make an otherwise qualified applicant perform worse than her or his peers. A 2013 videoobserving Amherst College’s admissions committee, however, shows how personal bias can inform these decisions. Tom Parker, a dean of admissions, concedes that “there are times, honestly, where I’m not sure why I put my hand up or failed to put my hand up” to decide whether or not to admit a student. This frightening ambiguity pushes students to adopt the latest hobbies they think admissions officers want to see, which undermines the “authenticity” that holistic admissions strives to capture. In his article“The Abiding Scandal of College Admissions,”Matt Feeney sums up this paradox: “It’s like watching Meryl Streep portray Margaret Thatcher and thinking, Now that is the real Meryl Streep.” Holistic admissions takes on a perverse life of its own when considered from a student’s perspective. Starting as young as middle school, students begin to craft a caricature of themselves they believe will appeal to colleges, which then breeds the question: Where does the college applicant end and the kid begin? Colleges have convinced students that their admissions decision is a moral judgement on their very person. And this engine that was created to equalize the playing field ultimately still favors the rich and white: students with money have more opportunities to create an “authentic” profile. In addition, 85% ofa 2016 surveyof 559 chief admissions officers identified as white, and to them,as Matt Feeney put it, “what ends up resembling ‘authenticity’ … is an uncannily WASPy mix of dispensations.” Standardized college admissions testing was created as a supposedly objective metric to measure potential students’ academic merit. When this system failed to uphold the meritocratic values it preached, colleges turned to holistic admissions to fill in the gaps. But without governmental policy at the local, state and national levels that addresses American wealth disparity, and especially the intersection between income and race, these metrics of admissions will fail to uphold any semblance of meritocracy in American universities. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated “white families had a median income of $171,000, while those numbers for Black and Hispanic families fall at $17,600 and $20,700, respectively.” The statement has been corrected to indicate that these figures refer to median family wealth, not income.

rice_thresher_2022_32,"ByDylan Glenn5/12/22 4:05pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. I would like to preface this piece with this understanding: This opinion in no way discourages students from seeking help for poor mental health. Students should not hesitate to reach out to any available professionals for routine mental health services or mental health emergencies. Before you attend a counseling session at the Rice counseling center, you will be told that “the RCC maintains strict standards regarding privacy.” You will find statements from the university that your mental health record will not be shared withanyoneoutside of extreme situations of imminent harm, and only then thatyour information will be shared with only the necessary officials.This sounds great, except that these assurances bear no teeth whatsoever — no enforcement agency ensures that Rice follows its public confidentiality promises, and there are no penalties for Rice if they break them. The Wellbeing and Counseling Centers should more directly communicate the limits of their confidentiality policies when compared to unaffiliated counseling centers, and students in sensitive situations should take the necessary precautions to protect their information. I was not aware of this, and learned the hard way. During a scheduled session with a therapist at the Rice Counseling Center in fall of 2021, I tentatively divulged a number of concerning trends that warranted a visit to the emergency room. I only shared this information because the wellbeing and counseling centers had led me to believe that my words were confidential — between only me and my healthcare professionals. My therapist directly assured me that even my emergency contact would not be privileged to my information, and I proceeded voluntarily with the hospital admission confident in their confidentiality promises. I went to the hospital expecting to stay a few hours. I remained there for six days. On the third day, I received an unsettling call from my sister. Rice had not only spoken with my mother — who was my emergency contact — but they had told her everything I had said to my counselor, including false details that greatly exaggerated the severity of my situation. My mother was the last person I wanted someone else to tell the words I had said in the privacy of a counseling center, and I had prepared to inform my parents of my situation in my own time. At my most vulnerable moment, the Wellbeing Center had become the single largest obstacle to my mental well-being. After six months of reading regulations, emailing Rice officials and speaking with the federal Student Privacy Policy Office, I have uncovered an unsettling reality: legally enforced confidentiality does not exist at universities, at least between most students and their parents. University counseling centers are governed by FERPA — the privacy standard for academic records — and are inherently less confidential than unaffiliated counseling centers, which are protected by HIPAA. The text of FERPA does seemingly offer special protections for mental health records, but thebizarre interpretation of the lawtaken by the Department of Education lumps treatment records together with education records, making psychological assessments subject to the same federal disclosure allowances as your grade in COMP 140. Under FERPA, nothing prevents Rice from sharing the totality of your mental health record with your parentsif they claim you as a tax dependent, or if Rice decides that full disclosure isnecessary for your health and safety(even if it objectively is not . It does not matter what assurances you are given from a university — FERPA allows non-consensual disclosure. While FERPA does broadly allow universities to disclose sensitive information, it never mandates that they do so. As a barrier between your sensitive records and unlimited release to your parents stands the Rice Counseling Center’sconfidentiality policies, which seemingly offer confidentiality protections comparable to those of HIPAA-protected counseling centers. Nothing in these publicly available policies allows the non-consensual disclosure of information to anyone other than mental health professionals, emergency or not. Assuming Rice adheres to its own policies, strong confidentiality exists. Rice, as it happens, does not need to adhere to its policies — no one makes them. No outside agency holds universities accountable to their own confidentiality guidelines, leaving Rice as the sole legislator, executor, and judge of its health record policies. Such a system simply cannot guarantee strong confidentiality. Officials from the Wellbeing Center and Dean’s office have told me that the disclosure of my information was warranted because my situation constituted an emergency. This justification is as absurd as it is depressing. Rules and agreements do not cease to exist simply because someone labels the situation an ‘emergency.’ Mental health emergencies are the very instances when confidentiality ismostimportant because it is when students are at their most vulnerable. If confidentiality exists in all casesexceptwhen it becomes inconvenient, then it never existed at all. There are some steps you can take to try and avoid a full disclosure to your parents in cases where hospitalization is the best path forward. The Counseling Center is not out to hurt you, but you need to make your requests very clear. First, you can ask to change your emergency contact before you leave for the hospital. If your emergency contact is someone other than your parent, Rice cannot legally share records with them without consent. You should also make it clear to your therapist that you do not want your parents to know the details of your record, and make sure that they pass this request on to the Wellbeing Center. Put the request in writing if you can. Finally, ask to review the paperwork filled out by your counselor to ensure that they provided an accurate account of your circumstances. At the end of the day, a significant portion of the problem lies with the U.S. Student Privacy Policy Office, who, in my opinion, egregiously misinterprets FERPA in a way that erases privacy protections written into the law. While the Wellbeing Center cannot change the way federal agencies interpret law, they can improve their own policies. The Wellbeing and Counseling Centers should be forthright with students about the lack of full confidentiality enjoyed by other, unaffiliated centers. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_36,"While most of our student body was busy working during Indigenous People’s Day, a gathering of over a 100 people celebrated with speeches, dances, and activities. However, this joyous occasion is darked by Harvard’s continued delay in returning Indigenous sacred artifacts and remains that reside across the institution. Earlier this year, Harvard’s role in slavery and colonialism boiled to the surface with the release of the 2022 Harvard and The Legacy of Slavery Report. While the publication of the report was certainly a positive step towards rectification, it must be supplemented by an active commitment by students, professors and Harvard affiliates to ensure real change occurs at all levels of the institution. This commitment includes following the United States Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which requires the federal government and federally funded institutions to return Indigenous sacred objects, funerary objects, and human remains. Under the original act, institutions had until 1995 to catalog and return any and all objects that fell within the criteria. Yet, 27 years after the inventory’s deadline, the Legacy of Slavery Report states that at least 6,400 Indigenous remains reside at Harvard, along with some 13,600 sacred and funerary objects that aren’t affiliated with any specific tribe, according to federal NAGPRA databases. It is therefore clear that the NAGPRA Act is not being enforced effectively at many federally funded institutions — Harvard included. Numerous Indigenous leaders have called out Harvard for the prolonged delay in the return of these remains and artifacts. Many federally funded institutions continue to draw out the lineage process of Indigenous sacred artifacts and remains, despite NAGPRA explicitly stating that in cases of unidentifiable remains and items, the pertinent stakeholders must return them to tribes from the Native lands from which the artifacts and remains were originally taken. This June, following the leak of an unfinalised version of the University report, the CEO of the Association of American Indian Affairs, Shannon O’Loughlin, expressed that the process of identifying the appropriate destination for remains was “not a scientific investigation,” and called on the University to follow the law that explicitly states that “no additional research is necessary” and that “the museum is supposed to use information it already has and consult with tribes” before conducting unnecessary, delay-ridden research. Likewise, in 2021, the Association of American Indian Affairs explicitly stated in a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow that “you have significantly more deceased Native people in boxes on your campus than the number of live Native students that you allow to attend your institution,” a mathematical certainty. When Ancestors cannot be buried and sacred items are not returned, long-established trends of America’s colonial history of ‘othering’ Native populations and their traditions are reproduced, whether intended or not. Despite Harvard’s promise to reckon with its legacy of slavery and colonialism, affiliates across the institution have expressed that there is not a strong commitment to acting with efficiency, as demonstrated through the delayed completion of the NAGPRA guidelines for 27 years. Although Harvard created a Human Remains Returns Committee in September 2022, it is unclear whether this would speed up the process or purely provide another bureaucratic hoop to jump through. Throughout academia there is a long history of institutional forces being intertwined with white supremacist agendas. Therefore, in the creation of this committee, the potential influence of institutional forces that may inherently undermine the committee’s progress must be taken into account. A committee of this nature should exist at our institution in the effort of repatriation, but a major issue facing this committee would be that the governing body and investigating party are one and the same. There needs to be a third-party, independent committee that ensures the University is abiding by NAGPRA. It is important to acknowledge that implementing NAGPRA is a widespread problem across universities, museums, and other federally funded institutions. Reclaiming artifacts is a lengthy and often expensive process for various Indigenous communities in the United States. As repatriation request processes differ from institution to institution, there is no uniform waiting period for communities receiving their rightful property. Some schools, like Harvard, have struggled in parting with history, leading to delayed repatriation. However, others have recently moved forward the communal effort of returning remains and sacred items. During the period from August 2020 to August 2021, UC Berkeley “transferred at least 297 individuals and 15,792 of their belongings back to tribes.” Similarly, earlier this year Vassar College completed its return of all Indigenous artifacts in their archaeological collections. These schools follow the lead of others like UNC Chapel Hill and Stanford, among others, in the rightful return of stolen items and remains. These universities prove that prompt, careful attention to detail of Indigenous artifacts is possible if the commitment to doing so is sincere and devoted enough institutional resources. Harvard’s decisions and actions in the following months will demonstrate its sincerity — or lack thereof — to repatriate Indigenous remains and sacred artifacts. Harvard’s recent pledge to return the hair samples taken from Native American children in Peabody Museum to the rightful tribes is a positive act, but it is not enough. The wellbeing and success of Indigenous students currently at Harvard must be prioritized as well. As Ph.D. candidate in Harvard’s History Department Anthony M. Trujillo,expressedin The Crimson, “this university just can’t ignore Indigenous life, thought, creativity, if it wants to be a leading institution in the next years and decades, centuries to come.” Returning the hair samples, in addition to the remainder of Indigenous remains currently in the University’s possession, cannot be the end all of Harvard’s commitment to its Indigeneous affiliates. More action must be taken to support and center Indigenous voices as well. This lack of creativity in finding solutions hampers everyone and we, as Harvard students, need to decide what kind of institution we want to cultivate. As Harvard continues to drag its feet, it is up to us, both Indigenous people and allies, to amplify the voices of our Indigenous classmates. Speak out against the injustices and violence that continues against Indigenous communities as time passes by. If we commit to shining a constant spotlight on Harvard’s moral hypocrisy in returning property to Indigenous communities, especially given the broader context of Harvard’s Legacy of Slavery Report, then there is a great possibility for change and transparency across the institution.

thetech_mit_2022_13,"In November 2021, as the world watched, delegates from United Nations countries met in Glasgow for theCOP26 conferenceon climate change in an attempt to limit the global temperature increase to no more than 1.5ºC above pre-Industrial Revolution levels. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is increasingly urgent, and fossil fuel companies’ role in perpetuating the climate crisis is crystal clear. However, until the behavior of fossil fuel companies changes, meaningful progress towards combating climate change will remain impossible. The agreement to emerge from COP26 explicitly addressed fossil fuels — unfortunatelya first for a climate accord. But even at the very event where this pledge was finally made, the fossil fuel industry sent so many representatives that theyoutnumbered the delegates from any single country. It is no coincidence that over the course of COP26, the language was watered down between drafts, going from calling for an end toallfossil fuel subsidies to only phasing out inefficient ones. Action to reduce our dependence on polluting energy sources has been too little, too late, with fossil fuel companies blocking much progress. Organizers in the divestment movement seek to address one facet of this issue by removing investments in the fossil fuel industry. Together as the MIT community, we can make the statement that not only are the harmful actions of fossil fuel companies morally inexcusable, and out of line with the urgently necessary global transition to clean energy, they’re simply abad investment. As more organizations divest, societal pressure against the bad practices of fossil fuel companies is growing, helping to drive the widespread adoption of sustainable energy sources. At the forefront of the divestment movement are colleges and universities, including many peers of MIT. In the Boston area,Harvardpledged to divest from fossil fuels Sept. 9, followed shortly byBoston UniversitySept. 23. Oct. 8,Dartmouthpledged to divest, making it the fifth of eight Ivy League schools to take this important step. Yet as this list continues to grow, where is MIT — a technological leader of the world, a school committed to science and knowledge, and an institution supposedly committed to combating climate change? In truth, MIT’s current level of response to the climate crisis is inadequate and disappointing compared to the scope of the problem. Nothing short of full divestment and a commitment to pursuing green, equitable energy research would be appropriate. Instead, on the financial side, MIT’s Investment Management Company (MITIMCo has released a lackluster“Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG Investment Framework.”MITIMCo prides itself on making investment decisions “based on our knowledge of MIT’s values and the guidance we receive from the Institute’s leadership and governance” but continues to invest in the fossil fuel industry.The Draft Report of the MIT Values Statement Committeeoffered “Mind, Hand, Heart” as MIT’s motto; surely, investing in an industry known to pollute our planet and lie about its actions, simply to continue profiting off existing infrastructure, is antithetical to those principles. As fossil fuel companies continue to benefit from investors like MIT and enable the disasters that result from climate change, they continue to inflict harm around the globe. One counter-argument offered against the prospect of full divestment is that the investments are outside of MITIMCo’s control: they only choose the investment managers, not the ultimate destination of the money. However, this claim does not hold up to scrutiny, since other institutions with similar investment structures as MIT, such asRutgers,George Washington University, andCambridge University, have divested. In addition, MIT still has leverage to control which investment managers they hire — and they have a large pool from which to choose. In the past 12 months,MIT received cold emails from 1,800 prospective managers. It is inconceivable that none held values aligned with promoting investment into green energy over fossil fuels. In the 2021 fiscal year, MIT’s endowment experiencedan unprecedented 64% increasein its unrestricted funds category, which much of its fossil fuel investment money comes from. There is a choice the Institute must make about where to put those new funds: into destructive fossil-fuel investments, or into industries and activities that support humanity’s future. Even MIT’s direct response to climate change, in the form of the newClimate Action Plan(CAP , is disappointing and ineffective. Despite the CAP’s strong rhetoric and broad scope of goals, the lack of any aggressive action and measurable accountability is marked. If MIT’s mission really is to “go as far as we can, as fast as we can,” why do we continue to engage with the industry that has led humanity into this predicament and shown no intentions of changing its toxic behavior? Instead of being a technological and political leader to change the tide of climate change, MIT has once again shown that the institution prioritizes the status quo over meaningful change. There’s no better time to act than now. As the world races to minimize the catastrophic damage that will be inescapable to future generations if nothing is done, MIT must use every tool at its disposal to aid in the fight against climate change.The majority of MIT’s student body,the Undergraduate Association, andthe majority of MIT facultysupport divestment. Other community representatives have endorsed divestment, including theCambridge City Council in a unanimous resolution, and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has backed the idea and signedan ordinance to divest city investments. As MIT holds onto its increasingly unprofitable fossil fuel investments, those same companies continue to spew out greenhouse gases, sending us all spiraling towards a worse and worse future. MIT is a leading technical institution primarily because of the brilliant faculty members and students who have come here withan appetite for solving the hardest problems, in service to society.Climate change may be a hard problem to solve, but it is nonetheless a problem that our institution can help rectify in an effective and equitable manner. It is time for MIT to put its money where its mouth is and divest from the fossil fuel industry now."
crimson_2022_133,"Congratulations on your graduation! We have been privileged to work alongside you as your instructors and collaborators over the last several years. We have witnessed firsthand your intelligence, perseverance, and integrity, and we are filled with pride at your accomplishments. During your time at Harvard, and this year especially, the University has been rocked by several public cases of sexual misconduct. We are among the many who have been affected by these abuses. We write to you today to share some lessons we have learned while struggling to navigate these harms. We have seen how challenging it can be to merely discuss abuses of power, let alone address them. This can be especially difficult when harm is perpetrated by someone with a responsibility for doing good or the power to determine the fates of others — like a religious leader, professor, coach, doctor, or family member. It can feel like whole worlds ride on these conflicts — and indeed they often do: Whole selves, families, communities, and institutions may have to be reorganized for the truth of such harm to be acknowledged and addressed. Powerful institutions especially fight being remade in this way, because part of what enables them to survive over time is resistance to public truths that would require their transformation, oversight, or even their obsolescence. But our worlds are not so brittle that they cannot be remade. And so our first piece of advice for you concerns how to live with an ordinary and painful truth — that we all know and love people who have done harmful things, and we all know and love people who have been harmed. Throughout our lives, each of us will have times when we are surprised by the depth of our own mistakes and by the cruelty of the people we love. Each of us will also have times when we are surprised by our own bravery and integrity, and by the bravery and integrity of others. We urge you to embrace such revelations, and not to turn away from the complexities and contradictions they may evince. Confronting these truths will give you humility and compassion as you go forward. We can all cultivate skills of public truth-telling and accountability that can bring our communities into greater safety and knowledge: Practice talking with real and great specificity about the details of life. Be comfortable challenging others and being challenged. Learn to apologize well when you hurt others, and proactively look for ways to enact repair. Find the people who will tell you the truth and help you grow. Our second piece of advice is this: When you stand at a juncture at which you have the choice to address harm or ignore it, we encourage you to think and act on broader timescales of humanity and history, rather than on timescales of your own success or failure. What we have learned in our time at Harvard is that you will rarely get to choose which struggles you are a part of, or what happens as a result of engaging with them — but you can do your best to observe carefully and respond with courage. Those of you graduating will have already seen years of active struggle to address injustices perpetuated within and by the institution that is Harvard University. You have seen the first strikes by unionized student workers in Harvard’s history. Your own advocacy, capping off years of concerted organizing, has resulted in Harvard’s divestment from fossil fuels. Yet Harvard has made no similar commitment regarding its profits from private prisons and prison-serving companies. Harvard has not returned to Tamara Lanier the photos it holds of her enslaved kin Renty and Delia, which are the spoils of theft. Sexual violence remains rampant across our campus. Fifty years after Title IX’s passage sought to protect students from sex discrimination in education,our lawsuitcontends that those civil rights — like so many others — remain unfulfilled. We never expected to file a lawsuit during our time in graduate school. But our experiences transformed what our work would have to be. As you move on to other places and continue to think about the nature of institutions, of influence, and of power, celebrate the transformative work that succeeds. And have the courage to support the work that cannot be successful yet because it is asking for things power and norms will not yet allow. That a change is adamantly resisted by those in power is all the more reason to take notice, to listen carefully, and most of all, to insist on a more fair and just world. As aletterwritten by our peers states, even when a desired change has not yet come about, “the refusal to give or take scraps is world-making in other ways.” Remember that your careful everyday work matters, and it will always touch other lives, whether now or in the future world you are building. Remember too that all meaningful work is slow, and you will need plenty of rest, laughter, and shared meals to keep going. Each of you deserves joy and justice. We can’t wait to see where you find it. Margaret G. Czerwienski, Lilia M. Kilburn, and Amulya Mandava are graduate students in Harvard’s Anthropology Department and plaintiffs of an ongoing lawsuit against Harvard University."
state_press_2022_46,"Loan forgiveness can help level the playing field so that higher education is not just for those who grew up wealthy. The Biden-Harris administration sstudent debt relief plancontinues to bounce in and out of courts around the country as critics question if the program is fair. After taking a closer look at who this program affects and how it will work, it is clear the student loan debt relief program is an important step toward increasing access to higher education and providing resources for lower-income students. Although the program seems to be an intuitively constructive resource, it has faced major backlash. In September, after the executive order was announced, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich filed alawsuitagainst the Biden administration claiming the order was unconstitutional and fundamentally unfair. READ MORE:AG Mark Brnovich files lawsuit to block federal student loan cancellation On Thursday,a Texas federal judge struck downthe forgiveness plan, writing in a 26-page opinion it did not go through the proper regulatory processes. The Biden administration can appeal the ruling. For some reason, it is hard for certain lawmakers to comprehend helping the generation after they gain more resources and assistance than they had. Georgia s Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is one of the strong opponents of the program, and has called the plan completely unfair, as she believes that taxpayers will have to cover the costs of students who piled up massive debt going to some ivy league school. What these lawmakers do not have in mind is the excessive costs for low-income students, even at public universities like ASU. Fourth-year nursing student andPell Grantrecipient Gabi Campbell said she took out $26,000 worth of loans, even with financial aid and scholarships. The Biden administration s debt relief program will help alleviate the stress that can accompany taking out these loans. I was always nervous that when I graduate, I will solely be working to pay off my loans, but now I really no longer have that fear, Campbell said. She also discussed how the loan forgiveness plan affects her differently as a Pell Grant recipient, as the plan grants more relief for students in more financial need. The Pell Grant awards aid to undergraduate students with significant financial aid needs while they complete their first bachelor s degree. I think this will be a great thing for students, and (I hope college will become more accessible to low-income students, Campbell said. As the cost of four-year college has tripled in the past 40 years, the maximum amount of Pell Grant values has stayed relatively the same since 1980. Higher education, in this sense, is becoming increasingly inaccessible to low-income students. Loan forgiveness can help level the playing field so that higher education is not just for those who grew up wealthy. Many other countries, including Canada, Sweden, England and Germany offer some form of debt relief and/or tuition-free college for all residents. Even in countries like France, where students do pay tuition, the costs are significantly less than that of American students, allowing many French students to graduate debt-free. This also leads to people of different economic backgrounds holding university degrees. There is no downside to having a more educated, well-rounded populace by maximizing the number of citizens able to attend higher education. The student debt relief plan is a great first step in working towards assisting those who would like the opportunity for higher education. According to aCNBC report, more than 80% of student loan borrowers ages 22 to 35 in the U.S. state their educational loans as the reason they have not bought a house yet. In addition to this, student loan debt can cause significant mental distress for years after college, leading to high numbers of suicide ideation in borrowers. A2021 surveyindicated one in 14 borrowers had experienced suicidal ideation in response to the stress of student loans. Student loan debt in the U.S. is a crisis that must be addressed. The Biden-Harris administration s student debt relief plan is a step in the right direction for prioritizing education and students in the U.S. As other countries have shown, universal college and loan forgiveness increases the accessibility of higher education and relieves the economic stress of attending college. There is no reason to think that positive change for some groups entails negative consequences for others. The debt relief program provides many students with resources that prove to be useful in their college years and for years to come.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_39,"“Zoey 101” actress Jamie Lynn Spears recentlyappeared on “Good Morning America” for asit-down interviewwith journalist Juju Chang where she discussed her recently published memoir, “Things I Should Have Said,” difficult family dynamics and the pressure of carrying her last name.In the interview, Spears addressed her father’s alcoholism, her admiration for her big sister and the infamous conservatorship singer Britney Spears was recently released from after 13 years. Prior to the end of her conservatorship, Britney Spearstestified in courtreferring to the matter as “abusive” and traumatizing. “I’ve been in shock. I am traumatized … And I would honestly like to sue my family, to be totally honest with you,” Britney Spears stated. Britney Spears responded to her younger sister’s television appearance with a statement onTwitter, where she clarified her disparaging comments towards Jamie Spears and emphasized the unfair and different treatment the two sisters received from their parents — with Britney Spears experiencing the most pressure. Britney Spears later shared her shock at her sister’s claims and accused her of fabricating lies “When I said only a scum person would make things like that about someone, I could have sworn I said ‘but you’re not’… but it doesn’t make sense at all to me what you are saying!!!” Brtiney Spearstweeted. It can seem entertaining to witness two famous siblings airing their conflicts to the public in the media, such as theKardashiansisters fighting on their reality show orChristopher Cicconewriting about his sister Madonna in his memoir “Life with My Sister Madonna.” However, a question that seems to rise in the heated Spears sibling exchange is: should they handle this matter privately? With thepublic backlashagainst Jamie Spears, it seems logical that this matter should have been dealt with behind closed doors. In response, Jamie Spears said that she “can’t help” that she was“born a Spears too.” Jamie Spears has the right to air out her grievances because she was raised under the spotlight of her sister’s superstardom, and is a known celebrity in her own right. This sibling conflict would have inevitably been covered by the press somewhere down the line. Additionally, the possibility of false stories fabricated by the media in order to increase tensions between the two celebrity sisters and generate profits and views could have influenced her decision. Similar circumstances have occurred in the past withcelebrity death hoaxesandfake celebrity storieson Facebook search results. The thought of tabloids “stirring the pot” on the current drama unfolding between these high-profile celebrity siblings does not seem so far-fetched at all. Although the idea of being famous can seem promising to some — the large profits, loving fans and a multitude of opportunities — the price of giving up privacy and personal life seems too damaging. When someone is famous, it is often difficult for their personal lives to be private. Their lives are constantly being viewed under a microscope with fans, paparazzi and even possible stalkers being able to see their every move and personal issues on the internet. BritneySpears’sown personal experiences with the paparazzi, andstalkers who terrorize celebrities, are just two examples of how diffcult it can be for famous individuals to live normal lives on a day-to-day basis. While some celebrities such asAndrew Garfielddecide to keep their personal lives private in order to retain the “right to be ordinary,” others likeKim Kardashianhave previously stated that they “so wanted the attention” of being famous in the past. Fame is a double edged sword — would the price of fame even be worth it if it means your private life would cease to exist? Despite the great perks of being a celebrity, a person’s personal and professional life would inevitably merge into one while living in the public eye. As a result, it seems inevitable that the issues between both Spears sisters would have been brought to light and speculated upon whether or not Jamie Spears wrote her memoir. It’s hard to blame her. She is entitled to her opinion and deserves to share her experiences and issues with the public, even if there are others who have negative things to say about it. However, the way she is doing so is inappropriate. Although it may seem logical that she would air her problems about her experiences and issues with her family, she still could have discussed these personal matters with them privately. Spears’sexplanationultimately being she “can’t help” that she was “born a Spears too” still does not account for her inability to discuss her issues with her family thoroughly prior to her book’s publication. Looking at the currentpublic response, it seems unlikely that Jamie Spears discussed these issues with her family prior to her memoir’s release and possible that she did not. Although Jamie Spears deserves to share and explain the details of her life experiences and problems to the world, she should have resolved this matter privately. Of course, she is a celebrity, and without a doubt there could have been tabloids and paparazzi stalking and invading her and Britney Spears’s privacy down the line in order to get the “juiciest,” most-profitable story of sibling and family issues. However, she is a person first, and like any other normal person, she could have easily tried to resolve her issues and concerns with her sister or her parents first if she really wanted to. Instead, she decided to publish a book about her family’s issues and sell it for profit — all while gaining publicity that she may or may not have wanted in the first place — making her family dynamic arguably even worse.Eric Mena is an Opinion Intern for the 2022 winter quarter.

crimson_2022_61,"Earlier this month, what the National Weather Service deemed a bomb cyclone downed about two and half feet of snow in Massachusetts and other parts of the Northeast. At Harvard, people made snowmen, stood on a frozen Charles river, and basked in what The Crimsoncalleda “foot of icy fun.” I broke one of the bones in my feet jumping over a particularly large puddle. Not yet realizing that one of my bones was broken, I limped along Cambridge’s streets and carried on with my night, thinking my foot had been merely sprained. I had never broken a bone before and convinced myself that the pain was just another example of teenage melodrama. When the doctor relayed the results of my x-ray the next morning, I was dumbfounded. Given my botched landing, my inability to walk on my left foot, and the considerable pain I was feeling, it shouldn’t have been all that surprising that I had, in fact, broken a bone. And yet, it was. I was blind to the fact that my body couldn’t handle everything, and that, in some tangible ways, I was delicate. I had somehow adopted the belief that my pain didn’t matter, and that however bad an injury felt in the moment, I could always “walk it off.” For the first time in my life, I had proof, in black and white film, that I had been critically misled. I know I am not alone. Black people in America learn from a young age that our pain isn’t real — that however badly we are treated, our bodies can weather it. In the media’s seemingly never-ending loop of footage featuring Black people being beaten by police officers and dramatizations of enslavers whipping the enslaved, the main takeaway is always our resiliency as a people, the teflon twin of the American Dream. The evidence of this wide-reaching lie is heartbreaking. Multiple studies have shown that American doctors believe Black patients feel less pain and under-prescribe pain medication relative to what they would recommend for a white patient suffering from the same injuries. One 2016 studyrevealedthat 40 percent of first and second-year medical students thought that the skin of Black people was quite literally thicker than that of white people. Implicit biases like this have made it so that Black people receive systematicallyworse careon average compared to white Americans. These biases, which have been immortalized by the barbarism of theTuskegee Experimentand medical abuse ofHenrietta Lacks, have no doubt led to thousands of preventable deaths and are felt today in the crueldisproportionality of maternal mortality among Black women. The organ that’s meant to protect our bodies from exposure to the outside world and all its dangers has become a literal target on our backs. Something for us to hate and for everyone else to fear. The tragic irony of these racist lies is that Black people actuallydie soonerthan white people, and that fromheart diseasetoasthma, African Americans also get sick at higher rates. I truly believe that if Black people weren’tthree times more likelyto get Covid-19 than white people, the first year of America’s Covid-19 response would have been taken far more seriously and been on par with that of other industrialized countries. The millions of years cumulatively lost by Black Americans is time which the families of those that are dead can never get back. When this moral catastrophe is understood in the context of American history, the lines between the dots quickly connect. It’s no accident that the response to thecrack epidemic in Black communitieswas an increase in policing and harsher sentences, while the response to theopioid epidemicis not only more medical aid to affected communities but also a righteous effort to punish those who wereresponsiblefor manufacturing the crisis, as opposed to blaming the victims. The evidence is clear and overwhelming: Black people’s health and wellbeing is not only ignored but attacked in this country because our institutions don’t feel the need to protect Black lives the same way they do white ones. Yet, in spite of all this, there are signs of progress. I was heartened by the courage of Naomi Osaka and Simone Biles last year when they put their wellbeingbefore competition, even despite the immense backlash they faced from people who seemingly wouldn’t care if either one were to injure themselves or face mental health consequences for going beyond their limits. My hope for the future is that the arts and academia accurately capture the pain and tenderness that Black people are capable of feeling as human beings. That American institutions move urgently to close these disparities in healthcare and quality of treatment for Black people. That non-Black people never confuse their pity and patronization for love and care. And my wish for Black people is that we take our health and wellbeing more seriously than we have been taught to, and that we understand the beauty and strength that lies in our inevitable fragility.

rice_thresher_2022_65,"ByThresher Editorial Board1/25/22 11:19pm In August 2021, the Office of the Provostannouncedinstructors could now opt out of showing their course evaluations to students amid the change to remote learning. Regardless of circumstances, the option of hiding evaluations is detrimental to students searching to understand the potential difficulties of future courses. Although the past two years of remote learning have been “highly irregular,” as the provost noted, course evaluations have continually fulfilled their role to students. Criticizing a course being taught remotely still holds relevance to students who will also have to take the class virtually, and provides a more nuanced understanding of the course as a whole. While there are plenty of differences between in-person and online classes, it is ultimately still the same class with the same professor. It would be helpful for students to know if their peers have had previous issues with a professor, found the course to be unorganized, or the workload to be overwhelming, even if these negative experiences occurred when the class was online. It will always be helpful for students to know how accommodating a professor may be, whether in regards to COVID or other issues such as mental health, and it is antithetical to the idea of honest peer evaluations if faculty can block assessments that portray them negatively. That being said, it should go without saying that students should not use their anonymous platform to disparage faculty. Although we have previously focused on the importance of faculty accommodating students, it is just as important for students to accommodate their professors. Evaluations should contextualize the fact that instructors may also be simultaneously dealing with pandemic-related stressors while attempting to replicate an in-person learning experience. Claims such as those that professors aren’t answering questions often or seem to teach their course with little interest should also indicate that those changes may be a result of the transition to Zoom. Course evaluations are an incredibly important tool for students, and this tool needs to remain truthful to be useful. Professors should not be able to hide their course evaluations because of negative portrayals, but this also requires students not to abuse their power when writing evaluations.

thetech_mit_2022_44,"A year ago, many graduate workers hadn’t even heard of our union. Now we’re only a week away from having a real voice on campus. When I first heard about the unionization effort three years ago, I was immediately on board. I had been at MIT long enough to know that most people here don’t have a real say in how the university works, and having a union to change that for grad students made a lot of sense. But I didn’t know the first thing about organizing. I met with the other grad students who wanted a union — there were only a few dozen of us then — and I learned pretty quickly what it looked like to build a union: talking to people, finding out what mattered to them, and taking collective action to move forward together. I wasn’t a very outgoing person; I didn’t like meeting new people, and I was afraid of embarrassing myself in conversations with people. But I wanted to try anyway, because I felt like I couldn’t just stand on the sidelines while other people did the work to build this thing that I really wanted. So I started talking to my friends and coworkers, and they started talking to their friends and coworkers, and in September 2021, we had over 1,000 people at our launch rally. 24 hours after we launched our union, 25% of graduate workers had joined. Just a few weeks later, a clear majority had signed their union cards.In workplaces with more worker-friendly labor laws, that would have been enough to win recognition.Now, over 2,000 graduate student-workers have signed ourvote yes petitionto publicly support our union. Reaching this point has taken a lot of hard work, and MIT’s administrators haven’t made it easy. Unfortunately, they have a lot of advantages over grad workers. They use a dozen different soapboxes to scare grad workers from taking a single step out of line. They hand out talking points to confused faculty whom they order to do their dirty work for them. They have a war chest to pay for fancy lawyers so they can try to disenfranchise a fifth of grad workers. But we’ve overcome every single one of those obstacles. For every anti-union administrator, there’s a thousand grad workers who can’t afford rent, who can’t take time off to see their families, who can’t get access to the equipment they need to do their research.And those grad workers have shown that they are ready to vote YES for our union. MIT has money and cheap tricks on their side — we have genuine love, strength in numbers, and unity on ours. Making our hopes a reality When deciding to come to the Media Lab, I was told that we were about to embark on a radical research experience different from any other research institution in the country. I was told that research was going to be fun and flexible and that we would have the agency to freely explore our passions in our work. However, once I joined the Media Lab, I found that these had been false promises. My principal investigator (PI was chronically late to meetings or would miss them entirely without warning. At the same time, he micromanaged me meticulously, sporadically calling me to ask why I wasn’t appearing online on Slack during the workday. It quickly became clear that I was nothing more than a code monkey for a PI who didn’t care at all for my development. I repeatedly brought these issues to a Media Lab administrator. She was nice and supportive, but the interventions she could offer were limited. My situation continued to worsen, so we escalated the issue to my department s academic head — who was not only good friends with my PI, but also the very man who had hired him. Eventually, every single research assistant (RA in my group raised concerns about my advisor, but our working conditions remained unchanged. If I wanted to continue at MIT, I needed to change my PI. I quickly found that this wasn’t an easy thing to do in my department, which was especially cagey when it came to funding. The department went back and forth for months, and with each passing month, I felt more and more precarious. Ultimately, out of luck, I was able to join a new lab with a PI who actually cares about my work. No one on this campus should have to face the anxiety I felt during these long months.Our union has since fought for and won guaranteed transitional funding for RAs in precisely the same situation I was in. Had this change come one semester sooner, my security at MIT would never have been left to the whims of my department.This is why we need a union: so we can secure this kind of institute-wide policy change in a union contract. As I started to organize with our union and have conversations with fellow graduate workers at tabling sessions, office walkthroughs, and dorm visits, I learned firsthand that funding security was just the tip of the iceberg.From having a fair grievance procedure and affordable housing to simple things like dental care and proper parking access, we have so much to fight for and so much to win. Changing MIT for the better is just the tip of the iceberg; we are organizing a union for a better world. Over the last six months, we ve been inspired by the incredible organizing that has taken place on this campus. We have learned so much from being part of this campaign. We’ve built a vast network of union reps, created a broad and inclusive organization by reaching out to workers from every corner of this campus, and supported each other in the face of MIT’s aggressive anti-union campaign. For many of us, these lessons won’t end at MIT.We are scientists, technologists, designers, artists, writers, and tinkerers, and we will spend our post-MIT careers working at cutting edge technology institutions all over the world — from global biotech firms like Moderna or Pfizer to bootstrap startups building the future of the internet.We’re inspired by all of our colleagues who will move forward together not only to win our election, but also to bring the community and solidarity that we’ve built over the course of this campaign to workplaces all over the world.

state_press_2022_11,"Teen dramas open conversations about mature topics, but it is often difficult to draw a line between educating and glamorizing. Everyone loves a good binge-worthy show that has the audience gripping the edge of their seats, wondering what will happen next, and trendy teen dramas are no exception. While the glitz and glitter of shows geared toward younger audiences likeEuphoria,Gleeand13 Reasons Whycould be beneficial in sparking a conversation about mature topics like the downfalls of drug addiction, exploring sexual liberation and the effects of sexual assault, when do these shows begin to glamorize these topics rather than educate? On one hand, it is important for adolescents to be educated on the matters covered in teen dramas since it could help them navigate the challenging lives they will face transitioning into adults. However, it is important to consider whether these shows are the appropriate means for providing this education. I think having teen dramas that deal with such hard topics is kind of like a double-edged sword, said Manuel Elizalde, a sophomore studying law and policy. Elizalde said these shows have the power to either influence their young audiences to avoid destructive habits or teach them how to indulge in risky behaviors. It’s no secret that media, especially when consumed so vastly by a specific age group, has lasting effects on teenagers who could be viewing these very real-world experiences for the first time. TV shows and movies can often present unrealistic scenarios for the purpose of drawing in more viewers but portray them in a way that appears less concerning for the age group. Marissa Sidur-Rodriguez, a senior studying forensic psychology, said she never felt very connected to reality TV shows as a teenager, since although teens do engage in sexual activity and experiment with drugs, no one has any inhibitions. It’s all party-fun time. But that’s not really the case. In regard to how media exposure to teenagers is correlated to eating disorders, research in theJournal of Social and Clinical Psychologypublished by Guilford Press Periodicals cites how susceptible adolescents are to body image issues, and that it s directly related to their consumption of media. Exposure to shows where over-sexualization of teenage characters is a prevalent theme, drug use and alcohol abuse are normalized and very serious topics are mishandled happens more often than not, and can cause irreparable damage to social dynamics that could seep into adulthood. Obviously teen dramas are exaggerated and meant to teach, but I think that having such dramas also causes teens to see the fun side of doing drugs without many of the consequences, Elizalde said. Another controversial topic discussed when analyzing shows catered toward adolescents that portray teenagers in high school is the casting decisions, which also have a hand to play in setting the stage for unrealistic standards of adolescent experiences. Nowadays, it’s almost uncommon for an actual teenager to play a teenage character in a show. In Euphoria, almost the entirety of the main cast playingjuniorsin high school are actors in their late twenties and even early thirties. Seeing an older cast engaging in adult behaviors under the guise of being teenagers can disorient audiences and lead them to see things like substance use and underage sex to be not as harmful as they can be. Guillerly Mendez, a senior studying English, said she respects the effort that teen dramas put into creating awareness for drug abuse, mental health issues and other habits that kids develop while still in school. “I totally respect like what these shows, you know, put the effort in making… I guess like this awareness for drug abuse, mental health issues, things that go on in schools that still could probably continue existing this whole time, Mendez said. While not sure whether she would consider the TV shows beneficial, she valued that it was important to be aware of the types of problems that people can get themselves into and what happens in their own personal lives that not everybody could experience as well. The role of the audience should be to look toward more nuanced forms of getting an education about subjects that involve sexual violence, sexual liberation and substance abuse. These shows, like any other binge-worthy hit, should still be enjoyed but watched with a certain caution and understanding that these shows are made for entertainment and shouldn t be used to solely base a livelihood and education.

crimson_2022_164,"How can a research university address problems of health care delivery, especially for the poor or otherwise vulnerable? The late Paul Farmer asked that same question to open anop-ed published in The Crimsoneleven years ago this past May. As we commemorate his remarkable life and legacy at a University-wide memorial event on October 1, revisiting this question has never been more urgent. At the heart of Paul’s vision for mobilizing universities to address global health inequities are two powerful ideas: That health care is a human right and that disparities in health outcomes and access to quality health care are symptoms of deep historical injustices. This moral clarity guided his life’s work, an essential part of which was his commitment to building global health as a vibrant discipline for education, research, and service. The past few years have seen the coincidence of two major global forces which have highlighted the importance of universities in addressing global health inequities. First is the growing acknowledgement that health disparities are inseparable from the global history of colonialism which led to the inequitable distribution of power and resources within and between nations — the subject of Paul’s final book. Second is the deepening of existing health inequities by the pandemic. Witness, for example, higher Covid-19 mortality rates in low-income communities and the offering of now multiple rounds of boosters in wealthy countries while many in less-resourced countries had not even received their first dose. These inequities are all set to worsen as the health consequences of climate change begin to bite deeper, hitting the already worse-off the hardest. As these global challenges mount, we are called to embrace and advance the legacy Paul left us. We must do so with a clear moral vision. Strong collaborations with institutions that serve low-income or marginalized populations are at the heart of our efforts to realize global health equity. Such partnerships must be founded upon the kind of long-term, consistent commitment necessary for building deep and mutually rewarding relationships. As Paul argued in his op-ed, it is insufficient to invest solely in one’s own students and faculty; instead, he argued that “every training program at Harvard should be ‘mirrored’ by similar commitments to help our host countries address their own training needs, since in each of these countries there are talented students and trainees who would also like to devote themselves to improving the health of their fellow citizens.” Turning these stirring words into bold action, Paul spearheaded the founding of the University of Global Health Equity in Rwanda in 2014, which has since emerged as a major force in the field in the Global South. The best memorial we can offer for Paul’s untimely passing is critical reflection on how we might further his vision of “accompaniment” — an approach to global health that calls for universities like ours to partner deeply with less-privileged institutions that closely align with our mission. There is no place in global health for those who wish to bungee jump in and out of contexts like tourists. Accompaniment requires a deep and long-term investment in mutual capacity across fields and disciplines. It is essential for these collaborations to be acknowledged as central to the University s mission to create a more equitable world. Our partner institutions offer unprecedented and privileged access to populations in disadvantaged contexts that is essential for global health research and practice. Moreover, we need to emphasize that investing in partnerships with such institutions is not an act of charity but a fulfillment of duty. We must also acknowledge that global health is not just about people in other countries; vast health disparities persist in the U.S. despite the fact that we spend much more on health care than any other country in the world. Our partnerships must also embrace domestic institutions serving populations with poorer health outcomes and limited access to quality care, including rural communities and low-income neighborhoods. In the concluding remarks of his op-ed, Paul wrote that “taking global health from a hobby to a serious pursuit is well within our reach if we commit adequate resources to a series of tasks that include research, training, and improved delivery of quality care.” We pride ourselves on being a University committed to solving the world’s most pressing problems through education, research and service, and there can be few issues as important as global health equity. Eleven years after Paul called on us to treat global health as more than just a hobby, it is time for the University to rededicate itself to the goals and vision that he lived by and animated so brilliantly through partnerships with institutions serving the poor and marginalized. Harvard’s commitment to redress its role in slavery by financing partnerships with historically Black educational institutions in the U.S. offers a model for how we might similarly nurture partnerships with institutions in the Global South. We need to do this both because of our moral responsibility to support equity, social justice, and human rights and dignity and because such partnerships represent a fundamental asset to nurture, support, and value global health. Without this kind of commitment, the mission of Harvard Medical School to “nurture a diverse, inclusive community dedicated to alleviating suffering and improving health and well-being for all through excellence in teaching and learning, discovery and scholarship, and service and leadership” cannot truly be realized.

crimson_2022_98,"Harvard Square is unfamiliar to me. T0 many, Harvard and its surrounding area are the locus of education, student life, tourism, and good times. Many revisit to relive their glory days, soak in the colonial architecture of the Yard, or learn about scholarship of the past and innovations of tomorrow. But I have come to this place, met with some of the world s brightest minds, next world leaders, dreamers, achievers, changemakers — and to me it has never been more than a place without the beauty supply store. And yes, I know, it sounds really shallow. I sit in my childhood home and from every window in every direction I can tell you of a beauty supply store — affectionately known to me as the hair store — that is not more than 10 minutes away. They are staples in the communities that surround them, suppliers of all things hair and personal care, but mostly, it was the place where I went to figure out who I was and who I wanted to be. I now look out the window from my Harvard dorm room, and when I search for the road to myself in every direction, I don’t know which way to go. And I yearn for a reminder that I belong here. The beauty supply store is a place not just about sales, but also about learning respect for, love for, and agency over my own body — starting from the very roots that grow from my head. It was there for me before Solange rejected having her hair touched over a neo soul melody, before Beyoncé declared she liked her “baby heir with baby hair and afros”, before Miranda Bailey taught Derek Shepherd aboutZola’s kitchenon Grey’s Anatomy, before pulling girls’ weaves and “yaga”s became pop culture phenomena. It was always the place where I could go to find the supplies that would nurture the expression of my soul. For Black women, hair has always been serious business. Historically, it s a sacred cultural andspiritual symbol. We fashion our hair for more than just style, but rather as demonstrations of our individual essences and signifiers of Black culture. The appearance of our hair is often taken as a statement about who we are, who we think we are, and who we want to be. And like many other things tied to Black culture, Black people’s — particularly Black women’s — hair is knotted and tangled in issues of race, politics, popular culture, history, and questions of self-worth. And it’s no secret that eurocentric beauty standards for hair — long, thick, straight or particular forms of curly— have for generations been deemed the adequate down payment on the American Dream. Because in America, to fit into a cherished ideal is to fit into normative white perspectives and aesthetics on what’s professional, or better yet, what’s beautiful. But a neighborhood that lacks convenience for minority hair care products is one that I believe has failed its inhabitants. It insinuates that there is no importance in predominantly-white towns being able to provide minority residents with daily essentials that meet our own personal preferences. What’s more, is that it pushes forth the narrative that people of color — most often Black people — must compromise their identity to satisfy others. It’s a microaggressive way to emphasize our ever-standing position as central to American culture whilst perennially marginalized by it. The hair store is more than a store. It’s more than just beauty supplies sold in the name of vanity. It is a cultural and community center. It is a place with the power to create and support important foundational experiences — from finding oneself in the ’fro, to falling in silky love with yourself under a new hair scarf or bonnet, to choosing the right style and colors for your next braided hairdo, or maybe picking up the right brand of deodorant, body wash, hair mask, or lip gloss. Trivial as these moments may seem, it’s in those instances that Black women have the access and ability to exercise agency over the way we choose to express ourselves, and with which styles, products, and personal care we intend to do so. A hair store could make Harvard feel a bit more like home. At the very least, it would let me know that there is some semblance of belonging for those that look like me in the surrounding community, after all. I hope to see a beauty supply store make its way into Harvard Square sometime soon. Put it on the short-list of Harvard Square community necessities — right next to aMcDonald’s. Kyla N.

wildcat_arizona_2022_49,"An illustration of students protesting against racism by Mary Ann Vagnerova. Jared Taylorheadlined a speaking eventhosted by College Republicans United at Arizona State University Sept. 2. Taylor is the founder of The New Century Foundation, which is most notably known for the American Renaissance – an online opinions journal that has continuously made arguments in support of white nationalism and white superiority. His presence on campus is appalling and should be condemned by ASU. Yet, unfortunately, it was allowed. Since ASU took no action in stopping this event, it should at the very least prompt them to take urgent action in creating a more inclusive campus. Taylor is a direct and imminent threat to students of color on campus. It was reported byNortheast Valley Newsthat some students who were attempting to get into the event “were denied access because of the way they looked or dressed.” This is not surprising at all since the speaking event was titled, “If We Do Nothing: A Defense of White Identity Politics.” The spreading of white supremacist ideology created by events like this supports an environment that dehumanizes and presents a severe threat to students of color on the campus. Mental and physical health and overall quality of life diminish for students of color who experience discrimination.NBC Newsrecently reported that data taken from a 10-year survey, “found that people ages 18 to 28 who experienced consistent short- or long-term discrimination are 25 percent more likely to experience psychological distress, to be diagnosed with a mental illness or to report excessive drug use.” ASU is responsible for keeping students safe on campus, both from physical harm and mental distress caused by events such as this one. They have guaranteed this responsibility by stating that, “it is our job to ensure the safety and well-being of your student,” on theirpublicEducational Outreach and Student Services website. Yet, their actions prove otherwise when they allow people like Taylor to create an atmosphere of harm on campus. RELATED:White supremacist invited to address ASU student Republican club Although many in defense of Taylor,includingASU, have cited the First Amendment as a reason for allowing this speaking event to happen, it does not take away the damage this has caused to the student body. A First Amendment statement was given from theBlack African Coalitionat ASU: “The Black African Coalition respects the First Amendment, but we do not align ourselves when that amendment is used to belittle the heritage of ourselves and our peers.” On its admission website,ASUinsists that it will, “value and welcome students no matter their ethnicity, the religion they practice (or don’t practice , the language their family speaks, who they love, or the type of clothes they wear.” The student body and several student organizations are rightfully calling for ASU to uphold its self-proclaimed values of diversity and inclusion and go against inappropriate uses of the First Amendment. A student, Yeison Bautista Pejay, who attended an ASU protest in Tempe on Sep. 2 against Taylor’s speaking event told to me over the phone, that “i t may not seem like a big deal now, but every time people like Taylor and College Republicans United are tolerated, they lead to nastier infestations of violence against people of color. ASU has the power to stop history from repeating.” Along with negative student sentiment against the speaking of Taylor, over 25 student organizations affiliated with ASU spoke out in opposition to Taylor’s event, including the groupCollege Republicans at ASU. Pejay concluded with a belief many seem to share, and many need to realize, saying that he is, “again disappointed in how ASU has taken one of its principles it prides itself on, ‘accepting everyone’, and has used it as an excuse to let something like this happen.” Accountability at all universities is of utmost importance, and it is up to the student body to hold their university to its standards. Making sure public universities protect students and families from exploitation and abuse and provide all students with a high-quality education should be the primary goal of ASU and universities across Arizona. It is important that ASU takes action on this immediately and release an apology to all students of color on campus and guarantee that white supremacy will not be tolerated or allowed on campus again.

crimson_2022_77,"I never wanted to take a gap year. It wasn’t an option that had ever been on the table. I was graduating high school in June of 2020, and then I was going to college in the fall. That was as fixed as the sun rising over the horizon day after day. Then my high school postponed an economics summit hosting international students from China. My mom brought up the topic for the first time at the beginning of March. It was offhand: “If this thing gets worse, you might want to think about taking a year off.” I brushed her words away. An overreaction. Then it hit. Two weeks at home, then a month, then three. Suddenly, the end of my childhood was a ceremony without pomp, the catharsis of graduation thwarted by the cortisol of half an apocalypse. As I tell my friends now, I got all of high school — except the good part. Somewhere in the pile of milestones turned inside out by that new reality was college. My parents pressured me to defer my admission, but I saw a gap year as an extension of the purgatory of that spring into a small eternity. Our fights punctured the eerily quiet fabric of a life on hold. As the deadline approached, it became clear they were not going to change their minds, and there was nothing more I could do. The loss of control was terrifying. If I couldn’t stop one year from disappearing into the void of the pandemic, what would I do if Groundhog Day lasted two years? Three? I needed to reinvent myself, but I had no access to the person I was going to be, not yet. I looked at the calendar and saw only March 15, 2020. I relived the shift I’d worked that morning at Starbucks, my last memory of a world now frozen in an alien amber. In February 2021, I drove to my high school’s parking lot and listened to songs that reminded me of senior year, trying to exhale. I still couldn’t. Taking a gap year — not any gap year, but this gap year — felt like abdicating part of my identity. The pandemic was terrible for the class below us too, but they had time to prepare. We were blindsided; they were not. 2020 was our trauma, our bonding experience, our storm to weather. What happened to me when I put up an umbrella and waited for it to pass? The semesters I missed, by all accounts, were awful. Those who stayed tell me I made the right choice, and I see why: Zoom school can’t hold a candle to the real thing. But as my long-awaited launch date approached, it felt wrong. When I left everyone behind, running away from the hollow mess of a year at college they endured together, I thought I’d lost the privilege of anticipation. I shoved that feeling so deep inside I could feel only its tremors on the surface. But I couldn’t help but pinch myself the first time I set foot in Annenberg. I still went through five concentrations in three months. And I felt guilty — that with every inexperienced move, I was letting my true cohort fly further and further away. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t convince myself that I was living in the right timeline. Maybe it was grief — an amalgamation of denial and bargaining — or a coping mechanism, but starting in about April 2020, I’d daydream that none of it was real. I’d forget every deformed milestone, every night spent pacing my basement trying to psychoanalyze away the shot that destroyed my best-laid plans. The movie was over, and I was going to Harvard in the fall after graduating from high school, living the life I had pictured when the world made sense. The dreams have come less frequently these days, as the chasm between reality and fantasy has widened, but they haven’t disappeared. Sometimes I let them stay a few extra seconds, just to feel the warmth. I worry that the control I lost will never return, even when Covid-19 is a distant memory. This fear is a faint alarm in the back of my head. The conductor plays a slow diminuendo, but the drone goes on and on. But as the strings draw out their single note, so too do I go on. I’m not the same person I would have been if things had happened the way I’d planned. There was no pause button, as much as I might have wished for one. I worked a full-time job, and spent a season at an intensive outdoor program. I’m in a different place than I envisioned I’d be when I applied to college, but I have new perspectives, new opportunities. Whether or not every part of the year was valuable, calluses are now embedded in the patchwork guiding me forward. I’m slowly learning to accept them, to grow comfortable with the contours of this new landscape I inhabit. Two years ago, the future I’d imagined for myself imploded in24 frames. Now, I shape my life from its ashes, in a world that bends on the whims of fortune more than I ever thought was possible. Ian D. Svetkey ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Hurlbut Hall."
thetech_mit_2022_3,"MIT is known for solving complex problems. While it’s not nearly as momentous aslanding Americans on the moonordeveloping low-cost emergency ventilators, operating the campus dining program comes with complexchallenges and constraintsthat are seldom visible to meal plan subscribers and dining hall patrons. That’s why in June 2019, Vice Chancellor and Dean for Student Life Suzy Nelson requested the formation of aworking group— consisting of students, heads of house, and staff — to review the student meal plan structure and topropose a new approach, informed by student input, that emphasizes quality and variety, accessibility, and financial sustainability. In subsequent months, theMeal Plan Working Groupreviewed the house dining program’sfeatures and financial parameters, discussedupdated plan commitments, and ultimately proposed anew dining plan structureto Dean Nelson and former Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart, which was previewed at acommunity forum on March 5, 2020. Just a week later, MIT shifted into pandemic mode; campus life was completely disrupted and the dining plan implementation was put on hold for the 2020-21 academic year while undergraduates and house team members living on campus were enrolled in a special meal plan subsidized by MIT. As MIT started work on getting back to pre-pandemic operating conditions last spring, Campus Dining implemented the first phase of the revised meal plan, which included new minimum commitment levels for the Class of 2025. The new minimums will apply to each subsequent incoming class, with the plan reaching full implementation with the Class of 2028. The old minimum commitments will phase out with the Classes of 2023 and 2024. Staff from MIT Dining in the Division of Student Life presented the revised plan at events throughout 2021, including virtual CPW in April, orientation in August, and discussions with the DormCon House Dining Committee last fall. In spite of the necessary changes made to support MIT’s pandemic response, MIT Dining and culinary partner Bon Appétit (BA continued to work on improving facilities and offerings throughout the last two years. For example: System-wide:BA continues to hire new chefs to implement fresh ideas and elevate quality across the system based on the spring 2021 student dining survey results, which suggested that food quality and variety were among meal plan subscribers’ top concerns. Additionally, BA’s director of culinary operations and regional dietician updated staff training to focus on food quality and introduced new menus that provide a broader selection of meals, such as halal entrées at all houses. Don’t just take my word for it — if you haven’t stopped by a campus dining location recently, I encourage you tovisit one of our locationsto experience these improvements for yourself. Maseeh Hall:The entire allergen-free kitchen encompassing theOasis Stationin the Howard Dining Hall is being overhauled to support students with food allergies or who follow special diets. This includes adding new grills, a pasta cooker, and a salad bar specifically for gluten-free items. Also, a new gluten-free pantry and an updated gluten-free station opened in the fall. New Vassar:The dining facility opened at full capacity in the fall, including lunch hours. Students told the Meal Plan Working Group that crowds at Maseeh prevented them from eating a mid-day meal. Since New Vassar opened for lunch, we have seen lunchtime usage of Maseeh and New Vassar start to balance out. Baker:Taking cues from national trends toward healthier, fresher, greens-forward meals, BA introduced the Green Lite salad station last fall. Simmons:The popular late-night snack station moved to Simmons’ servery and brought on a new menu that reflects some of the most popular items served at Maseeh’s late-night station. The house dining program’s success relies on a continuing partnership between students, house teams, staff, and BA, with great reliance placed on community feedback. As a result, Dining will continuethe student satisfaction survey, which has shaped these and other recent program enhancements after it was started last fall in cooperation with student leaders. We will keep communication channels open between students, dining staff, and campus dining so we can keep improving — to let us know what you think, meal plan subscribers can participate in the next dining satisfaction survey and anyone can share feedback on house or campus dining any time throughfoodstuff@mit.edu.

thetech_mit_2022_52,"In recent years, many problems with MIT’s graduate programs have come to light. We need solutions, but I believe that unionization is not the right path. In writing this op-ed, it is my hope that students do not feel ostracized if they choose to vote “no.” My “no” vote does not mean I’m invalidating the need for change or the presence of major issues. Rather, voting “no” means I believe unionization, as it is proposed today, is not suitable for MIT or its graduate students. Representatives from the Graduate Student Union (GSU have claimedthat graduate workers at MIT “currently lack a well-defined job description, leaving the boundaries of our responsibilities extremely ambiguous.” Instead of viewing the ambiguity of research as a freedom, the GSU claims that in the face of “an inappropriate lack of investment in support staff and research infrastructure, graduate students are forced to pick up the slack.” They list a number of tasks they think graduate researchers should not do, including scheduling visitor agendas, manufacturing testing apparatuses, ordering supplies, and maintaining equipment. To me, these tasks can be key elements of a graduate student’s research process. For example, I’ve learned a lot from maintaining the laser cutter I need to build my experimental setups. Some students may consider these tasks grunt work, but in fact, menial tasks provide a critical aspect of learning in academia and industry, especially for students who have chosen a school with a “mens et manus” motto. It is immensely helpful when staff are available to offer assistance, but as graduate students, we should feel ownership over our own work and learning. To become more effective researchers, we must want to do what we need to do to answer our individual questions. Learning to balance all of this will make us better researchers, engineers, and scientists. The ambiguity and flexibility of academia is its appeal. It is why many of us chose a graduate education at MIT over other opportunities. As students conducting research, we answer questions that no one has answered before, meaning that one cannot possibly foresee all the tasks that may be involved. Furthermore, our questions vary greatly across departments, labs, and even within advisor groups. Each individual graduate student’s journey requires a unique set of steps to create new knowledge. How do the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE and GSU imagine they will write a singular representative contract that accounts for the thousands of possible and unpredictable paths that might be taken to solve the tough problems we tackle at MIT? (Remember, the UE’s experience comes primarily from working with very predictable labor roles, not academic research roles. I am concerned that a union contract will greatly reduce the flexibility MIT currently affords students and their advisors as they collaborate to answer novel research questions. This rigidity would ultimately reduce the quality of research MIT graduate students are able to conduct. Isn’t this quality of research and the freedom to work hard to solve unanswered questions what drew us all to MIT in the first place? The GSU has also claimedthat a union would improve education at MIT through better-defined expectations of teaching assistants (TAs and professors. I have been a TA, lab instructor, or team mentor for several classes, including 2.009, 2.007, and 2.00b, during my six years as a graduate student. Through these experiences, I developed a strong sense of what it takes to run a great class at MIT. Sometimes it requires thoughtful, teaching-focused work like developing assignments and grading criteria; other times, it requires less exciting tasks, like updating a class’s Canvas page. However, all of these experiences served to make me a more involved and engaged instructor who better understands my students’ learning needs. If UE defines a TA role, it could overconstrain MIT courses and diminish their quality. For example, if 2.009 were obligated to observe UE-defined, UE-limited TA responsibilities, many iconic elements of the course (such as Build Challenge and the Final Presentations would not be possible. These course activities require flexibility and devotion from all course staff, including TAs, and they make for some of the best learning experiences one can find on a college campus. Many other courses could suffer similarly. Like research, teaching responsibilities vary from department to department, course to course, and year to year. Each year, MIT is rated one of the top schools for undergraduate and graduate education. I foresee that over time, this quality will diminish due to UE’s overconstrained definition of a TA’s role. Additionally, the GSU has failed to mention the potential immediate harm of potential TA strikes on undergraduate education. I personally care too much about the students in my classes to strike and leave them stranded. A strike could also have lasting harm on graduate students and their degree timelines. Because I care about my thesis, I could not support a strike that would slow my research progress. I imagine many graduate students feel the same. I believe that generalizing graduate students’ diverse experiences in a union contract has the potential to disrupt the many, many students who have found demanding yet healthy situations at MIT. The GSU has identified several problems in the graduate community, but I believe many are specific to certain departments, communities (e.g., graduate students with families , or advisor-advisee relationships. Instead of a generalized graduate student union that has the potential for harm, I would rather see solutions that focus specifically on those situations that need more scrutiny or these students who would benefit from increased university support. It worries me deeply that choosing UE to represent MIT graduate students is a legally binding and permanent decision that will impact the Institute for decades to come. As an engineer and designer, I only know how to solve problems through iteration. MIT is a community unlike any other. We haven’t tested a graduate student union at MIT or any kind of partnership with UE, so we have no way to evaluate their effectiveness. Many holes have already been poked in some of the GSU’s claims, so I am skeptical of the rest. I realize MIT students have been attempting to address the issues we face for years and that many are frustrated to have seen few results. I have been one of them. Even so, I favor a methodical, collaborative, and iterative process with the Graduate Student Council and departmental advocacy groups over a permanent, legally-binding fix with UE.

state_press_2022_5,"Jared Taylor walking on ASU s Tempe campus accompanied by police on Friday, Sept. 2, 2022. On Sept. 2,known white supremacistand self-proclaimed white advocate Jared Taylor delivered a speech entitled If we do nothing: A defense of white identity politics, hosted by ASU sCollege Republicans United. The event, hosted in one of ASU s biggest lecture halls, did not shock ASU students privy to ASU perpetuating bigotry. ASU administration should not platform bigoted speech, as it targets minority communities and perpetuates white supremacy on campus. While it is an accomplishment to be ranked as atop university for promoting free speech, this achievement is dampened by the fact that it seems to mean ASU will continue to platform racism and white supremacy while ignoring the needs and demands of students. Taylor is an advocate of race-realism, a racist pseudoscience that holds the belief that certain races are inferior or superior to others. He has promoted the belief that the U.S. should remain predominantly European and white. It is not surprising his presence at ASU was met with condemnation and criticism from a variety of students. Other student organizations, includingASU Women s Coalition,Young Democratic Socialists of AmericaandStudents for Justice of Palestine, supported a statement condemning the event and called for ASU administration to ban Taylor from speaking on campus. Groups also called for administration to stop recognizing CRU as a student organization and to issue an apology for allowing white supremacy to be promoted on campus. ASU has a history of hosting problematic, racist speakers. Just last year, CRU hosted white nationalist and holocaust-denier Vincent James Foxx. In 2015, School of Social and Behavioral Sciences faculty associate Robert Poesupported a fellow professor who was targeted by white supremacists for teaching classes on critical race theory. Although he and other faculty showed concern for the security of the professor being targeted, administration seemed to stayed silent, Poe said. They definitely kind of wanted it to go away at the time. They didn t want the publicity or the negative publicity about the University, Poe said. Poe said the issue is not free versus hate speech, but that ASU platforms bigoted ideals such as white supremacy and neo-nazism. The debate between what counts as hate speech and what is protected free speech is difficult to navigate, but it is clear ASU administration does not see the problems that arise from allowing bigotry to have a platform. It seems ASU is more concerned with protecting white nationalists who are not affiliated with the school than it is with providing a safe environment for its own students. Students have continuously shown discomfort and condemnation of events like these, only to be met with silence and complacency from ASU administration. ASU President Michael Crow recently released a statement addressing the event, claiming it is his personal opinion that the particular ideas Jared Taylor espouses have no place in the advancement of American democracy. However, Crow touts ASU s free speech policy protects Jared Taylor and other guest speakers. In the introduction to Taylor s speech, CRU founder Richard Thomas thanked Crow for going out of his way to allow the event to take place. I d like to express my appreciation for Arizona State University, Thomas said. The administration, I understand, came under very considerable pressure trying to get this event canceled, and they held firm. That s unusual these days. When there is substantial outcry from students, clubs and faculty, ASU administration fails to fulfill its duty as an educational institution by continuously being silent on matters regarding white supremacy, leaving ASU s communities vulnerable and unprotected. ASU administration needs to rethink how they approach these situations so that they are not platforming bigotry. Edited by Sadie Buggle, Grace Copperthite, Sophia Balasubramanian and Piper Hansen.

ubyssey_2022_38,"Feb. 8, 2022 Written byDaphnée Lévesque Today, I’m going to share some personal objects and belongings that I have accumulated over the years. Those items are what I call “comfort objects” because they serve a specific purpose in my life. They reduce my anxiety, help me when boredom settles in and comfort me when I need to distract myself or cope with a painful feeling. A Zen garden’s purpose is to cultivatecalmness and peace. Apparently, it even has mental and psychological benefits. For example, Zen gardens come with a mini rake, and the movements and curves in the sand bring you back to the present moment. It’s a way to practice mindfulness and to reduce anxiety. It can also help you focus. My mini Zen garden sits on my desk. I like to draw different patterns in the sand, and it almost feels like I’m meditating while doing so. I absolutely love mykinetic sand kit! It’s a form of play, and similarly to the mini Zen garden, it helps you with staying present. Kinetic sand is helpful when you’re anxious, because playing with the sand distracts you from feelings of anxiety. It forces you to be present in your body as you build castles and other shapes. It’s a sensory experience that is often beneficial to children — but even as an adult, I find that a “hands on” activity can help in many ways! Painting rocks is the best! Not only is painting a great activity, but the rocks are also nice to keep around and admire. The colours, textures, different shapes and images have the power to add a little bit of positivity to your life. I believe that everyone should own a favourite mug (or water bottle, tea thermos, you get the idea . There’s something comforting about having a familiar object close to you. I am personally attached to my favourite coffee mug — it’s become part of my routine and brings me joy (sometimes, it’s the little things in life that matter the most . Another comforting object for me is my diffuser and my many bottles of essential oils. Not everybody is a fan, but I like the smell of pine needles and rainforest, and I think that it brings me comfort because it smells so good and helps me relax. You can also opt for incense or candles. I think everyone should be able to feel entirely cozy in bed (or on the couch . I think that having a good-quality blanket that feels comfortable and warm (or cool, if you’re a human furnace can make the difference between a good night’s sleep and an okay one. I’ve slept over at friends’ houses, and when I wrapped myself in their blankets made with completely un-cozy materials, I noticed. So, if you can, invest in a good blanket or pillow. We ve also heard good things about heated blankets! Whether it’s a favourite painting or Polaroids taken with friends, I think there is something special about having an object that you can admire and look at closely. Personally, I love looking at old pictures of happy memories because they remind me that despite life’s ups and downs, it is possible to create good memories with the people you cherish. Similarly, I love looking at paintings because it’s a great way to appreciate an artist’s work and practice being mindful of yourself and the world. My roommate gifted me little cards with inspiring quotes on them. They are pretty to look at and I often snap a picture of them to post on social media. Sometimes, it just helps to look at a beautifully-designed card with an inspiring phrase. As a student, I own my fair share of pens, post-its and paper pads. I think that having a favourite pen (or binder, or notepad can be comforting because it’s a familiar cherished possession. I know that in the past, having my favourite pen meant “good luck” when writing exams. Having school materials that you like can make you feel more comfortable when studying or working — at least, that’s what I’ve found for myself. Well, that’s all I have for today! I hope that you have a few objects that will comfort you during difficult times. If not, it may be time to invest in one. Sometimes, we need something tangible to keep us in the moment. I know that having comfort objects in my house helps me feel more at ease in my day-to-day life. So give it a thought, and let’s see what you can find.

wildcat_arizona_2022_7,"Protestors gather at the “Rally for Abortion Justice” on Saturday, Oct. 2 in Jácome Plaza. The march was met with support from individuals of all age ranges, genders and backgrounds. Over the past 100 years, feminism has worn many faces. We have experiencedthree wavesof feminism, each extremely different than the wave that came before it. Thewaves of feminism The first wave’s main goal was trying to cement that women deserve the right to vote and other basic rights. This idea was the first of its kind and extremely radical for the time. Women were starting to make their voices heard and thus began the women’s suffrage movement. They recognized the injustices in their society and decided to speak up and make a change. Their bravery sparked a movement that is still alive today. In the second wave, the focus switched from ensuring women have basic rights to fighting for liberation. Women had received the right to vote, but that was not enough for them and they began to call out the other injustices they noticed in the world. The success in the women’s suffrage movement was inspirational for those in the second wave of feminism and pushed them to continue their fight. The new platforms the movement took on contained equal treatment in the workforce, reproductive rights and the fight against the objectification of women. The continuation of previous fights and the introduction of new platforms is a defining trait of the feminist movement that has continues to this day. The third wave started in the 1990s and it consists of movements such as the #MeToo movement and has a heavy emphasis on reproductive rights and the inclusivity of all identities. The shape feminism has taken today When taking a deeper look into the third wave of feminism that we are in today, it can be considered as a more accepting movement that recognizes the accomplishments of those behind them and strives to build on these in the now. This wave of feminists grew up watching the many women that were breaking the glass ceiling and they have had countless role models. Being born in 2001, I have grown up seeing women in STEM, politics, entertainment and more and never thought that any career path was impossible for me just because I was a woman. Along with the visibility of women in power that I grew up with, I also grew up seeing the many effects that the drive of those in the feminist movement can have on policy and society. I have marched in marches, heard the pleas of women, and over time these pleas became reality. This encouragement has strengthened me and those around me and allowed us to see the possibilities of keeping up a fight. Today the feminist movement is as strong as ever but somewhere in these waves the meaning of the word “feminist” got clouded by the stereotypes that have been built up over the duration of the movement. Feminists have been placed in a box and faced with a negative connotation, completely discounting an entire demographic of the movement. These stereotypes were created by those who were threatened by women’s realization of their worth and what they deserve. It was not until the late 90s that women began to lose this image of a stereotypical feminist and start to recognize the various multidimensional women behind the movement. Feminism became intersectional and took on fighting for the rights of many groups of people. The movement today thrives on its inclusivity of every demographic. Feminism has become intersectional, taking on the fight for not only women but also other identities who are underrepresented today. Throughout the early 2000s, a realization has been made that throughout history there is too much emphasis on straight, white women in the movement and that intersectionality is crucial in ensuring that injustices are fixed. Those in this movement today are fearlessly fighting for equality and are being led by those before them who have boldly paved the way.

crimson_2022_20,"Pro-Israel and Jewish students on this campus are staring down the barrel of antisemitism — quite literally. The Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee has invited a speaker into our community who oncetweeted“God rid us of the Zionists,” a statement that we find obviously incendiary as proud Zionists on this campus. Palestinian writer and poet Mohammed El-Kurd is slated to speak at an event this Monday, titled “Confronting State Violence: Divestment & Youth Activism,” which is being co-sponsored by the Harvard Law School Middle Eastern Law Students Association, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, and Harvard Kennedy School’s Palestine Caucus, and will focus on the movement to boycott and divest from Israel. Digging through El-Kurd’s work surfaces numerous instances of language we were taught in our Jewish day schools was antisemitic. Consider his poetry collection “Rifqa,” in which El-Kurdseemsto reference the Israeli state, writing that “they harvest organs of the martyred, feed their warriors our own.” These lines evoke an antisemitic playbook dating back to the Middle Ages, in which Jews are accused of murdering Christian children and baking their Passover matzah with the children’s blood. El-Kurd has alsotweeted, seemingly in reference to Israeli security forces, that he “hates these pigs”and“hopes every one of them dies in the most torturous & slow ways. I hope that they see their mothers suffering (not that these conscienceless pigs would care .” He alsoequatesthe Israeli government’s practices with those of the Nazis in the Holocaust, a baseless comparison that the U.S. State Department explicitlydeemsantisemitic. At times, El-Kurd has seemed to condone violence against the Jewish state outright. Hepraisedthe “martyrs” of the Second Intifada, an uprising that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians, both Palestinian and Israeli. He hasexcusedthe actions of Hamas, which include launching rockets at innocent people in populated areas, whileclaimingthat Israel has no right to defend itself against the terrorists whose actions he dismisses. One of us was present in Jerusalem in May 2021, when Hamas fired rockets at Israel’s capital, and had to seek cover in a bomb shelter with his elderly relatives for several minutes until the attack was over. Given that harrowing experience, we cannot help but find El-Kurd’s tweets callous at best. El-Kurd has evendefendeda USC student government representative whowantedto “kill every motherf****** zionist.” If this does not qualify as hateful, then what does? As Zionists, whose connection to the land of Israel plays an integral role in our Jewish identity, who proudly sing “Next year in Jerusalem” every year at our Passover Seder, who view the Jewish return to Israel as the realization of the dreams of generations of our forebears, we are pained to see a speaker come to our campus who seems to support violence in opposition to a core part of our identity. Harvard already has an antisemitism problem. Just this past year, many Jews were horrified to hearallegationsby Government Professor Eric M. Nelson ’99 that a swastika symbol had been found in Currier House. They weredisgustedto see imagery reminiscent of the Holocaust painted on a bizarre display in Harvard Yard that seemed to tacitly equate Zionism with Nazism. They were disturbed when this very newspaper’s Editorial Boardendorsedthe Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel movement, a cause thatmanyAmerican Jews consider to be either mostly antisemitic or to have some antisemitic supporters. And they were scared when they discovered an online interactive map thatdocumentedthe locations of dozens of Boston Jewish organizations in what feels like an apparent “how-to” guide for the hate-crime-curious. Now, hosting a speaker on this campus who seemingly flirts with antisemitism — especially one who has appeared to endorse the use of violence in some cases — makes Jewish students feel even less safe. We know what happens when we allow public, antisemitic calls for violence. For one of us, it resulted in his family being murdered in the Holocaust. For the other, it led a gunman to commit a shooting in his majority-Jewish hometown, forcing him to pull his elderly grandparents away from the roar of bullets he was sure were coming their way. We Jews, personal victims of antisemitic attacks, can’t help but wonder: Why would a campus event be any different? By inviting El-Kurd, the PSC has demonstrated what appears to be a disturbing degree of carelessness and flippancy about antisemitism. We believe they should invite speakers whose views are constructive and lead to dialogue, not those who lead to Jewish students feeling unsafe. When an individual engages in hateful and incendiary behavior, we all have the obligation to speak out, or, at the very least, not invite them into our community. Harvard must send a strong message to its students by condemning El-Kurd ahead of his speech. They must also carefully review whether the PSC violated any student organization guidelines by providing a platform for El-Kurd to promote his views, which we find abhorrent. To our peers, we ask that you not attend an event featuring a speaker whose language has displayed antisemitic undertones and seemingly exhibited comfort with violence. We are dismayed to see our peers bring El-Kurd to speak to our campus. We find their willingness to invite such a noxious figure into our midst appalling. Thou shalt not stand idly by. Jacob M.

stanforddaily_2022_6,"On homecoming weekend, the Stanford Class of 2017 returned for our five year reunion. Before we graduated, hundreds of ussigned a pledgethrough Fossil Free Stanford to withhold donations until Stanford fully divests and dissociates from fossil fuels. Homecoming weekend reminded us how far our alma mater still needs to go. While we were students, we engaged in one of the largest campus movements in Stanford’s history: an organized, passionate, lengthy mobilization to push Stanford to divest from fossil fuels. In 2015, more than one hundred studentsparticipatedina week-long sit-inoutside Former President Hennessy’s office in advance of the UN Climate Conference in Paris. Over the years, Fossil Free Stanfordhas continuedto call on the university to live into its values and embody its commitment to future generations. While Stanford diddivest from coalin 2014, it still lags behind other institutionslike Harvard,DartmouthandPrincetonby continuing to hold other fossil fuel assets and associate with fossil fuel companies. The science is clear: Fossil fuel use is causing an unprecedented increase in the atmosphere’s concentration of greenhouse gases. The resulting climate and environmental impacts are undeniable and painful, particularly for frontline communities around the world — communities that many Stanford students and alumni hail from. Stanford’s continued investment in and association with fossil fuel companies also stand in stark contrast to the mission of the new Doerr School of Sustainability to “create a future where humans and nature thrive in concert and in perpetuity.” Stanford’s decision to continue acceptingresearch funding from fossil fuel companies through 14 industry affiliate programsmakes a mockery of the School’s mission and hampers the University’s ability to support real climate solutions. By continuing to accept fossil fuel funding, Stanford is aiding and abetting fossil fuel exploration and extraction and pushing research towards false climate “solutions” that benefit fossil fuel companies instead of communities. The continued investment in fossil fuels sacrifices Stanford’s credibility and integrity in the eyes of its students, faculty, alumni, policymakers and the public.

rice_thresher_2022_24,"ByRiley Barker9/6/22 11:13pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Shortly after arriving at Rice for the fall semester, I noticed a piece of purple paper peeking out beneath my room’s door frame. “An app just for Rice Students!” announced the cardstock. The ad was for Fizz, a social media app launched by two Stanford University students my equal in age at their university just one year ago. Wary but curious, I downloaded the app. It was, in a word, unpleasant. Users of social media like Twitter and Reddit have come to accept the daily buzz of thoughts that probably should have stayed thoughts, questionable quips and the general chatter that together lay the foundation of the short-form internet. But Fizz is different. Fizz is right next to us. The closeness of Fizz is what gives the app its gravity; it’s also the reason our community needs to detach itself from it. The draw of an app like Fizz, andthere have been many before it,is that it is built like a digital pub. Each university is a unique sociocultural petri dish; Fizz exploits this by requiring users to sign up with their university email address while, critically, keeping its users anonymous. In theory, the system ensures the safety of an online community by sheltering Fizz users from bad actors outside their university’s borders while simultaneously encouraging a free and open discourse within them. But what it means in practice is that posts that rate the attractiveness of women at Rice on a sliding scale or comments like “I definitely expected this app to have more nudes and dark secrets” may have been sent out from a phone on the other side of your classroom. Maybe even beside you. There is a troubling darkness to this version of college – internet reality. Fizz’s proximity and familiarity, combined with its promised anonymity, breeds a new kind of toxic potential in cyberspace. Hyper-focused bullying, harassment, public ridicule and social ostracization represent just a fraction of the possible fallout from an app explicitly tailored to the follies of young adults in the loosely moderated forum-in-miniature. I recognize that by writing this article, I will become a target of that type of vitriol. As aforementioned, Fizz is not the first app of its kind. In fact,it’s not even the first to capture the attention of Rice students. In the last decade, dozens of apps have been built and launched by debatably well-intentioned, enterprising college students with a knack for code. All of them have attempted to make a centralized platform to socialize – masquerade-ball style – in the digital milieu. Almost all have died off shortly thereafter in the wake of hate-speech or harassment scandals. Facebook, being one of the first, seems to have been the singular exception to the rule. Fizz, however, has a layer of polish that similar apps have not perfected: competition. There is a leaderboard to aspire to: students with the most upvotes are ranked by popularity. Social media “karma” isn’t new, but Fizz’s exact model of competition is, and it’s wildly effective. The interface is simple but intentional. The purple and white color scheme snags our tap-Instagram-reflex while Fizz’s bold sans-serif font choice gives the app an energy that borrows more from Slack or Monday.com than subreddits or the Twitterverse. Taken together, Fizz has its addictive dial cranked to the maximum. Generation Z and, increasingly, Generation Alpha, are the first humans to be fully embedded within the still-emerging social media landscape. For better or worse, TikTok fame, double taps and daily BeReals have become intrinsic parts of our shared and disparate identities. What we should not and cannot allow is the debasing of our closest communities. As it concerns Rice, we must strive to promote a healthy campus discourse, resisting the temptation to hollow out and diminish our generally open, progressive, embracing and friendly culture by exposing Rice’s repressed underbelly. We have to leave alone our cynical and disingenuous impulses in the pursuit of a Rice common culture that is built on respect, inclusivity, diversity, both intellectual and personal, and compassion. Fizz will fizzle out eventually, but what remains must be a commitment to building a positive and accepting campus. In the aftermath of a pandemic, one of the loneliest periods of recent human history, we should spend less time anonymously toeing the line between what is shareable and what is not and instead devote our energy, online and off, to supporting and caring for what comprises the wonderful and inspiring core of this community: each other. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

Those challenges should be approached with unique intentionality instead of a cookie-cutter perspective that all problems are created equal. Leaders must have a vision. Politicians have a reputation.

crimson_2022_125,"Two years ago, I was in the same position many of you are in now: admitted but unsure if Harvard was the right place for me. As I weighed financial, geographic, and academic factors, I remember waiting for a sign that there was something different, something better, about Harvard. I thought that I found that sign during a Virtual Visitas Q&A. Amidst the standard replies to questions about food, concentrations, and classes, one answer stood out to me: When asked what their favorite part of Harvard was, a current student enthusiastically replied “the people.” This answer tipped the scales and instilled the confidence I needed to accept the offer of admission. But after spending two years at Harvard, I have lost faith in that simple answer. During my freshman year, I always assumed that “the people” referred to my peers. I imagined that I would be accepted into a supportive, accepting community of learners where every person is pushed to be a better thinker. In reality, I joined a hypercompetitive, toxic, and superficial community. Harvard students love to compare themselves to each other. Exam scores, summer plans, leadership positions, and even the number of colors on your Google Calendar are all fair game — and obviously, every student wants to win. Harvard’sgrind cultureis impossible to escape, and pausing to take a breath from your four to five classes and handful of organizations just means that you’re falling behind. Of course, the feeling that you’ll never measure up to your peers is why many students struggle withimposter syndrome. These culture problems would be made easier to bear with a strong group of friends, but so many relationships at Harvard are transactional. People interact to get a project or a problem set done, and when the work ends, the relationship often does as well. Combining these issues withblatant student racismandtransphobia, it’s pretty clear that the students are not the high point of Harvard. Maybe then, I reasoned, “the people” that make Harvard special are professors and administrators. Harvard’s professors are one-of-a-kind minds whose work has redefined their fields. Harvard administrators lead what is often regarded as one of the best universities in the world. Even if the students fall short, these adults must measure up. Scandal after scandal has shown me otherwise. Some instructors use their knowledge to advanceracist agendas. Others use their power tosexually harassstudents while the administration idly stands by. A lack of institutional support has proved common. This past year, graduate studentscalledfor non-discrimination protection and raises adjusted for inflation, leading to a three-day strike — and it was only after eight months of negotiation and a second strike threat that the administration and the graduate student union finallyreachedan agreement. Additionally, although Harvard undergraduates have significantly higher rates of anxiety and depression than the national average, Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Servicesfail to meet this demand. I’m not sharing my recollection of the past two years to convince you that the people of Harvard are exceedingly bad. I would just argue that they are exceedingly average. Toxic culture, apathy, abuse of power, racism, and sexism exist everywhere that people exist. The Harvard community inevitably reproduces these issues. We aren’t better, and we certainly aren’t immune. The word “Harvard” carries with it a certain social weight, supported by billions of dollars and hundreds of years of history. But, truly, this power is undeserved. Before you accept (or decline the offer of admission, you need to come to terms with this reality. Regardless of where you attend college, be ready to hold your peers, professors, and administrators accountable. Be selective with your friends, and keep in mind that their beliefs, attitudes, and choices affect you. Hold onto the people and groups who bring you joy. If you were to ask me now what my favorite part of Harvard is, I would say the HUDS oatmeal raisin cookies because I no longer know how to answer the question in any other way. I hope that in the next two years, my answer will change. Welcome to Harvard, Class of 2026. A transformative college experience awaits you. Libby E.

wildcat_arizona_2022_15,"“Body Image. The subjective concept of one’s physical appearance based on self-observation and the reactions of others.” by Charlotte Astrid/Creative Commons (CC BY 2.0 Social media platforms hold a lot of power. The posts individuals choose to share can reach millions of people and can have a large impact on those who come across them. TikTok is a social media platform that plays a large role in the everyday lives of more than1 billionworld wide users, to call the platform popular is an understatement. With all the videos that flood TikTok, all users have their own personalized feed or “For You Page” where they can endlessly scroll through content. Through our never-ending scrolling on the app, we have the chance of running into some of the toxic communities that are within it. TikTok states that theirmissionis “to inspire creativity and bring joy,” but some videos that are shared on the platform do quite the opposite. RELATED:OPINION: ‘The Yak is Back’: Revival of anonymous social media platform brings negativity to campus One toxic community that can be found on TikTok is one that promotes unhealthy eating and relationships with food. Although it is not always intentional, a handful of the videos on TikTok are promoting and triggering disordered eating and unhealthy relationships with food and our bodies. The more we see this type of content, the more normalized it becomes. According to theNational Eating Disorder Association, 20 million women and 10 million men struggle with eating disorders. We never know who around us is struggling and how social media content will affect those who come across it. A TikTok trend in particular that promotes dangerous relationships with food are “what I eat in a day videos.” These short daily food diaries focus heavily on calorie intake and eating as little as possible each day. What I eat in a day videos often show restricting and unhealthy diets, even diets that involve eating as low as 800 calories per day. RELATED:OPINION: Gaining the ‘freshman 15′ isn’t something to be worried about in college There are also videos showing “healthy food swaps.” In reality these swaps aren’t always healthy. Swapping foods and labeling foods as “good” versus “bad” options is not a healthy mindset to have. Food is fuel and no matter what we are eating we are providing our bodies with nutrients. While TikTok has made regulations and has tried to take precautions to not allow these types of videos, there are ways for them to slip through the cracks. If users on the platform look up the hashtag #anorexia, #eatingdisorder, and #thinspo they are then directed to the Suicide Prevention Lifeline. However, making searches such as #skinnycheck will bring up a handful of dangerous videos. Social media is powerful. In our society it is common for individuals to spend hours each day on social media platforms. As we go about our day scrolling through TikTok to pass the time, what’s important is that we don’t promote the dangerous trends that flood the platform.

ubyssey_2022_33,"March 22, 2022 Written byYotam Ronen When I started my PhD back in 2018, I went on every single campus tour I could find. Many of those tours discussed theReconciliation Pole— and rightfully so. Some of them also highlighted theSopron Gate, a monument donated by alumni of the Hungarian Forestry School in Sopron (or the Sopron University of Forestry in Hungary to the UBC Faculty of Forestry. This beautiful gate was donated to commemoratean act of solidarityperformed by the UBC community towards students and faculty in Hungary, some 65 years ago. Following the 1956 revolution in Hungary, students and faculty at the Sopron University of Forestry faced the violence of the Soviet army as theyfired on protesters. In September 1957, at the invitation and support of UBC, 14 faculty and 200 students from the Hungarian Sopron University of Forestry came to UBC to continue their work and studies, following persecution in their home country. UBC lent a hand and helped those in need. Not only did our university invite Hungarian refugees to continue their studies at UBC, but offered them many accommodations and forms of material support. Their story is one that we at UBC can be proud of. Today, Ukraine is suffering a brutal war as Russian soldiers invade the country,performing horrifying injustices, murdering innocent civilians and creating more than 2 million refugees. As we look on from the safety of North America, people in Ukraine face war, terrorism and death. We can’t choose indifference in the face of such atrocities. And yet, many of us feel powerless and sit hoping that our leaders do the right thing. At UBC, we are in a unique position. We don’t have to stay indifferent. We don’t have to wait for leaders. UBC can learn from its own past and do the right thing. It can offer subsidies, housing, funding and enrolment to students, staff and faculty from Ukrainian institutions, on its own, or through programs likeScholars at Riskand theNew University in Exile Consortium. Some institutions, like Brown University, have already donethat. As thefederal government takes stepsto create avenues for immigration for Ukrainian refugees, UBC can be at the forefront of a humanitarian effort to secure the future of many of these refugees. This is doable, today, and needs only the willingness and initiative of university leadership. Many say that the current acts of solidarity with Ukraine constitute a racist double-standard, and ask where those acts were for refugees from other war-torn regions, such as theMiddle East.This is an important critique, and here on campus, we might also ask why it is that UBC talks about human rights while taking limited steps to alleviate the suffering of others where it can. We might also point out thatstudents are far better at responding to global crises than university leadership. These are crucial conversations that we should have, yet they are not reasons to stay indifferent. Rather, they are opportunities to start doing the right thing and hold UBC’s leadership accountable so that similar initiatives may be implemented in the future. More than 60 years after their arrival in Canada, the choice to help those in need in Hungary proved to be a success. Many of the students who came from Sapron continued to graduate school,and many made a considerable impact in the field of forestry.While our shared legacy is something to be proud of, it is not an excuse to rest on our laurels. Rather, it is proof that we can and must lend a helping hand. While UBC has offered moderate support — whether intuition deferrals for Russian UBC studentsorprogramming for affected students— and a potentially-harmfulsymbolic decision to cut ties with Russian institutionsis currently being debated by Senate, these measures are few and far-between. UBC can and should offer subsidies and funding schemes to incoming and current students at all levels of study, tuition deferrals and exemptions, housing opportunities for incoming Ukrainian students and their families, support with immigration applications and counselling services to help incoming and current students cope with the traumatic effects of this war. This is a short and incomplete list of things we can do. However, this list shows that we can help, and that our help can have a huge impact. Our shared history shows that it is possible.

crimson_2022_93,"I can already imagine the faces. Crinkled noses, slack-mouthed gapes, eyebrows drawing together in frustration — or maybe worry. Three lines creep across their foreheads, accompanied by a nervous scratch of the jaw, a bite of the lip, or a clasping of sweaty hands. Perhaps I’m at a restaurant reserving a table for two. Or I’m at Annenberg, exchanging numbers with someone I just met. No matter the circumstance, my new name will warrant confusion to all who dare speak it. The same words will inevitably present themself: Could you repeat that? On New Year’s Eve of this year, I printed out Form CJP 27, got it notarized at the local Commerce Bank, and tenderly placed it in a manila folder alongside a certified, long-form copy of my birth certificate and a CVS money order of $180. One last deliberation, one final breath, and I slipped out of the house without telling a soul, taking the family car through miles of Central Mass. woodland to file for a name change. The process to turn Ryan Nguyễn into Ryan Đoàn-Nguyễn had begun. Ryan Đoàn-Nguyễn. It’s quite the mouthful for the average English speaker, bound to make taking attendance a hell of an experience. But when I stepped into the biting December air after an hour at the Worcester Probate and Family Court, a gust of wind collapsing onto my cheek, Ryan Đoàn-Nguyễn was what I shouted into the skies, and it felt perfect. I felt like a new hire entering the workplace of their dream job. Like a housewife leaving her marriage after years of discontent. I was standing at the steps of a reimagined future — an ocean of possibility. New name. New year. New me. Yet every time I tell people about my name change, they never fail to remind me of the pains of hyphenated life. Think of the struggle with medical documents and plane tickets, the computer systems and insurance, points out my father, with the economical attitude of an engineer. Imagine spelling your name over the phone, and consider the time it’ll take for your Harvard records and email address to reflect the change, informs my academic advisor. We already butcher your last name, joke my friends, a second part will be impossible. Believe me, though. I’ve run through every scenario, every pain and troubling obstacle, a thousand times over. This name change was never a spur-of-the-moment decision. It was the culmination of months of dreaming as I rummaged through articles of others who’d done it themselves, countless hours researchingmass.govto understand Massachusetts name change law inside and out, and one too many sleepless nights spent conducting mental cost-benefit analysis on the tiles of my ceiling. It was the apex of head-scratching reflection and the jolting realization that what I had carried for 19 years through this world would no longer be the same. Still, the concerned relative asks: Why on Earth am I making my already difficult name even harder? The love I have for my family is paramount. Đoàn, my current middle name, is my mother’s name. It takes me to the handbuilt house of Ông Ngoại, my grandfather, and scorching summers spent in West Coast sun. It brings me back to eight aunts and one spirited uncle, their laughter spilling through the screen door into sticky evening air as we reset the mahjong table for our twentieth round. It carries me to youthful moments in the company of twelve cousins — chasing geckos together across stucco walls; sledding down grassy hills on tacky pieces of cardboard; sharing bites of backyard-grown mangosteen, soursop, and dragon’s eye; and placing bets with dollar bills as we hover cross-legged around a bầu cua cá cọp mat. Đoàn ties me to Bà Ngoại, my grandmother, who inspires the life I want to lead. Đoàn is the two of us conversing into the thick of night to the hums of crickets and cicadas, her spinning tales with that signature fierce aura about her. Đoàn is her chronicling the murder of her mother, the dreams of American liberty, the spine-chilling moments she hid under floorboards with ten children, breaths held as the men above searched for traitors. Đoàn is the South China Sea’s sharp sting when they reached Pulau Bidong and capsized the overcrowded fishing boat. Đoàn is refusing to be pushed back into the deadly waves. Đoàn is equal parts joyous and painful. Đoàn is messy. Đoàn is crooked. Đoàn is home. And there’s a deliberateness to the changing of my name — in challenging the fated, predetermined, and powerful — that imbues me with a newfound sense of agency. Perhaps bringing my mother to the forefront of my name constitutes just the slightest act of resistance against patriarchal, patrilineal, and patrilocal Vietnamese customs. Maybe systemic change can come from forcing people to stumble on yet another foreign syllable in this country where my language once wasn’t welcome. The satisfaction might be due in part to my silly desire to be the only one on campus with my name (yes, there’s another Ryan Nguyễn in Harvard’s Class of ’25 . All I know is that my new name feels right, and that’s enough of a reason for me. A name is the one passed-down thing you forever carry with you. Should your house burn down or your belongings disappear, you still have your name. So, throw all the hurdles you want at me. Mispronounce me as many times as you want. I’m making my name mine, and I’m wearing it with honor. Ryan H. Đoàn-Nguyễn, ’25, a Crimson News comper, lives in Matthews Hall."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_24,"Rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West,announcedon Feb. 17 that his new album “Donda 2” would only be accessible through his Stem Player, which isa pocket-sizeddevice that functions like a speaker. In an Instagram post announcing the decision, he reasons that the music industry pays its artists “just 12% of the money the industry makes,” and that “it’s time to free music from this oppressive system.” By billing the Stem Player as a trailblazing product that can remedy the issues with the modern music industry, Ye implies that he hopes for his Stem Player to overtake music streaming giants like Spotify and Apple Music. However, that will not happen. In fact, Ye’s decision to attach a hefty $200 price tag to the Stem Player is unbelievably exploitative towards fans. Because of this high entry price, many fans have beendiscouragedfrom purchasing it, making it so artists will likely not benefit from releasing their music on the Stem Player, either. However, Ye does make one point – it’s true that major platforms like Spotify do not pay artists fairly. The UK Parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS department released areportwhere they concluded that “even successful artists are seeing pitiful returns from streaming” as streaming services paypoor ratesand record labels take a disproportionately strong majority of each song’s profits. It’s likely that Ye’s exclusive Stem Player was not motivated by a genuine desire to offer a solution to these problems, but rather a desire to fill his own pockets. Ye described the Stem Player as “his own platform,” and failed to articulate how it would benefit other artists. He hasn’t provided information on if or how artists will receive proceeds from Stem Player sales and streams either. He wasquick to point outthat the Stem Player garnered over $2.2 million in sales upon its first day of release, though. That’s a lot of money, but Ye also demonstrated that many fans are being priced out — only about 8,000 Stem Players were sold in that timeframe. There’s millions more people who want to listen to Ye’s music, and thepiratingof “Donda 2” has already begun. Tracks from the new album can be found on popular sites like Twitter, Reddit and SoundCloud as well. Evidently, fans don’t want to buy the Stem Player at such an inflated price, and they have no reason to when the same tools and songs can be easily accessible for free. The Stem Player’s low sales and piracy issues have already proven that it is not the groundbreaking product Ye built it up to be. In his initial announcement of the Stem Player, Ye also proclaimed that “it’s time to take control” of the music industry that is admittedly stacked against artists. According to Ye, the release of “Donda 2” on his Stem Player was supposed to be a landmark event, yet he fell far below his own call to meet the moment. As of publication, he has released many tracks from “Donda 2” on the Stem Player, and fans rightfullycriticizedhim as many songs sound unfinished. Ye is no stranger to revising his work — his 2016 album “The Life of Pablo” wasupdatedseveral times after its release until Aug. 2018. It’s bad enough to release an unfinished project, but Ye is disrespecting his fans by pushing them to pay $200 for an incomplete album. The Stem Player can also perform remarkable functions like isolating thevocalsof any given track and giving users the capability toremixsongs. It might be worthwhile for some fans, but overall, it’s not going to revolutionize the music industry like Ye wants it to. Ye’s promotion of his Stem Player came in the midst of an incredibly disturbing barrage of — now-mostly deleted —harassment and threatspublicly directed towards comedian Pete Davidson. Ye has a massive platform and influence, and he continues to misuse it. If he can drive Davidson off of Instagram, he can make real progress towards shifting the power back to the artists without overcharging fans, like by promoting more reasonable streaming services likeBandcamp. Bandcamp is built on the premise of justly compensating artists for their work, paying artists or their labels around “80-85%” of their proceeds. Fans generally have to pay around$2 per track, with more value added in purchasinga full album. It’s a relatively small price to pay to directly support one’s favorite artists, especially in comparison to the $200 Stem Player whose benefits for other artists have yet to be established. However, “Donda 2” should not be released on Bandcamp for the same reason it should not be released on the Stem Player — Ye doesn’t need to take his fanbase’s money. If Ye wants to make substantial change while doing what’s best for his fans, he should endorse platforms like Bandcamp and make “Donda 2” accessible to everybody by putting it on major music streaming platforms as he did with the first “Donda.” Ultimately, it’s clear that Ye’s Stem Player is nothing more than a cash grab which Ye is falsely representing as a useful product and a show of his noble intentions. It is atrocious that Ye chooses to engage in such harmful behavior and is disingenuously promoting his Stem Player to capitalize on the media frenzy that he’s created. As Ye would say, “no one man should have all that power,” and especially not a man such as himself who uses his status for destructive and selfish means instead of for the greater good.

wildcat_arizona_2022_42,"An illustration of a film executive using diversity as a selling point by Emilie Marie Cuevas. With each year of growing older, I have noticed the evolution of inclusivity in media. Most of the television I watched in my younger years consisted of all white casts; there were no gay Disney characters, and I certainly never saw anyone with a disability in a mainstream acting role. The exclusivity went beyond TV and film, reaching advertisement industries, modeling industries and news reporting media as well. Almost everyone who was anyone fit the blueprint: white, fit and straight. Today, things are different, and for a good reason. Netflix especially elevated the game when it started releasing original series and casting minorities in major roles — Black, brown, Asian, queer and those with disabilities. Soon, other companies followed with ad campaigns promoting inclusivity. Unfortunately, most of these, like the infamousPepsiadvertisement, were embarrassing and offensive. “Wokeness” became so loud and so trendy, and I now wonder if it has lost its authenticity. A large portion of Generation Z is passionate about fostering a diverse and just future, and TV and film executives recognize that fact. They are using that ambition, casting all sorts of backgrounds and employing their idea of empowering storylines, just to rack up views and, most importantly, dollars. Unless it is imperative to the storyline, the fact that a character is a minority does not need to be announced. Their narrative should instead take its course as though they are on a level playing field with the others — there is no need to make their physical identifiers a theatrical exaggeration, while everyone else goes on living without being singled out for their appearance or identity. There are, of course, programs that do execute the progressive perspective artfully. In my eyes, if creators really wanted to use their mediums as a way to advocate for diversity, they would present it with subtlety. For example, in some of my favorite animated films such as “Coco” (2017 and “Kubo and the Two Strings” (2016 , foreign cultures are brought to the big screen seamlessly without the need to throw the “woke perspective” in the viewer’s face. Then there are shows that achieve nothing but the reinforcement of stereotypes. Netflix may have been one of the trailblazers for progressive TV, but they disgrace that effort with overplayed scandals between gay teenagers or between a defiant brown girl and her strict parents, which have not only been exhausted but have no true intention of wokeness. Nadia’s character on the Spanish drama “Elite” is a great example of this. As a hijabi woman in a primarily white school, “Elite” gave Nadia the most stereotypical storyline and identity. Asone articlepointed out, at the onset, viewers would appreciate the representation she provides, but making her the token Muslim girl who struggles between her traditional family and the typical teenage lifestyle of the West is a step backward. Rather than having her find peace with her true identity, she does a complete 180 by removing her hijab and getting swept up in the sex, drugs and rock and roll of the high school in “Elite.” Not only does this narrative ruin the opportunity for character depth or growth beyond her outward-facing identity, it also reinforces the common misconceptions that one, the removal of the hijab is freeing for every woman and two, that freedom is only found in the material indulgences that everybody else partakes in. The same weak inclusion of diversity applies toHBO’s rebootof the classic “Gossip Girl” series. To me, the new show’s primary focus is diversity and it tries so hard to represent the society we live in today, but ultimately ends up overcompensating. I am all for a diverse cast, and the reboot achieves that on the surface with the casting of two Black female leads, Asians, Hispanics and queer characters. But, again, most of the subplots are completely mediocre at best, meaning the show loses any potential for effective advocacy. One of the bi-curious characters in the reboot, Aki, is caught in a struggle concerning him and his girlfriend’s failing relationship. He eventually cheats on her in an attempt to better understand his sexuality. With this, “Gossip Girl” makes it seem like it’s normal for closeted folks to cheat and lie, which is an outdated assumption at this point. Aki and his girlfriend, Aubrey, later realize what they’re missing is a bit of polyamory with the addition of their best friend Max. Max might have the most depth out of all the characters in the show, but his character is handed whatNPRcalls, “one of the most awful and irresponsible tropes to ever be duplicated across high-school shows to the point where it is also a cliché.” This trope would, of course, be the student-teacher affair Max is involved in with a male teacher at school, which only further scandalizes sexual curiosity and identity searching itself for the sake of views. RELATED:OPINION: Give these UA artists a listen to freshen up your playlist The drama surrounding diverse characters is all for the views. Diverse characters should simply be integrated within the film and TV industry — something extremely influential on our mindsets — if we want any chance at normalizing their diversity rather than alienating those that break the norm. Luca Guadagnino’s “Call Me by Your Name” (2017 follows the love story of two young men in 1983. I personally enjoy it for its poetic interpretation of mundane life. And, when drama presents itself, it is subdued, mellow and realistic — nothing like the tumultuous plots of recent TV. What goes unnoticed about a movie like “Call Me by Your Name” or “Brokeback Mountain” (2005 is that it takes on a plotline that any sort of cast could attain and it does not depend on the appearance or identity of characters; their love story is not special because the titular characters are gay, rather, it is special because they are meant to be together. Another great example of normalizing queer relationships is Jules and Rue from “Euphoria.” For one,Jules’ backgroundas a transgender girl is so well executed and so smoothly introduced. A reenactment of her childhood struggle with gender dysphoria and mental illness illustrates the hardship that many transitioning individuals resonate with. The story gives Jules depth and places her in an accurate, yet still original scenario for a trans woman, rather than a stereotypical one, which may have made her the punchline of a joke or the only girl that can’t find love. As Jules’s and Rue’s relationship develops, there is never any mention of her transgender identity again. She is just a regular girl doing regular things (relative to the norm of Euphoria high schoolers , which seems like the best way to dispel homophobia and transphobia through TV. As viewers, it is important to note the stereotyping that TV. can often normalize. While the industry has made it a long way, even since the time I was a child in the 2000s, there is evidently a lot of room for improvement. TV and film executives should do their part as powerful disseminators of entertainment to implement diversity from an authentic standpoint rather than a greedy and haphazard one. As easily impressionable viewers, we must consider what side the show or movie we are watching comes from to avoid blind support. Let’s give our future the help it deserves by ensuring that genuine diversity is protected and promoted.

stanforddaily_2022_57,"Abolish Stanford is an autonomous formation fighting for police abolition and total liberation at Stanford University and across the peninsula. Through direct action, county-level advocacy, political education and base-building, we are committed to defunding the police and reinvesting resources towards community and institutions that actually keep us safe.The group’s members have asked to remain anonymous for fear of university retaliation. On Thursday, March 26, the Santa Clara County Community Correction and Law Enforcement Monitoring Committee (CCLEM metto consider recommendations relating to the Sheriff’s Office Military Equipment Use Policy. UnderAssembly Bill 481,law enforcement agencies are required to receive approval from their local governing body for the acquisition and continued use of military equipment. Among the military items and uses that the Sheriff’s Office wants approved are: continued use of 280 Colt AR-15 and other assault and sniper rifles, a new $465,000 robot (on top of the three robots already in inventory and unrestricted use of “less lethal” (i.e. rubber bullets and chemical munitions, according to the meetingagenda. This list does not include the inventory within the Stanford University Department of Public Safety’s (SUDPS possession.According to the agenda,SUDPS alone has 32 Colt AR-15 rifles and eight Defense Technology 40mm Launchers for “less lethal” munitions, among other items. As the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC pointed out during the meeting, these types of militarized equipment do not keep communities safe: they exacerbate the threat posed to Black and Brown communities due to already existing disparities in policing, and they do not keep communities safe. Studies show that they fail toreduce crimeand/orattacks on police, but that theydoincreasetheamount of violencecommunities face at thehands of police. The AFSC also pointed out that the Sheriff’s Office proposed Military Equipment Use Policy violates state and county law.Assembly Bill 48prohibits the use of kinetic energy projectiles (i.e. “less lethal” munitions and chemical agents to disperse any assembly, protest or demonstration except under very specific circumstances (such as threat to life or of severe bodily injury . And perhaps most importantly, the Military Equipment Use Policy places few to no restrictions on its use of militarized equipment. There are no explicit prohibitions on use of any of these items, nor are there real limitations (most uses are defined as “including, but not limited to” . Despite these deficiencies and community concerns, the Sheriff’s Office argued that this military equipment is needed to respond to incidents like the 2021 VTA shooting in San Jose. Indeed,police often invokemass shootings as a justification for their militarization, as well as their very existence. Unfortunately, in the past few weeks, we’ve seen multiple times just how empty the promise of safety through militarized police forces truly is. In Uvalde, TX, a gunman killed 19 children and two adults at a local elementary school. It’s difficult to imagine a more disastrous police response: the gunman was inside the school for around80 minutes,roughly50 of whichinvolved 19 police officers waiting inside a school hallway, refusing to confront the lone gunman. Federal marshals and Uvalde Police Department officersreserved their violencefor family members urging action: one woman was briefly handcuffed, a father was thrown to the ground by an officer, another was pepper-sprayed and another was tasered. Meanwhile, students trapped inside made at leastseven 911 callsbegging police — who they could hear right outside — for help. Ultimately, it took a separate law enforcement agencyreceiving a key from a school janitorbefore the gunman was killed and children were able to leave. The knee-jerk response to tragedies like this is to call for more police funding. But that would make a mockery of the people who lost loved ones in recent weeks in the face of police incompetence. Uvalde spends40% of its budgeton police and hasmore than doubledthe amount it spends on school policing since 2017, from roughly $200,000 to $435,000. In Buffalo, NY, a 911 dispatcherhung up the phoneon an employee trapped in the grocery store attacked by a white supremacist gunman. New York Cityincreasedthe amount of law enforcement dedicated to the subway system by 250 officers last May, only for theNYPD to failto prevent the attack or apprehend the gunman. We havedecades’ worthof similar examples of police failure in the context of mass shootings. We also know that in the two years since George Floyd was murdered, police have gone to kill over2,000 more people, or aboutthree people per day.Whether we want to admit it or not,we are living in a death cult, in no small part due to this country’s obsession with police. As writer, lawyer and activist Derecka Purnell writes in “Becoming Abolitionists,” “S tructural violence, like militarism and policing, can create and shape interpersonal violence, like assaults, murders and mass shootings . . . . Plainly put, when the federal government uses law enforcement and the military to control concentrated wealth, property and natural resources, they condition everyday people to accept the violence, replicate it or rebel against it.” We must be among those who rebel against it. We must work to end policing, war and militarization here and around the globe. And there’s plenty we can do locally to be part of this struggle: A better world is possible, but not while the state increases its investment in death and destruction, at the expense of community resources and care. We cannot allow these recent, devastating tragedies to be used as an excuse to expand the militarized police state. We need abolition now.

thetech_mit_2022_8,"Italicized quotes presented below were anonymously collected in our survey. The term “Asian/American” is used to include both people who identify as Asian American and Asian only, such as international students. A significant number of us are hurting. We are MIT Asian American Initiative’s mental health team. Through these past several semesters, we’ve regularly hosted discussion circles to explore topics in a culturally safe space for Asian/Americans, touching on subjects such as imposter syndrome, body dysmorphia, and general anxiety. While we are grateful for the support that we have been able to provide one another, we can only do so much for one another while also dealing with our own mental health challenges. Time and time again, we hear from our friends, our neighbors, and our classmates about their mental health struggles, fighting countless battles without professional support. What are the barriers at MIT that prevent Asian/American students from receiving the support they need? What can MIT do better? To gain insight on these questions, we called out to our campus’s Asian/American students via an anonymous mental health survey emailed to dorm mailing lists and Asian cultural clubs, where we collected 85 responses over the course of December 2021 and January 2022. Although this number is small in comparison to the entire Asian/American population at MIT, it is imperative that we listen to the voices of those who are struggling with the current resources in place. Here is what our respondents have to say. Ethnic representation and cultural competence “It’s incredibly important to me that the mental health professional understands my culture because a lot of the things I want to talk about are related to and rooted in my culture.” A growing choir of healthcare and counseling professionals and clients are calling for more cultural competence in the clinic. To be culturally competent means that providers are continuously introspecting and building awareness on their personal biases, interactional patterns, and value systems given the culture they were brought up in. Only after a personal journey can therapists begin to approach conversations related to race with their clients, according to Dr.Helen Neville, professor of educational psychology and African American Studies at the University of Illinois. Without cultural competency, therapists may unintentionally push away the very clients they intend to support through a lack of cultural understanding or even perpetuation of microaggressions. “Sometimes when I worked with therapists who were not of my racial or ethnic background, my concerns seemed trivial or ridiculous to them.” TheAmerican Psychiatric Associationstates that Asian Americans are three times less likely to seek mental health services than Caucasians, which means it is ever-crucial that once Asian/Americans have reached the clinic, we are uplifted by mental health professionals, rather than made to feel uncomfortable. In our survey, a large majority of respondents indicated the importance of having therapists that share their ethnic background (70% and are culturally competent (86% . Respondents noted that cultural familiarity increases therapists’ empathy and understanding of sources of mental health issues. Asian/Americans face unique struggles, often including but not limited to: family obligations based on cultural values; difficulty balancing various cultures; and facing discrimination and stereotypes such as the “model minority” myth, which assumes innate perfection and subservience from Asian/Americans. “I’ve come to realize that a lot of my issues have roots in my culture. I’m still working through a lot of race-related and culture-related issues from the past, and I’ve had a hard time opening up about some things in an honest way to white or non-Asian therapists. I just wasn’t able to speak as candidly about some experiences (even to non-Asian therapists of color . It took me a really long time to find an Asian therapist in the Boston area who was also taking appointments. I wish there were more Asian therapists at MIT, considering we’re not a minority race in the student body.” Many respondents noted feeling more comfortable speaking with a therapist with a similar ethnicity, where shared experiences can increase therapists’ ability to empathize. Students do not want to deal with the burden of explaining their cultural background to their therapists, facing trivialization or misunderstanding of identity-related struggles and receiving ignorant commentary. “Going to a predominantly white institution has caused issues like facing racism, feeling ugly, and being tokenized at times. I want a therapist that can help me navigate this world, and I haven’t felt comfortable opening up to white therapists because I’m afraid they will think that I am insulting them or being too sensitive.” The unfortunate reality is that the demand for therapists of color does not meet the supply. In 2015, while38%of the U.S. population is people of color, only 14% of psychiatrists in the U.S. are people of color, with just 5% of psychiatrists identifying as Asian. For MIT’s most recently admitted undergraduate class of 2025,41%of students are Asian American. Out of the 28 current care providers listed onMIT Mental Health & Counselingservices’ website, fewer than 15% are representative of the Asian/American community (as of January 26, 2022 . Out of nine current deans atStudent Support Services, none appear to be Asian/American. Even with the few Asian therapists at MIT Mental Health, some survey respondents have experienced challenges with continuity of care. “I got super lucky this year to have an Indian-American woman therapist who was able to help me with a lot of conflicts and issues with my family that a white or non-Indian therapist would never have been able to help me with. I feel like I was finally getting better after being frustrated with white therapists before. But she left MIT because she wasn’t getting paid enough and was being given too many patients because MIT Mental Health was understaffed so she wasn’t getting to work with patients in-depth as she likes to. And because her private practice doesn’t take my insurance, now I don’t have a therapist anymore, and I feel like I ll never find anyone else as good as her at MIT Medical because she was the only person with a background that was similar to mine.” Despite the lower prevalence of Asian therapists, given student demand, it is necessary to continue to push for representation that reflects the student body and greater cultural competence training in mental health services. Barriers in seeking support “I hope that everyone is able to have a therapist who doesn’t tell the patient, ‘You are ghosting me’ when a patient turns off video or really push the patient to answer questions when they are uncomfortable.” Asian/American students are less likely to seek out mental health treatment than other racial groups.A study published in theJournal of Adolescent Healthsampling over 43,000 university students from 2012 to 2015 also found that Asians have 64% lower odds of medication use and 51% lower odds of therapy compared to all ethnicities. A study by the University of Maryland School of Public Healthfound that common reasons for hesitance to seek treatment include stigma of being perceived as weak or ungrateful (particularly for those of refugee or asylum-seeking backgrounds , lack of awareness of resources, fear of worrying parents, lack of culturally competent professionals, and cost. The study observed that it is taboo to discuss mental health in many Asian cultures and can be perceived as disrespecting spiritual beliefs, leading people to “hide, neglect, or deny symptoms rather than seek help.” When surveying the Asian/American community at MIT, we asked respondents what prevents them from seeking support on-campus: Time and effort:Many respondents mentioned a lack of time and/or energy to reach out or that it is not a priority. Inaccessibility of setting up an appointment: Currently, the only way to schedule an initial appointment is through a phone call, which can be inconvenient and is a barrier to those with social anxiety. Long wait times:Many reported either experiencing firsthand or hearing from others about the long wait times to get an appointment, sometimes exceeding a month. Distrust of professionals:Multiple students felt rushed to start medication, leading to general distrust of professional support. Others reported doubt surrounding the effectiveness of treatment, some stemming from negative past experiences with therapists. Cost and confidentiality:Many reported being unsure about whether insurance covers the bill or not. Multiple also reported cost as an issue, likely stemming from misinformation surrounding insurance policies. Additionally, confidentiality is a significant concern, including mandatory reporting law and visibility of insurance bills. Stigma and lack of perceived need:Multiple students reported feeling weak or experiencing difficulty acknowledging that they need help. Difficulty with teletherapy:Common challenges of teletherapy include difficulty in finding a private space to take sessions, which is especially an issue for students with roommates. “I’ve heard wait times can be really long. But also the stigma that seeking help for mental health means that you’re weak.” “I felt that stereotypes were being projected onto me due to being East Asian. When I hesitated to go on medication for a multitude of reasons, one being my parents’ valid distrust of Western medicine, my psychiatrist would only focus on whether or not I had talked to my parents, rather than ask if other factors were bothering me.” When it comes to seeking mental health, the process should be as accessible and low-effort as possible. Students facing mental health challenges already struggle to set up appointments; this struggle is further compounded for Asian/American students due to stigma surrounding mental health and distrust of professionals. Bettering mental health support on campus “I hope that MIT administration and those with power will listen to our desperate call to improve mental health resources for students. This means putting in the money.” This survey is far from the first time that MIT students have called for improved mental health resources. To probe the most pertinent and pressing needs, we asked respondents about how MIT can better support their mental health. In this section, 38% of respondents demanded that more money be invested in mental health resources, with specific calls to expand availability, reduce wait times, and increase therapist salaries to promote retention. Additionally, many students requested that MIT hire more Asian (or other non-white counselors in order to provide better care for marginalized groups. “Please get more therapists, preferably more non-white therapists too.” Numerous respondents pressed for an easier way to set up appointments, such as an online portal or text-based scheduling system. Citing personal and second-hand experiences, several students described waiting up to a month to secure an appointment, only to receive a phone call from MIT Mental Health while in class or another inconvenient setting where they may not be comfortable setting up a mental health appointment. Moreover, even after the first appointment is scheduled, therapists sometimes do not even show up. A phone-free scheduling system would mitigate the exasperation faced by many students trying to schedule a first appointment, lowering a major barrier to seeking support. Students called for better advertising of available mental health resources and information regarding common concerns (such as confidentiality, cost, expectation of low appointment frequency , more effective guidance towards internal and external therapy options, and the creation of more resources for neurodivergent students. These as well as the aforementioned changes (increasing the availability of appointments and therapists of color, and creating a streamlined, phone-free scheduling system are all necessary steps towards better supporting the mental health of not only Asian/American students, but every member of the MIT community. “We are constantly referred to MIT Mental Health as a beacon of hope for our problems by administrators and faculty whenever we are struggling. This was the case after the massage parlor shootings in 2021. But many of us face immense barriers to even getting an appointment and the consistent, basic care that we need.” Call to action By probing the most pressing problems and pertinent solutions, we aim to amplify the collective voice of Asian/American students as we call out to MIT to improve mental health support for all. To summarize, a majority of respondents expressed the following sentiments: a more therapists (preferably Asian and POC should be hired, as ethnic representation and cultural competency are important for their therapy experience; b inconvenience and unresponsiveness are experienced when placing appointments by phone, and lack of follow-up or attendance of therapists are large concerns — instead, an online scheduling portal is desired; and c respondents feel distrust, exasperation, and impatience when dealing with MIT’s mental health support services. We acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of MIT’s mental health resources to improve support for its students thus far, including currently recruiting and interviewing clinicians, keeping in mind diverse backgrounds and cultural competency. MIT Medical has previously hired a director of diversity, equity and inclusion and appointed clinicians with experience in multicultural outreach in accordance with theMIT Black Students’ Union and Black Graduate Student Association’s 2015 recommendations. These BSU/BGSA recommendations also spurred the genesis of anti-oppression training in MIT counseling services and a graduate Black women’s support group, laying the groundwork for a more equitable campus. However, as clearly demonstrated through the results of this survey, there is more work to be done. Our community is suffering, and we need changenow. “More therapists need to be hired, specifically POC and women/non-binary folks so that people with marginalized identities feel comfortable reaching out to these resources in the first place. I hope our call is not ignored, as it has been time and again.” This article was written by Alana Chandler ’22, Jason Li ’24, and Elaine Wu ’22, members of the MIT Asian American Initiative, a student-run organization for Asian American advocacy, allyship, and civic engagement.

thetech_mit_2022_59,"Graduate student-workers come to MIT to conduct research and teach for a better world. We want to understand how things work and are passionate about research. But we also generate billions of dollars for MIT. MIT as an institution has always reaped financial benefits from our work: its funding and worldwide reputation as a top research university follow from the experiments we run and the code we write. However, while MIT’s net assets exploded from$24 billion in 2020to over$36 billion in 2021, graduate student-workers remain as we always have: severely rent-burdened byU.S. federal standards, paying on average55% of our stipends in rentdue topolicies of MIT’s administration. The need for quality and affordable housing for graduate student-workers is a workplace issue because our living conditionsareour working conditions. When a grad worker is stressed about making rent, rationing meals, or spending significant amounts of time dealing with repairs required due toMIT’s decades of deferred maintenance, it hampers our ability to perform and focus on our research and teaching. Below are just two of the countless stories regarding housing issues that graduate student-workers are facing. Lexy’s story: Edgerton Shortly after moving into our Edgerton apartment at the beginning of August, my roommates and I noticed water dripping down from the ceiling in our living room. Housing shut off the central air and placed a window air conditioning unit in the common space, claiming that the water was condensation on the pipes caused by the temperature being set too low. About a week later, we noticed mold on the ceiling in our closet, so they removed the ceiling panel but did not replace it, exposing the pipes above. These pipes also started dripping, forming a large puddle and rendering our closet unusable. In addition, the dripping water in the living room persisted, so we contacted housing again and they covered the pipes with rags and duct tape, informing us that a more permanent solution would require five to ten days of work, cutting open the ceiling and replacing the hatch. Given that the repairs would substantially disrupt our living space, we opted to hold off on the repairs until IAP. When we later faced problems with our toilets overflowing and flooding the bathroom, failing to flush properly, and making strange noises, housing was slow to arrive, and their fixes were not real solutions. Although each of these issues were eventually addressed, the added stress of dealing with these problems has detracted from my coursework and research and impacted my mental health. Having a clean and functioning living space is very important to me. Others have similarly endured uninhabitable living conditions, includingmold and broken plumbing in Ashdown. All people deserve dignified and safe living conditions. And given what we pay for rent and how wealthy MIT is, we deserve better. Belinda’s story: Site 4 For many Site 4 residents, the price of rent is overwhelming. The efficiency apartment, the cheapest option at Site 4, is priced at$2,274 per month. This is egregious considering that thebaseline monthly stipend ratesestablished by MIT are $3,186 for pre-candidacy research assistants and $3,488 for post-candidacy doctoral research assistants. Thus, even the cheapest Site 4 option can be as high as71%of some workers’ monthly stipend. It’s absurd that MIT deems these rates to be affordable. As a Site 4 resident myself, most months I make barely enough to break even. I’m constantly looking for places to save, and often forgo meals if I’m “not hungry enough” to warrant the extra cost. I find myself stressing about my budget when I should be allocating that time and energy towards research. I had resigned to my fate that my entire time at MIT would be spent like this. After all, I was simply a solitary individual and couldn’t possibly tell MIT to change its housing policies or prices. But then I learned how housing and rent were central issues for grad workers building our union and how many people were facing the same issues as me. With the help of other grad workers in our union, I organized a dorm visit at Site 4. There, I got a chance to hear stories from my neighbors: many of us put Site 4 low in priority during the lottery but were placed here despite ample vacancies in other buildings. Several unlucky individuals have gotten stuck in elevators, some have dealt with peeling paint and murky water, and others still with broken heating. Complaints were filed but not addressed promptly. The front desk was short-staffed. And almost everyone agreed that the rent was too high. These issues are not isolated incidents, but rather widely felt across all graduate residences. We have tried advocating for more affordable housingfor decades through the Graduate Student Counciland student governments within each residence, but to no avail. This is because MIT’s administratorsprioritize profits over peopleand research. Unionizing will address the underlying causes of these problems The root causes of all of these issues are that MIT’s administration maintains unilateral control over our working and living conditions and that we must each deal with our issues alone. Unionizing directly addresses both of these issues. With a legally recognized union, MIT must negotiate with us. And although housing is not a so-called mandatory subject of bargaining, MIT admin is 100% able to negotiate with our union on these issues. When they say otherwise, it’s because MIT’s administrators would prefer to leave us severely rent-burdened and without quality housing rather than respectfully negotiate with our union. MIT — with its immense wealth derived from our work — can surely subsidize housing (asStanford doesby 30% and improve the safety and quality of the living spaces we occupy. Unionizing will usher in a qualitative change in that none of us will ever be alone as we try to navigate mold, brown water, and broken heaters. We will have access to a powerful grievance procedure to address our specific housing issues. And we’ll have our union of thousands of grad workers standing together to insist on safe, quality, and affordable housing. We don’t have to suffer in silence! Through the power of collective organization, we can do something to change our situation.

stanforddaily_2022_127,"By Jacob Budnitz This past quarter, students and faculty alike noticed that lectures were constantly interrupted by a cacophony of coughing from students. In previous years, such coughing could be written off as the flu or common cold making its seasonal rounds. In the middle of a pandemic, however, Stanford can no longer afford to treat students coughing en masse so casually. Instead, Stanford must actively encourage students feeling sick or exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms to recuse themselves from attending class to prevent them from potentially infecting others. Currently, many courses incentivize sick students to attend class by not providing complete lecture recordings. While lecture notes, PowerPoint slides or audio recordings do mitigate the effects of missing class for an illness, they don’t provide the full benefit that a complete lecture recording (a recording that includes both video and audio of the lecture provides. Lecture notes rarely capture the nuanced components of a lecture, PowerPoints often omit the connections between the material on individual slides for the sake of brevity and audio recordings are difficult to follow because of ambiguous references to “this” and “that” which only make sense with a visual aid. Thus, if a course does not provide a complete lecture recording, sick students are forced to choose between the health of their classmates and doing well in their courses. However, this choice is one that students should not have to make. And it’s also one that the University could easily eliminate by requiring that complete recordings be provided for all lectures, at least for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hopefully, such a requirement would remove any incentives that potentially sick students might have to come to class and consequently reduce the spread of COVID-19 and other illnesses. While this solution may sound easy to achieve, there are significant yet definitely surmountable obstacles to its implementation. The most challenging obstacle to providing students with full video and audio recordings is likely the issue of consent. For lecture recordings to be made available, all participants must consent to be recorded. During the 2020-2021 academic year, consent was easily obtained as Zoom prompted everyone participating in the live lecture to acknowledge that the recording was “in progress” before participating. Now, with in-person instruction tentatively set to resume week three of the winter term, obtaining consent may be less convenient, but it’s not impossible. For example, the University could require all lecture participants to consent to be recorded for the winter quarter prior to the start of in-person instruction. In addition to obtaining participants’ consent, the University would have to provide the equipment and labor needed to record lectures and make them available to students. To overcome this obstacle, Stanford only needs to purchase video and audio recording equipment and train TAs how to use it — a feat that MIT has demonstrated to be achievable through MIT OpenCourseWare (even with an endowment around $10 billion less than Stanford’s . Some professors have also expressed concerns that if lecture recordings are made available on demand, in-person lecture attendance could decrease and students may not retain material as well by watching online recordings (compared to attending lectures in person . Even if lecture recordings decrease in-person lecture attendance, the claim that student learning would automatically suffer as a result is not necessarily true.Educational researchfocusing on students at Harvard Medical School has found that students find “video-recorded lectures equally or more valuable” than attending lectures in-person. This student preference for recorded lectures instead of live ones can likely be attributed to the fact that a majority of students report that watching recorded lectures makes them more likely to “increase their speed of knowledge acquisition” (>79% of students , “look up additional information” (>67% and “stay focused” (>64% . To many Stanford students, these findings are not surprising as most have experienced lectures that go too slow to keep our attention, too fast to allow us to look up references necessary for understanding material or are just simply difficult to focus on for long periods of time. However, even if providing complete lecture recordings does negatively impact student learning, Stanford must allow its students to make the decision to incur that negative outcome — the University can’t hold its students’ hands forever. From limiting student gatherings to indoor mask mandates, Stanford has already implemented restrictions aimed at curtailing a person’s potential to spread COVID-19, regardless of whether the person is actually at risk of doing so. If Stanford is truly committed to stopping COVID-19, then it must encourage students with signs or symptoms of infectious illness to stay away from large indoor gatherings like classroom lectures, as this is a fundamental, universally recommended measure to protect our community. Providing full video and audio recordings for all lectures, at least for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, should be immediately implemented as it is a reasonable, rational requirement to help protect our fellow students, faculty and staff.

wildcat_arizona_2022_54,"Thousands of books line the shelves at “Book Stop” on Sunday, Feb. 21 in Tucson, Ariz. The company, currently located on 4th Avenue, has been around for over fifty years. Frequenting local bookstores can be a great way to find a new book to read. Over the past two years, reading has become a part of my daily routine. In 2021, I made a New Year’s resolution to read one book a month and ended up reading 35 books. This year, I had a goal to read 50 books but read 50 by the middle of April, so now my goal is 150. Reading has become one of my favorite hobbies. I grew up reading and loved doing it until middle school when reading became mandatory for my English classes. I did not like being forced to read books I had no interest in, so I stopped reading entirely. I tried to read the books assigned to me but never finished any of them. This continued through high school, but I made it my mission to read a book monthly during the latter half of my senior year and found that getting to choose the books I read is what made reading enjoyable. High schoolers often do not want to read the assigned reading for English class, and this carries over to college. Most college classes require more reading done outside of class time, but the mandatory readings in high school make it hard for students to get back into reading for classes. There have beenstudiesthat have shown the majority of college students do not read in-depth for assignments, and adults in the United States are spending less time reading. Reading benefits people of all ages. Somebenefitsinclude reducing stress, increasing brain activity and expanding vocabulary. However, with technology growing rapidly in popularity, reading has moved to the back burner for so many people. During the past two years, book TikTok, also known as “BookTok,” has increased in popularity and so have book sales. Because of how expansive TikTok is, BookTok has reached millions of people, and many authorslikeColleen Hoover and Taylor Jenkins Reid have seen an increase in popularity. Many BookTok creators are young readers, which helps them connect with their peers and helps more young people become interested in reading. BookTok has even influenced the book-selling giant Barnes & Noble. Barnes & Noble and TikTok have apartnership: a summer reading challenge that motivates people to post about books they read. Many Barnes & Noble stores also have BookTok tables that contain the most talked about books on the site. BookTok has helped bring reading back to a younger generation and has increased book sales worldwide. RELATED:Stories to give you a break from your textbooks Reading has made me a better person. It has helped me focus for an extended period of time, and it has helped me connect with others who read the same books. I also do not spend as much time on my electronics. Not spending as much time on electronics has helped me reconnect with my family and friends and has decreased my stress/anxiety. Reading can be done virtually anywhere, and there are many ways to get discounted or even free books. There are manylibrariesin Pima County where people can borrow books, and places likeBookman’soffer gently used books at discounted prices. If people do not want physical books, Amazon Kindle is a great alternative andKindle Unlimitedis cheaper than buying books monthly. Reading is a hobby that everyone can enjoy. It is easy to get into, helps reduce stress and has many benefits. You can enjoy it alone or read with family and friends, and reading can help you lose yourself in an imaginary world.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_32,"The Year of the Tiger began on Feb. 1, the start of 2022’s Lunar New Year. Among many Asian communities, this festival holds significance as the denoter of new beginnings and prosperity – being able to celebrate it to the fullest, surrounded by friends and family, while completing all the old traditions, is a distinctive part of the importance of the occasion. In UC Irvine’s own student community, the popularity and crowd at ASUCI’s Lunar Night Market indicated how enthusiastic the student body was to have an opportunity to be able to celebrate culture. As the popularity of the occasion increases in western communities, Lunar New Year becomes a festival that begs the question: should it be made a federal holiday? The short answer is: absolutely. Doing so would benefit the people that need time to spend with their families on the momentous festival, to mark the beginning of a new year. It would also help create a larger inclusivity in the American calendar of holidays – especially in the past years’ cultural climate that has given way to the Stop Asian Hate movement. New York Rep. Grace Mengintroduceda bill on Feb. 2 to make the festival a holiday, in order to “recognize the cultural and historical significance of Lunar New Year.” Through this, she emphasizes that the broader American communities also understand the belief that giving Lunar New Year recognition in the federal sense would not only validate the cultural conflicts faced by the country’s growing Asian-American population, but would also ensure that students around the country learn about the necessity of respecting diversity. Simple recognition may truly end up being the key to harmony. When traditions can be understood on a wider scale, societies can become more accepting of diversity. Since some school districts in New York, Virginia and Iowa alreadyclosefor Lunar New Year, establishing Lunar New Year as a federal holiday would give the festival more validity. Several Asian-American communities tend to feeldisplacedin the country even if they have lived here for generations. This cultural confusion can be attributed to the lack of mainstream awareness and acceptance of different cultures. Taking the first steps toward recognizing the cultural diversity that the United States hosts would be the first step toward creating a community that is not plagued by cultural divide. Making Lunar New Year a federal holiday would allow for the festival to be celebrated in its entirety, and would also help other communities pitch in for increased awareness of different cultural traditions. For the Washington Post, UCI’s Professor of Asian American Studies Judy Wustatedthat, “Lunar New Year celebrations, while rooted in tradition and culture, have also been important for Asian Americans for economic and political reasons.” This sentiment is clearly echoed by lawmakers. Ensuring that Asian American communities have the opportunity to celebrate a festival that is integral to their roots would help create a sense of compassion within communities that would ensure that Asian Americans aren’t forced to be conflicted between their Asian and American identities, as perceived by those around them. The acceptance of this proposal would guarantee that future generations, regardless of racial descent, will respect and value the different perspectives surrounding celebrations that exist. Since several people mark the occasion with an ode to their ancestors, this bill would also do the same. Asian communities wereridiculedfor simply existing and following their traditions and cultures in the 19th and 20th centuries (with a rise in those similar emotions today . We need to honor the traditions that have borne hurt over a long period of time, especially with therecentrise of incessant intolerance, by giving cultures the respect and recognition they deserve.

crimson_2022_85,"In the spring of 2019, I got coffee with my uncle’s brother Brent A. Renaud, a Nieman Fellow at the time. I was a pre-frosh, nervous about matriculating; Brent was kind enough to offer me his time and insights about Harvard. He seemed to truly enjoy his time here and the work he was doing, from taking classes to mentoring students to working on his own projects. It meant a lot to me to have family already at the institute where I was to spend my next four years. It was the first time I felt as though Harvard wasn’t so distant. I’d grown up in awe of Brent and my Uncle Craig’s work as journalists and documentary filmmakers who willingly entered dangerous conflict zones to lift up those without a voice and expose the realities of war, oppression, and injustice to all. I watched my aunt worry over their trips to Mexico to cover drug cartels, or to Iraq when the Arkansas National Guardsmen were deployed there. As I grew in age and in understanding of their mission, I fostered a deep respect and admiration for their bravery and incredible commitment to telling such important stories. Last week, Brent was tragically shot and killed near Kyiv, Ukraine, while covering the refugee crisis there. He was with Juan Arredondo, also a former Nieman Fellow, who is still recovering from his injuries in Kyiv. I had known that he was in Ukraine. Though I was concerned, I had assumed he would be safe while documenting the refugee crisis — hopefully distanced from the center of fire. But as we found out more, we learned that journalists in the area were being targeted and attacked by Putin’s government. As Brent’s family, we all knew the risks of his line of work. We believed in its necessity just as he did. In making visible the unfortunately oft-overlooked suffering at the heart of crises, Brent threatened the control of those in power — and paid the ultimate sacrifice for it. This was his life’s work. He made an outsize difference in the world up until the very end. My thoughts are with the people of Ukraine and their friends and family elsewhere who are affected by this baseless conflict. Additionally, I look to the journalists who are carrying on the work that Brent was doing, and especially to my Uncle Craig, who was Brent’s other half in his life’s work. I grieve for Uncle Brent and all the others hurt in this crisis, and I am angered by the unnecessary loss and suffering. Most of all, I am heartbroken over the time I thought I had left to connect with Brent, to learn from him, to see the heart that he put into these projects — a time unfairly cut short. While he was a Nieman Fellow, Brent, along with Juan, put in many hours at The Crimson mentoring our student journalists. In the spring of 2019, when I expressed interest in joining The Crimson, he recommended the organization wholeheartedly to me. Last week, a former Crimson editor who had worked with Brent told me that, before his fellowship ended, Brent had expressed his excitement at the prospect of my joining the Crimson. My work here and elsewhere will always be inspired by his passion. Rest in peace, Uncle Brent. Sara Komatsu ’23-’24, a Crimson Arts Editor-at-Large, is an English concentrator in Dunster House."

To the editor, Today I learned that one of my incoming international frosh students for the class of 2026 has not yet received her F1 visa and will not be able to arrive on campus for the start of Autumn quarter. After inquiring about being allowed to arrive Winter quarter, permission for late arrival was denied. She was told by Stanford administration that there is no flexibility about starting time. She will therefore have to wait a full year before starting at Stanford. The administration alleges that our data, as well as that from all of Stanford’s peer institutions, shows that allowing international students to start one quarter late due to visa delays puts them at an academic and personal disadvantage for the rest of their undergraduate experience. Perhaps the data are accurate, but the administration might try to solve this problem, not only for this student but for others in the same situation. In this case, the student had to pay for a trip from her country (which has no U.S. consular services to issue a visa to Singapore in order to apply for the visa, and now will have to repeat the same procedure next year to join Stanford in Fall 2023. A physics Olympiad champion, she is losing an important year where she might have been sharing her excellence with our Stanford community. Stanford has the resources to better prepare our international students to arrive in time for the Autumn quarter of their acceptance. In fact, we are exceptionally proactive about getting other groups of students here on time and even early. For example, some of our football players accepted by Dec 15 arrive in the classrooms by Winter quarter to help them adjust academically. Imagine what could be done for our international students if we simply had the visa process rolling earlier. Imagine if Stanford were as proactive with other groups, such as first-generation, low-income students, to ensure their success and the vibrant diversity of every incoming class. We must do better for our students. Sincerely, Dr. Ruth A. Starkman Program in Writing and Rhetoric The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.

ubyssey_2022_25,"May 24, 2022 Written byIman Janmohamed Hi Iman, I’m back home this summer, but home doesn’t feel like home. Any advice on how to deal with feeling out of control? I completely get where you’re coming from. But, here’s the thing: your hometown is changing and so are you. I love living away from home, but it’s an awful feeling to come back and realize that the streets you used to walk, the school you used to go to and the friends you used to see all the time are a bit different. And that, dear reader, is completely okay. Growing up is difficult and it hurts to see things change somewhere you grew up, but that doesn’t mean it’s all bad. You’ve met great friends, you’ve joined cool clubs and you’ve enriched your mind with a university education. You’ve grown! You’ve grown up! Instead of trying to make your hometown feel homey, take it for what it is: a complex place that changes just like you do. You can’t always be in control of what happens to your surroundings, but you can make the best of it. Getting back into the things you loved to do when you lived at home — like going to your favourite coffee shop and hanging out with those friends you only see four months a year — might make you feel closer to home and who you were when you lived there. Homewashome and itishome. It’s just different now since you’ve been away. I used to feel guilty for feeling like Vancouver was becoming my home. But it’s natural to put down roots in the place where you spend the better part of a year. Just because home doesn’t feel the same as it used to doesn’t mean that it’s no longer home. Learning that it’s okay to have two or three or four homes that can hold different versions of you as you grow is important. No one said that you can only have one home. You’re constantly growing and changing and so is the world around you. You re doing great. Keep it up! Want to ask a stranger for advice? Well, you’re in luck!

stanforddaily_2022_16,"I am by no means a staunch ally of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. He isbankrolled by PG&E, the state’s largest utility company that he lets get off scot-free despite itsclear responsibility for wildfires under his watch. He has also abandoned his 2018 campaignpledge to enact a single-payer healthcare programin the state. This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to my critiques for the leader of the Golden State. We should not ignore Newsom’s broken promises, but it is necessary to take note when he clearly demonstrates political ingenuity. For the midterm elections this year, he went on the offensive forProposition 1. If a majority of California voters support it, there will be constitutional protections in the state for contraceptives and abortion. Newsom made the right decision to go on a$2.5 million ad campaign on the ballot measure’s behalf. This is the right course of action even when considering the fact that abortion faces little risk in California; Newsom has already signeda series of bills into law expanding abortion protectionsin California. Taking a stand against the Supreme Court’s disgustingrepeal ofRoe v. Wadelast June, Newsom’s approach will serve Democratic politics well. Amid concerns that Democratic prospects will take a turn for the worse and hand Congress as well as state governments across the country over to Republicans, Newsom will not leave it up to chance. On the fight for Prop 1 to keep abortion in the political conversation, Newsom said to Politico, “The better we do on this, the more intensity, the more we dial it up, I also think it sends a message that reverberates across our borders.” The connection between victories for Democrats across the nation and the fight for abortion access could not be more obvious. Even in Kansas where voters last voted blue on the presidential level in1964,59 percent of voterswanted to keep abortion protections in place. The power that abortion has to tip the scales in favor of Democrats panned out once more ina tightly won House election in New York, where Democrat Pat Ryan outperformed Biden’s margins in the area two years ago. Hours afterRoe v. Wadewas overturned, hereleased his campaign’s first adand had abortion as the core message. A former Army officer during the Iraq War, Ryan rhetorically asked “How can we be a free country if the government tries to control women’s’ bodies?” and responded “That’s not the country I fought to defend.” Ryan made his support for abortion central to his campaign. This is a good sign, considering howmost predictions and trends throughout historypoint to a Democratic loss of the House during midterm elections with a sitting Democratic President. At the very least, Newsom is pointing in the general direction that Democrats can and should follow. The importance of Newsom’s direction is underscored by the strong role that California has long had on the national stage. The state was at theforefront of several fights against the Trump administrationon issues such as climate change, immigration, education and healthcare. Kamala Harris, prior to becoming vice president andbreaking Senate tieson important pieces of legislation, was the attorney general for California and then served as one of its U.S. senators. Looking even further back in history, beforeChief Justice Earl Warrenbrought the Supreme Court to an era of ensuring civil liberties and racial justice, he served as attorney general and governor in California. The state, for several decades now, has been leaving its mark on the country. While voters outside California will have no say on its abortion measure, that does not mean they are not feeling the effects of the conversation that California is helping shape. Since the Supreme Court toreRoe v. Wadeto shreds, women have made upa majority of newly registered votersin the states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Importantly, this comes asa recent Gallup poll analysishas shown women to vote for Democratic candidates 14 percentage points more often than Republican candidates, a strong sign for Democratic turnout. Crucially, those three states are poised to have close racesfor their respective Senate races. In a just barely Democratic-controlled Senate, this is of paramount importance. Increasingly competitive senatorial and gubernatorial races in the Midwest get a lot of focus, reasonably so. The Newsom approach of embracing the abortion fight full-stop will serve Democrats well in those races. Maintaining this message gives newly-registered and continuing Democratic voters something clear and urgent to rally around. The nation is looking to California once again, and Newsom on the fight for Prop 1 and reproductive justice in general is in the spotlight. Newsom continues to be on the right side of this fight, and I commend him wholeheartedly for his bold action. He is helping to pull the Democratic Party in the right direction. I hope that this is one of the things that gets Democrats across the finish line to winning congressional seats, state legislatures, governorships and local offices across the country.

rice_thresher_2022_39,"ByThresher Editorial Board4/5/22 11:11pm After three years and much anticipation, we finally had a normal Beer Bike. None of the past week’s events could have been possible without the hard work of every Beer Bike coordinator, bike captain, chug captain and every student, staff and alumni who played a role in making Beer Bike 2022 the spectacular event it was. To the senior Beer Bike coords — we appreciate you not only bringing back what Beer Bike used to be, but improving upon that and passing on your vision to the next generation of Owls. We know that you wanted Beer Bike traditions back in full more than anyone, and we are grateful for your diligent work to make that happen for all of us. For the coords who experienced Beer Bike for the first time, thank you for putting in the work to revive this Rice tradition. We understand the immense pressure placed on people trying to plan an event that is such a core part of Rice culture without having seen it firsthand. To the rest of the student body, last Saturday and its aftermath reminded all of us why we love the Rice community so much. We appreciate everyone looking out for each other’s safety on race day, and the outpouring of support for Lauren Hurt, who was injured during the race, has been nothing short of remarkable. This is not to say that there were no issues. There were track closures early in the week that prevented teams from practicing and night bikes from happening. There were reports of altercations at the Martel public and some obvious visibility issues on race day. We hope that next year’s Beer Bike will address some of the issues that arose this year, but in the meantime, we appreciate everything that went into making Beer Bike 2022. Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Savannah Kuchar, Ben Baker-Katz, Nayeli Shad, Talha Arif, Morgan Gage, Daniel Schrager and Brandon Chen.

thetech_mit_2022_18,"As a graduate worker in Chemical Engineering, I work on the exciting process of designing and synthesizing new zeolite catalysts to improve sustainable plastic processing. Coming from an undergraduate lab that worked with zeolites, I thought I knew what to expect when I first started out. However, over the years at MIT working with countless chemical and physical hazards in my lab, I have come to learn first hand how MIT systematically neglects graduate worker health and safety. This all came to a head when I found myself in an ambulance after a chemical exposure, unsure if I would live or die. When I began my PhD project on zeolite synthesis, I knew that I would have to use hydrofluoric acid (HF , since it’s the only chemical able to clean zeolite residue — basically glass — out of our synthesis reactor liners. HF is notoriously dangerous. It goes straight through skin and is volatile enough to be inhaled. HF seeks out and attacks calcium sources in the body and can dissolve bones, cause necrosis, and stop the heart. To make matters worse, symptoms from an HF exposure can take hours to appear, at which point it may be too late for treatment. On day one of my research, I was shocked to learn that MIT refuses to provide our lab with basic protections for working with HF, despite years of graduate workers, our PI, and our excellent environmental health and safety (EHS coordinator doing everything they could to request adequate provisions. Rather than having access to a dedicated HF hood, which is standard practice — including in my undergraduate lab, — workers in my lab are forced to use all acids in a single hood, which leads to dangerous overcrowding, risk of spills, and unnecessary HF exposure. This single hood is also located in a high-traffic lab, meaning that everyone working in the space is at risk when anyone works with HF. Our hood space is so cramped and facilities so lacking that we don’t even have room to keep the hazardous waste solution from HF in a vented space. These dangerous conditions ultimately led to the incident that could have left me dead. One of the weekly procedures in my work involves cleaning the zeolite synthesis liners in a big bath of HF solution inside the aforementioned cramped fume hood. Then, we typically neutralize the HF acid in a base bath inside the fume hood. Periodically, we have to empty the base bath to replenish the potassium hydroxide base that gets depleted over time as it reacts with the HF. On the day of the incident, following protocol and believing it was just dilute potassium hydroxide, I removed the base bath from the hood while dressed in standard lab PPE — without the extra layers of HF protective gear. While dumping the bath into the waste carboy, however, I noticed clouds of vapor forming. Because it was my first time emptying the bath, I thought this could be a normal occurrence. However, when I tested the pH, I found it was acidic, implying that the “base bath” had in fact become a big tub of HF solution! I was dealing with a potentially deadly exposure to HF outside of the fume hood. I immediately evacuated the lab and called MIT EHS for assistance. EHS helped me confirm that the HF was properly contained but didn’t ask or advise about my safety. Only after I asked did EHS instruct me to call MIT Medical to see if I should go in for urgent care for HF exposure. I was surprised. My past training and other members of my lab told me to go directly to urgent care or even call an ambulance. Nonetheless, I followed the EHS instructions. At MIT Medical, it was clear they were not at all equipped to treat me and didn’t know what to do. They finally decided to call an ambulance nearly three hours after my initial exposure. At the hospital, I was immediately seen by a doctor for monitoring and several tests. Chillingly, I was informed that any symptoms of HF exposure would have shown within 2 hours, well before I was sent to the ER. In other words, had symptoms started, MIT’s unprepared and delayed response could have left me dead. I am alive todayonlybecause I was extremely lucky that the concentration of HF wasn’t higher. Just a few days later, I started getting calls from the hospital and ambulance about paying for the bill. I had to call MIT Occupational Health and Safety and was ultimately promised that the costs would be covered under workers’ compensation. Yet, the collectors kept sending bills for months demanding payment. When I reached out again to MIT, I was bounced around between multiple people before being referred to an external adjuster. As I write this over four months after the exposure, I have received no confirmation or closure from MIT and can only assume it’s been taken care of. At each point in this terrifying, frustrating, and near-death experience with HF, I was let down by MIT’s dangerously deficient safety provisions. I want to be very clear: My PI and our EHS coordinator have done everything they can. Our EHS coordinator goes above and beyond to keep us as safe as possible given the constraints of what limited resources MIT provides to EHS. The problem is not with EHS, but rather with MIT systematically refusing to adequately fund and support EHS in carrying out its safety work. As it stands, EHS doesn’t have the power or resources to install a fume hood. Indeed, my incident is not isolated but reflects a systematic failure by MIT to provide even basic workplace safety measures — despite the fact that grad workers work with cancer-causing and reproductive toxins, lethal and flammable chemicals, and biological hazards every single day. In the past four months within the Chemical Engineering department alone, I am one of four graduate workers who has been hospitalized from chemical exposure. MIT has not yet hired a permanent EHS coordinator for the Chemistry department after the previous one left, leaving the safety of 300 graduate workers — as well as undergraduates and postdocs — up to a precarious system of temporary EHS workers doing their best to advise, support, and provide basic safety measures without any degree of stability. Another graduate worker, hospitalized after a potentially life-threatening chemical exposure during their assigned laboratory work, was forced by MIT to use their personal insurance to cover the expenses because they had earned a fellowship and MIT thus classified the injury as personal rather than work-related — leaving the grad worker with eight months of stressful calls with debt collectors. MIT simply chooses not to provide the funding, staff, or equipment to EHS to implement basic safety precautions, and it leaves graduate workers on their own when they’re hurt on the job. MIT is cutting corners on our health and wellbeing! But graduate workers are not disposable! My incident with HF exposure has strengthened my conviction that we urgently need our union contract provisions in order to improve and codify workplace safety. If we had our proposed contract provisions, my lab’s repeated request for additional acid hoods would have been enforceably addressed with the provision that we are guaranteed a safe work environment and facilities. With our contract proposal requiring MIT to develop and train EHS and Medical in chemical emergency response, I would have gotten emergency advice that wouldn’t have risked killing me. With our proposal to empower EHS with appropriate staffing, equipment, and training, we could establish the basis for a truly proactive approach to preventing chemical exposure incidents in the first place. In my case, experts could have evaluated the safety of our lab procedure and implemented changes to better deal with HF waste disposal. And with guaranteed workers’ compensation in a contract and a grievance procedure, I would have had a clear way to follow-up with EHS about getting bills paid. Our union isproposingbasic, common sense demands that will preempt avoidable safety incidents, keep researchers safe, and enable MIT researchers to safely carry out cutting edge research without being forced to put our lives on the line. And yet, the MIT administration is dragging its feet on coming to agreement on these basic proposals. MIT has no excuse to force us to conduct research in such unsafe conditions, and we demand that MIT affirm its commitment to graduate worker safety by agreeing to our health and safety contract proposals. As graduate workers, we are united behind our contract demands to guarantee us equipment, supplies, facilities, and experts that ensure we have a safe workspace and assist our EHS coordinators in doing their jobs.Join us for ourWe are not disposable!town hallabout health and safety on Tuesday, November 15, at 5:30 p.m. in 66-110, andjoin our Contract Action Teamto help win our contract.

crimson_2022_138,"Congratulations, Classes of 2020, 2021, and 2022! When you started your undergraduate journey you imagined your commencement celebration differently. In the early days of the pandemic, no one could have pictured how the world would change — yet you persisted through its exigent demands and earned your degree with much instruction being remote. Now, as you return to campus for an in-person ceremony, the full magnitude of your accomplishment may not be apparent — a formality in honor of an achievement in the distant past. I hope you appreciate the significance of this occasion. You persevered through challenges and trauma no students have faced before — and earned a degree. You are impressive, and you should celebrate! As I reflect on my message to you I wonder: will you remember what I write? I fervently hope so, since my message is to implore you to ask our alma mater to do more to address the climate crisis. (Confession: for my own graduation, I barely remember the speech by a hero of government integrity, and know my relatives were more excited by celebrity sightings of my classmates’ families . Please take in my message, from an alum who got a taste of activism on campus where my own views were challenged, my critical thinking skills developed, and my commitment to social justice solidified. I ended up an elected official in Cambridge, a city I first visited moving into my first-year dorm, a city now the focus of my public service and activism. Harvard has produced many remarkable graduates — thinkers, doers, poets, artists, and every type of world player — and its leadership in college affordability is just one example of forward thinking and positive changes. Other areas are works in progress. Harvard plays an important role in the city — in hundreds of ways college students help our young students and hundreds of ways the University interacts with and improves our city’s operations. As a School Committee member for more than a decade and now as City Councilor, I know how much Harvard contributes. Recently I’ve focused on our collective work on the climate crisis. I am grateful for the University’s leadership in this area; Harvard has committed to fossil fuel neutrality by 2026 and becoming fossil fuel-zero by 2050. Cambridge itself has officially committed to carbon neutrality by 2050 and the Council has pledged to 2035. Although I am thankful for the substantial work that Harvard and the city have done to address the climate crisis, it is not enough. The climate crisis is central to our survival and to all work on equity, since vulnerable populations are already and will continue to be most affected by the calamitous impacts of a chaotic, warmed world. Catastrophic wildfires burning today, heat waves smothering entire cities, houses washed into the sea daily, and an uptick in diseases run rampant in every corner of the globe. As an alum and a City Councilor, I consider it crucial to hold our institutions accountable for actions that will have decades-long consequences. Cambridge declared a climate emergency over a decade ago and has failed to meet almost every goal that’s been set, especially in terms of greenhouse gas pollution reduction. And Harvard, for all its scientific advances and worthy contributions to the world, contributes a notable portion of the city’s overall emissions. Specifically in Cambridge, buildings are responsible for 80 percent of citywide emissions, and Harvard buildings account for a significant amount (MIT down the road accounts for about as much as Harvard — pass it on to your MIT friends . It will be challenging to re-configure building operations to decarbonize. It will cost money and be disruptive, but those are not valid reasons to delay. As is often said, if Harvard with all its resources can’t do it, what hope is there for others? An emissions-free Harvard by 2035 is possible, if we commit the necessary financial and intellectual resources towards that goal. You are in a position to make change. As evidenced by thevictory wonby Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard last year, sustained public pressure from students and community members works. It can be grueling and demanding, but ultimately activism, especially from people in positions of privilege, can be an effective part of advocacy. We, as Harvard graduates, have a rare type of privilege that we must challenge ourselves to wield. Join me in asking and inspiring Harvard to not only work to contain the emissions pollution elsewhere, but also here, in its own home, and end all emissions from every Harvard building before it is too late. And don’t stop there — take this message of urgency and action wherever you go. Also, wherever you land, vote with the climate in mind. Patricia M. Nolan ’80 is a graduate of Harvard College and currently serves as a Cambridge City Councilor."
crimson_2022_46,"I want to say that 2022 has been a year for Black women. The truth is, though, every year is a year for Black women. From January to December, Black women fight in the latest battles of long-standing campaigns — forequal pay,reproductive justice, thecontinued survival of democracy— relentlessly pursuing avenues for change. But this year we alsodominated the Emmys, Meghan Marklereclaimed her narrativefrom the British press, the nationrallied to bring Brittney Griner home, Minnesota watched as Black women wereelected to its state senatefor the first time in its 164 years of statehood, and the nation watched asthe first Black female justicewas confirmed to the highest court in the land. And to top the year off, right here at Harvard, Claudine Gay wasnamed the University’s 30th President— the first person of color and the first Black woman to hold the premier position at the world s premier institution. So today, we celebrate because when Black women win, moments become movements. Seeing a Black woman elevated to one of the highest positions in our institution — uplifting and affirming both her Blackness and her womanhood in a way that combats Harvard s historical mistreatment and rejection of both identities — is certainly cause for celebration. Black Harvard rejoices. Black Harvard women — especially those who share in her Caribbean descent — sit filled with pride, our emotions running high. Over the last dozen hours, I have watched as we each rush to repost the snippets of her joyous giggles at her raucous reception, proudly showing the world that the next face of Harvard, for the first time ever, looks like us. We raise our flags and spread word to family group chats that not only the fairest of them all but also the highest-ranked is Black. We celebrate Dean (and, now, President-elect Gay the way we celebrated Princess Tiana, Duchess Meghan, Vice President Kamala, and Justice Ketanji. And we champion this moment as a shining pillar of possibility for the realization of liberatory pursuits for people of underrepresented identities on Harvard’s campus and beyond. Because when Black women win, we memorialize them. Claudine Gay is an exceptional woman. She is a scholar who believes in imaginative, interdisciplinary pedagogy, and a much-admired administrator whose mission has been to foster a creative, intellectually vibrant, and socially responsible Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Colleagues say that Gay’s commitment to inspire and inquire while amplifying diverse voices and views makes her the perfect fit for the celebrated gig. As our community enters this new chapter, it does not yet know just how lucky — and wildly undeserving — it is to have this friend, wife, mother, and trailblazing daughter of Caribbean immigrants at the helm. As FAS Dean, Claudine Gay has steered the University through tempestuous times. When our campus and the world beyond it was turbulent, her hand was steady. Over the course of that time, the decisions that came across her desk demanded the same tricky navigational skills needed to maneuver the multilayered texture of the Black woman’s life — the grace and pure competence required to constantly find the best way to achieve a common good against all odds and at times against powerful opposition. In contentious conversations, of which there were surely many, she was expected to move seamlessly, each time with unwavering poise. No longer simply herself, Dean Gay — friend, wife, mother, daughter, educator — became, like so many Black women, an allegory for responsibility, called to be visible and loud or behind-the-scenes and quiet as the moment demanded. But when Black women win, their great power comes with great responsibility. Like superheroes, Black women are supposed to be reliable and resilient. When buildings are burning and people need to save the day – or, too often, save face – we are often called on to put the fire out. But to be the first responder is no easy feat, and we run into each crisis with the weight of the world on our shoulders. We must fit through closed doors while breaking them down, sift through the soot while making way for the next generation of firefighters, all while ensuring that nobody gets burned or sick from the smoke. Claudine Gay will become the first University President tasked with carrying the heavy legacies of both Harvard and Black women simultaneously at an institution where, at one time, neither were permitted. And, whether we are criticizing her missteps or praising her accomplishments, we must remember that to be the first Black woman selected for such a high role tends to raise the stakes — that the vitriol she will be subjected to, even if well-warranted, will often echo with the sordid truth that the institution she will lead wasn’t built with women like her in mind. There will undoubtedly be days that we are prouder to have Claudine Gay represent us as University President than others. Every day, we must remember that while our feelings are valid, they must also be nuanced, compassionate, and sensitive. I’m sure that the Harvard community will continue to rally, organize, and demand that our institution finally realizes the promises of its mission, as they should. And this inherently requires holding even our first Black female University President to the highest standards of anti-racism, anti-imperialism, and anti-inequity standards. But we should never forget that progress depends on love, something the world often doesn’t give Black women enough of. To love Black women means to listen to, protect, and see us, to make it a point to fight for us as we fight for everybody else, and to trust us. Without question, I can say that the people I trust the most in this world are Black women. And so, in return for Gay’s vow to pour into us, we must also vow to pour into her. We should want more for her, the way we want more for us. We should want her to enter rooms where she is valued, to feel fulfilled by her work, to be able to celebrate her wins without the trauma that too often comes with winning as a Black woman at Harvard and in America. So, congratulations Claudine Gay. I hope you stand firm in your dreams for the University, that you will show us all your version, self-defined and self-determined, of what it means for Black women to win, especially here at Harvard. I’ll be rooting and praying for you all the way through. Because when Black women win, we’re all better for it. Kyla N. Golding ’24, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a History of Science and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality concentrator in Adams House."
rice_thresher_2022_42,"ByVinay Tummarakota3/22/22 11:07pm Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. On Feb. 2, 2022, the Thresher published anopinionadvocating for Seth Huston to undergo allyship training in response to his comments on trans-women’s participation in women’s sports. While I whole-heartedly endorse several of the authors’ key claims — such as their opposition toHouse Bill 25— their interpretation of evidence regarding the effects of hormone therapy on trans-athletes lacks appropriate context, serving as a reminder to critically evaluate evidence in politically fraught discourse. For example, the article cites asystematic reviewpublished in the British Journal of Sports Medicine to claim that “measures of strength and muscle area in trans-women also fall to less than that of cis men” following hormone therapy. However, this claim omits critical context, neglecting to mention that the review also concludes that “values for muscular strength, LBM lean body mass and muscle area in transwomen remain above those of cisgender women, even after 36 months of hormone therapy.” The article then goes on to cite ametastudyof eight research articles which finds “no direct or consistent research suggesting transgender female individuals (or male individuals have an athletic advantage.” However, this metastudy includes just one quantitative cross-sectionalstudythat evaluates the effects of hormone therapy on physiological characteristics. This singular study — which compares the muscle-mass of post-treatment trans-women to pre-treatment trans-men — found a statistically significant difference in muscle mass between the two groups. Given these issues with the authors’ interpretation of the literature, one might be tempted to conclude that trans-women must be barred from competing alongside cis-women in athletics. However, there are several arguments in favor of trans-inclusionary policies that must be considered before reaching such a conclusion. First, the systematic review notes several limitations of existing research including but not limited to the dearth of prospective studies, small sample sizes, high rates of attrition and study populations composed of untrained individuals as opposed to trained athletes. An additional limitation raised by the cross-sectional study is the lack of height-matched control groups. Given thatheightis associated with lean body mass and variation in height is viewed as an acceptable natural difference in most sports, studies comparing trans- and cis- athletes ought to stratify comparisons of lean body mass by height. Independent of these limitations, however, is the broader philosophical issue of the level of natural variation that is acceptable within a given category of sport. To examine the issue, consider the following two cases: Case 1:The internationally-acclaimed volleyball playerFlo Hymanwas born withMarfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome leads individuals to have a large height and arm-span which are advantageous characteristics in a sport such as volleyball. Case 2:An athlete with fully-functioning limbs is barred from competing againstA3athletes in the Paralympics due to the unfair advantages yielded by a full set of limbs. Considering these cases in tandem, one might reasonably ask what moral standard permits Hyman’s natural advantages in volleyball while demanding separate divisions for athletes with and without a set of fully-functioning limbs. In my view, the standard to be upheld is thatoverwhelmingadvantages - rather thanmererelative advantages - constitute grounds to segregate sports. Therefore, to deny trans-women entry into women’s sports, one must demonstrate that trans-women’s athletic advantages are overwhelming such that cis-women would be effectively disenfranchised from the sporting event in question. The cross-sectional study highlights the difficulty of making such a determination. Although differences in muscle mass between pre-treatment trans-men and post-treatment trans-women are statistically significant, the range of muscle mass values for both groups is just shy of achieving complete overlap as shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, determinations of overwhelming advantages may vary by sport because different sports rely on hemoglobin levels, muscular strength, and lean body mass to different degrees. Lastly, an incidental benefit of trans-inclusion in women’s sports is the greater ability to conduct prospective studies assessing the comparative advantage of trans-athletes relative to cis-athletes. Assuming that trans-athletes are more likely to compete under more inclusive policies, researchers would be better-positioned to conduct studies with larger sample sizes and well-defined controls, leading to a more precise estimation of the relative athletic advantages that trans-women may possess over cis-women. Thus, while I take issue with the authors’ interpretation of the literature on the relationship between hormone therapy and athletic ability of trans-women, I believe a much more robust body of research is necessary to determine whether trans-athletes possess overwhelming natural advantages over cis-athletes.

stanforddaily_2022_82,"Tim MacKenzie has been a member of the Stanford community since arriving to start his PhD in the chemistry department in Fall of 2013.Any errors in the description of the budget are the author’s own, and he welcomes a response from administrators – especially a detailed breakdown of the buffer funds and how they were (or were not utilized during the height of the pandemic in 2020.He currently works as a postdoctoral researcher in the genetics department.This article is a part of a two-part series on Stanford’s budget. Part I: Introduction Stanfordrecently announcedrecord endowment returns, growing the total amount to $37.8 billion. It can be hard to find things that outpace the dizzying 52% return over five years since the endowment stood at $24.8 billionin 2017. Hard, but not impossible: health insurance costs for postdocs with dependents increasedby as much as 61%over the past two years. Campus workers alsofaced an increasein insurance premiums. But that pales in comparison to the 80%increase in premium costsgraduate students with dependents saw in the five years from 2013-2018. How is it that Stanford can simultaneously see record growth of the endowment, including nearlytwo billion dollarsin gifts for the institution’s Long Range Vision,while leavingsomeof itsmostprecarious workersinthe lurch? Why is it that when advocates point to the endowment as a potential funding source for their requests,decision makerswon’t evenentertain the idea? In arecent article, I celebrated the student activists whose efforts led the administration to make an unprecedented investment inaffordability initiatives. At the end of that article, I said that understanding how money flows in the university is an entirely different can of worms from recognizing the efforts of activists. It turns out to be more of a box of cans of worms – there is too much ground to cover in a single article. This pair of articles is intended to help demystify the endowment and operating budget at Stanford and point towards possible avenues for advocates to create enduring change. Armed with a nuanced understanding of the operating budget and endowment, advocates will be better prepared to speak for their community and identify how to make their goals reality. Part II: The Endowment Thepurpose of the endowmentis to provide “an enduring source of financial support for fulfillment of the university’s mission of teaching, learning, and research.” There is no single account with Stanford’s nearly $40 billion. Instead, there are more than 8,000 individual endowed funds, the vast majority of which have legal restrictions on what they are allowed to fund. For example, Stanford’sfounding grantforbids sale of university land, which as of 2018 was worth nearly $20 billion and made Stanford thelargest landownerin Silicon Valley. Stanford will only spend approximately 5% of thetotal valueof the endowment in a given year. So how do the funds from the endowment ensure funding for their designated purpose in perpetuity when only a small fraction of the endowment is available for use? In short, Stanford is an investment bank with a hospital, research institute, and university attached. The Stanford Management Company (SMC, whose CEO waspaid nearlynearly $4 million in 2019 invests the endowed funds, aiming for returns of approximately 10%. About half of that is used for payout to provide funds for the express purpose stipulated in the original donation. The rest is reinvested into the principal to keep pace with inflation. Without reinvesting some of the returns into the principal, inflation would eat away at the purchasing power of the endowment and future generations would not be able to access the same level of resources we can in the present. For similar reasons, anytime you do not get a pay increase that is at least as much as inflation, you are actually getting a pay cut. Postdoc salaries areincreasing by 4%this year, while inflation isover 8%– our spending power does not seem as important to the administration as the endowment’s spending power. Approximately a fifth of the yearly operating budget for the university comes from endowment payout. To ensure stability in year-to-year funding for university endeavors in the face of market volatility, managers of the endowment apply asmoothing formulato the yearly payout. Essentially, a weighted average between real and target payout with a long-term fudge factor is used instead of actual returns in an individual year. This practice helps determine the amount that gets paid out vs. reinvested to the principal in any given year, aiming to keep purchasing power equivalent every year. Especially good or bad returns in an individual year don’t cause sudden windfalls or shortcomings in the budget since SMC takes the long view. The need to protect against future downturns coupled with legal restrictions on much of the endowment payout is the reason administrators are dismissive of requests to utilize the endowment when the idea is proposed. Part III: The Operating Budget So approximately 5% of the total value of the endowment funds a fifth of the university’s operations in any given year. Where does the remaining 80% come from? A detailed breakdown of sources of revenue and expenditures for this year’s approximately $7.5 billion budget is easilyaccessible online. Every year in June, the Board of Trustees gives final approval over the yearlyoperating budgetthat was assembled throughout the academic year by the Provost and the Budget Committee and approved by the Faculty Senate in the Spring. Revenue in the yearly budget is broken down into six major categories: student income (i.e. tuition , university sponsored research (i.e. grants obtained by faculty and others , health care services (i.e. hospital income , expendable gifts, investment income (from both endowment and non-endowment sources and other income. Total income in this year’s operating budget is projected to be $7.433 billion. Spending is broken down into four categories: compensation (i.e. salary , financial aid, debt service, and other operating expenses. Total expenses in this year’s operating budget are projected to be $7.149 billion. The majority of Stanford’s non-endowed funds are referred to as the expendable funds pool (EFP , which is expected to stand at $4.9 billion by the end of this academic year. A small fraction of that is put into cash to ensure liquidity on hand for short term needs; the remainder gets invested. The merged pool investments of the EFP track closely with endowment returns. There is one crucial difference, however: the vast majority of the EFP (86% receives no payout on investment return. Nearly all of the returns from investments of the multi-billion dollar operating budget are money in the bank for Stanford. A concrete example can help illustrate the practice. Say a professor obtains a grant that funds research in their lab at a total of $1 million. That money will not be used all at once – graduate students and postdocs will get their paycheck every two weeks, experimental supplies will be bought as needed, laboratory equipment will be one-time costs, etc. While the grant funds are not being used, Stanford takes the sum total and invests that, aiming for a 10% return. If the grant were an endowed fund, a portion of the payout would be reinvested into the principal to allow the grant to fund the research project in perpetuity, but the principal itself could not be touched. Given the limited size of research grants, it is not feasible to fund a laboratory solely on investment returns; for money in the EFP, the principal is allowed to dwindle to nothing as the professor taps into their grant. Meanwhile, the university pockets all the returns from investments while the principal remains. It can be easy to get lost in the weeds while trying to understand the various funds in the operating budget and the endowment. The major takeaway to keep in mind is that the endowment and operating budget essentially operate as two separate pots of money. Only a fraction of the total value of the endowment is available in any given year, whereas the money in the operating budget represents the real flow of money in the multi-billion dollar organization that is Stanford University. This fact is a major reason that administrators are resistant to calls to employ the endowment – in any given year they only have the money in the operating budget to really utilize. However, that does not mean there are no resources to respond to calls from advocates.The next articlewill highlight parts of the operating budget that advocates can point towards as potential resources to respond to their requests.

wildcat_arizona_2022_78,"Students at University of Arizona hold a party in a frat house on March 25. With Covid-19 cases dropping the student body holds more parties to celebrate their freedom again. It feels like yesterday we all sat at our TV screens in disbelief as COVID-19 first began its tear through our lives. I was a junior in high school at the time and can remember my exact thoughts as the chaos ensued: “Are they going to cancel my junior prom?” As trivial and ridiculous as it seems now, my 16-year-old self could not fathom a world without school dances, concerts or seeing friends. After almost two years, three vaccinations and what feels like a million masks later, I reflect on the pre-pandemic version of myself with sympathy. She had no idea what was coming. None of us did. COVID-19 is a terrifying disease, and none of us have emerged unaffected by the last two years. We all had something taken from us. Some, like myself, are lucky enough to come out relatively unscathed. Sure, some of us may have missed our entire senior year, or maybe had the weirdest, most isolating year of college ever, but were able to navigate through the uncertain times without losing anyone we loved. Many Americans — many students — cannot say the same. TheNew York Timesreported 978,500 total COVID-19 deaths in America, leaving hundreds of thousands of childrenwithout their caregiversand families without their loved ones. If you can check box A, having only missed out on parties and hanging with your friends, you should feel lucky. Even so, there have been positive developments within the past few months. As I write this, we’re staring down the two-year anniversary of COVID-19 lockdowns throughout the U.S., and COVID-19 cases and deaths arefalling rapidly. Pima County dropped its mask requirements by February 28 – a date that came faster than expected. Now, even more COVID-19-cautious states — like my home state, Illinois — are electing to abandon pandemic-era safety requirements. We’re not out of the woods yet, but we’re getting closer to a post-pandemic future. That’s especially true for people who have done their part to help by getting vaccinated. Still, being at a college with such an intense party culture, I’m sure we have all heard these phrases since the pandemic began: “In the middle of a pandemic, really?” or “Stay home!” After two years, and given the fact that COVID-19 really does seem to be in retreat, according to public health authorities like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these guilt trips are unfair to the students who have done their part and gotten vaccinated. The University of Arizona reports242,960 vaccinationsfrom April 2021 to June 2021 alone. Not only is shaming these COVID-conscious students for going out unfair, it’s harmful. According to Catholic University of Milan psychology professor Cesare Cavalera, guilt can be counterproductive to positive social change. “Guilt become maladaptive to health when individuals develop an exaggerated sense of responsibility for events that occur out of their control,” Cavalerawrotein a November 2020 article. When a student has been vaccinated and or received their booster shot, they should be able to socialize freely without fear of shame or judgment. In fact, that lack of shame is crucial for addressing an ever-growing mental health crisis in our country. COVID-19 has been disastrous for mental health in the United States, especially for young people. According toa recentNew York Timesarticle, national data collected by the Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Penn State shows that loneliness and isolation are among the top concerns of college students who have sought counseling during the pandemic. For many students, going to parties and engaging in social activities helps bolster their mental health. “COVID-19 impacted my mental health so much. I was just sitting in my room and being alone all the time,” said Natalie Zabielski, a vaccinated freshman. “Just the vaccine itself and the ability to go out right now is just really helpful and my mental health has definitely improved.” Of course, some students — like those who are immunocompromised — remain more at-risk for COVID-19, even as the threat to the health of the general populace decreases. But, that’s a decision that should be left to the individual. When asked whether she would feel comfortable going to a party, immunocompromised freshman Sofija Mladjenovic gave her take. “I mean yeah, why not? Like I said, we’ve all been through so much. Going to a party is kind of normal now,” Mladjenovic said. “Whether you’re vaccinated or not, you’re going to a party where someone could have COVID-19. You’re doing it at your own risk, you don’t really know what’s going to happen.” The uncertainty of partying post-pandemic is undeniable, but here’s what I do know. We’ve all sacrificed a great deal over the past few years, and some – such as those who have lost their lives or the lives of family members – have suffered more immensely than any of us can imagine. Now more than ever, we should be kind and gentle to ourselves. We are all picking up the pieces of normalcy again. Follow Olivia Krupp onTwitter Olivia is a freshman who has yet to declare her major.

crimson_2022_143,"“Zionism is Racism, Settler Colonialism, White Supremacy, Apartheid.” On April 29, the Crimson Editorial Board, of which I am an associate editor, published aStaff Editorialthat embraced these claims, which were plastered onto the Palestinian Student Committee’s “Wall of Resistance” at the time. The Board “proudly” endorsed the associated Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, while rendering the display a “colorful” and “spirited” emblem of “passion.” The article made no mention of the fact that BDS student activismhas been tied toantisemitic exclusion and violence on college campuses. Having missed the meeting where the Board shifted its stance on BDS, I’ve spent an embarrassing number of hours puzzling over the decision, attempting to make sense of the Board’s reasoning. Yet the more I read the Staff Editorial, the more muddled its logic seemed to become. The Board, seemingly seduced by the “colorful” Wall of Resistance, directs virtually no attention to any concrete or balanced exploration of the conflict, instead evading it by stating that we “can’t nuance away” Palestinians’ lived realities. And eventually, after having evaded all precision and nuance, it blindly accepts BDS’s flawed, factually misleading mission. And now, BDS co-founder Omar Barghouti hasauthoreda Crimson letter to the editor that repeats a host of deceptive anti-Zionist talking points, recycling references to what others have dubbed “Jewish supremacy” while highlighting reports that characterize the Israeli-Palestinian relationship as a racial dispute. These declarations aren’t just wildly distorted; they’re dangerous. They paint a reductive portrait of the Jewish state, demonizing the nation and delegitimizing its very existence. But they are also provocative, evoking emotion, and are cloaked with a blanket of resonant humanitarian claims. For unknowing onlookers with a taste for justice, that seems to be all that matters. This slick dynamic, I’ve come to realize, captures the essence — and the dangerous “artistry” — of the broader BDS movement. It is my intuition that Zionism is not what the Editorial Board — or most people backing an anti-Zionist agenda in the name of justice — believes they are rejecting, or likening to racism and cruelty. Instead, they are rejecting a false projection of Zionism — one that has been carefully constructed by movements like BDS, whose entire narrative is founded upon a hefty hijacking of Jewish identity and history. BDS’s official website explicitly writes that Israel’s origins can be found within a “racist ideology” of European colonialism, which it then ties to the Zionist movement. But the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not rooted in a racial struggle, nor in an ideology of superiority or hate. On the contrary, Zionism was born in 1896 as a movement of liberation, of freedom, and of resisting unfair power imbalances during a period in which Jews across Europe were persecuted — barred from government assemblies, attacked in the press, and excluded from business dealings, hotels, social circles, and clubs. Early Zionist settlers in Palestine didn’t steal or conquer the land as they came in throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, as is the case with most European settler colonialism narratives; they bought the land. And in fact, early leaders of the Zionist movement, like Theodor Herzl, explicitly rejected the idea of displacing non-Jewish populations. Nonetheless, as the Jewish population in the region grew in the years prior to 1947, Jewish people increasingly suffered violent attacks, killings, rapes, and mass lootings from neighboring non-Jewish groups. After erasing this early history and redefining Zionism entirely, the BDS website then goes on to reduce Israel’s “violent establishment in 1948” to an act of “ethnic cleansing” against those “indigenous” to the region, designed to “uproot as many Palestinians as it can.” These words, too, reflect a complete erasure, perversion, and demonization. First of all, Jews were already indigenous to the region, as archaeological and biblical evidence has underscored. Next, Israel’s declaration of independence came only after a 1947 United Nations two-state solution was met with fierce opposition from Arab leaders — and with the burning of Jewish homes, synagogues, and murders. Most guttingly, this narrative not only ignores but subverts the post-Holocaust environment by charging Jewish people, fresh out of the Holocaust, with a “premeditated” ethnic cleansing plot. It is my suspicion that this final move reflects an effort to counter and negate the one piece of Jewish history that cannot so readily be muted or transformed. The particular form of anti-Zionist rhetoric fueled by the BDS movement isn’t just misleading — it’s also brazenly antisemitic, with its origins traceable to a KGB propaganda campaign that thrived under the leadership of KGB chairman Yuri Andropov. The campaign’s aim was to undermine the Israeli state amid its growth in the Cold War period, and igniting antisemitism was seen as a strategic means to that end. The operation’s leaders treated Hitler’s Mein Kampf as something of a bible, using it as a source of information about Zionism. In publications, the campaign circulated direct replicas of Nazi Germany caricatures that now attacked “Zionists” instead of “Jews.” The USSR also added new vilifying analogies into the mix — equating Zionism to Nazism itself, and construing Zionism as an inherently racist ideology. Today, the BDS movement has thrived upon these very tacts: At the BDS movement’s fringes,comparisonsbetween Jews and Nazis are weaponized. And at the BDS movement’s heart, the denigrating conflation of Zionism and racism continues to pulsate loudly. Today, the BDS movement’s leaders, likeBarghouti, may outwardly oppose antisemitism. But misinformation was part and parcel of what made anti-Jewish hatred, and eventually genocide, a thinkable project in Nazi Germany. It’s what turned Soviet Jews into targets ofpersecutionandhatredyears later. Now, the BDS movement is being driven by strikingly similar notes of factual manipulation. One can only expect that the inherited offshoots of this rhetoric would continue to spur antisemitic violence today. This is exactly what has taken shape amidst BDS’s expanding reach, which stretches outward onto today’s college campuses: Onereportexplicitly attributed the increase in antisemitic incidents on campuses to the rise of the BDS movement. Anti-Zionist and pro-BDS student groups also produce outright exclusion, aslegionsof college students across the country are pledging not to affiliate with pro-Israel student organizations and are isolating individual Zionist students. Sometimes, these attacks more overtly transpose themselves onto Judaism itself. Only a few years ago at Stony Brook University, a student member of the school’s pro-BDS, anti-Zionist Students for Justice in Palestine chapter was quoted in the school paper as stating, “we want Zionism off this campus, so we also want Hillel off this campus.” Jewish people are also systematically shut down by the BDS movement’s followers when they try to speak up: According to the Anti-Defamation League, a central goal of SJP, a leading source of BDS activism on college campuses, is to protest pro-Israel campus events by heckling speakers to the point of quietitude. As dialogue is stifled by anti-Zionist and pro-BDS students, vilifying slurs and monikers, new and old, also tend to make their way into the air — from referencing the trope of a “smelly Jew,” to chanting “Zionists are terrorists,” to spewing the words “f—cking Zionist.” BDS’s strategy of ideological warfare is all the more frightening because of how well it works — after all, it has led some of the most decent, kind, and thoughtful people that I know at Harvard to become patrons and propagators of antisemitism. The Board admits, still in line with past precedent, that BDS is a “blunt tool.” I believe that this tool is finer than we realize. It has been sharpened by societal forces, and historical precedents, in order to wage what is, at its core, not a fundamentally economic war of boycotts and sanctions — but a more sinister and violent ideological one. People like me — a “f-cking Zionist,” a “smelly Jew,” a modern-day “Elder of Zion” — are not simply “collateral damage” in this war. We are targets — directly wounded by signals and signs of rhetorical weaponry, and dismissed when we respond to what we know has historically been the writing on the wall. Writing this has not been easy — not just because of the complicated history, to which I have personal ties. It has also been difficult because BDS is the embodiment of everything that I have known the Board to stand against — and, in light of the Board’s failure to recognize that, I can’t help but feel a strange mix of sadness, disappointment, and fear. Back in February 2020, we opined as a Board that casting either group as “the evil one” in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a counterproductive approach, and we made an explicit call for nuance. Now, the Board has tacitly endorsed Israel’s demonization while maintaining that “we can’t nuance away” Palestinians’ lived realities. In my view, this is yet another testament to BDS’s chilling “artistry”; it is an embodiment of the fact that BDS’s messaging invokes an emotional reaction that bypasses thought at a visceral level. When nuance is present, it becomes harder to demonize one party — so BDS does all that it can to reject that complexity and thought. This negation of nuance doesn’t just enable the mobilization of age-old antisemitic machinery. It also fuels discord and division, when what themitigationand eventualresolutionof this conflict most desperately need is unity, objectivity, and even-handed advocates calling for peace. Still, I have to believe that we all fundamentally want to pursue progress, productive dialogue, and peace — it’s just that some of us were seduced, by misinformation and “passion,” into thinking that BDS could get us there. I don’t know what you see. Maybe it’s color; maybe it’s spirit. I see a violent history that has been reproduced in a camouflaged modern-day form. Gemma J.

state_press_2022_36,"ASU then-freshman infielder and right-handed pitcher Ethan Long (35 prepares to bat against Cal State Fullerton on Saturday, March 13, 2021. ASU won 6-4. As many baseball fans know, aMLB lockoutwas implemented on Dec. 2, 2021, effectively banning players from returning to practice facilities, and making it harder to obtain team-issued health benefits. Owners and players couldn t come to a new collective bargaining agreement so the owners decided to lock the players out of the team facilities. The lockout has already affected players in the league by restricting access to team-licensed doctors and physical therapists, among many other issues, but the problems surrounding a lockout spread far beyond just the professional ranks. The way I see it, baseball is run by the players, not the owners. If there is a continued lockout this season, ASU could lose out on an opportunity to be close to spring training, which could be in jeopardy due to the slow negotiations. ASU baseball has become a hotspot for professional scouts over the years, due to the proximity of the University tospring training. Eddie Bane, a former national scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers and a Sun Devil alum explained in anarticlefrom Sun Devils Athleticsthat, Arizona State is isolated, it s the only game in town for college baseball, unlike the Southern California area. Every club has a scout in the area, so players get seen more often by pro scouts. ASU leads Division 1 college baseball inoverall draft pickswith 455. The closest is the University of Texas with 356. A key reason for ASU s ranking is that more scouts watch the University s baseball team during spring training, getting to interact with prospects one-on-one. This was a huge advantage prior to the internet. Many people would argue there really is no advantage to being so close to spring training action anymore because, as ASU lecturer and sports ethics and philosophy expert Shawn Klein explained, before scouts even go and look at a player, they have probably looked at a tremendous amount of video of the player already. But no matter how many clips have been watched, this does not account for how the player will interact with the team. There s a lot of metrics you could look at, but then there are other things that you still need that personal connection to actually get that relationship, Klein said. You can only see so much on the video, you can only see so much in their stats. Building a report on a player s personality is a huge part of the scouting process because there really is only so much you can tell by the numbers. ASU is one of the best places for prospects to come in hopes of getting looked at by MLB scouts; scouts still love coming to games in-person to get a good read on a player s personality and to see how that player fits into a dugout. If not scouts, some players actually enjoy going to amateur games and trying their hand at scouting, just likeZack Greinkedid when he was with the Diamondbacks. Scouting amateur players is a hobby for Zack Greinke - how was his evaluation of Dustin Pedroia & Prince Fielder?https: t.co/HOHQ622sML There is a correlation between scouting and the teams that come to play in Arizona for college tournaments, said Klein. You have a lot of smaller and larger schools that do come out and play in a lot of tournaments that are often right around spring training down here, he said. Likely that s just because you have the teams, you have the scouts, you have the other college teams all going on all at once, so there s probably a bit of an economy of scale there for everybody. If there is an economy of scale for everybody, then wouldn t there be an advantage for the team that plays home games just minutes away from spring training action? Ultimately, if spring training doesn t happen, the Sun Devils lose their advantage over other schools when it comes to scouting. This story was updated on Jan. 27, 2022 at 1:30 p.m. to clarify claims about the possible postponement of spring training. Reach the reporter atjdhinkl1@asu.eduand follow@JeffreyHinkle_on Twitter.

thetech_mit_2022_63,"I stepped away from writing opinion editorials to focus on fiction and my responsibilities outside of writing. However, I have been pondering a few questions and like babies they now yearn to break their long silence with a forceful cry. Before I remark on my purpose in writing, I must first acknowledge the friend whose own writing moved me to pick up this pen — Ufuoma Ovienmhada. Inher speech at the MIT 2022 Celebration of Martin Luther King Jr.’s life, Ovienmhada carefully articulated that she “Loves MIT;” she cites the beloved bell hooks (1952–2021 who said, “There can be no love without justice,” and, “The heart of justice is truth telling.” She also offers the definition bell hooks used for love, from M. Scott Peck who defined love as “The will to extend oneself for the purpose of nurturing one’s own or another’s spiritual growth.” Ovienmhada acknowledges that the three truths she offers about MIT may be difficult to hear or embrace, however we are reminded again at the end of her speech of bell hooks’ love ethic, to which Ovienmhada’s speech gracefully pays tribute. We would all do well to listen to bell hooks. We would all do well to listen to Ovienmhada. In a similar spirit, I have been thinking about the growing movement for a graduate student labor union at MIT. A movement, as I understand it, to form a legal entity with the ability to ensure equity, equality, fairness, and justice on the part of MIT toward graduate students. This movement is steadily garnering support with digital and print media, forums and mixers, canvassing and phone banking, and other investments of time by graduate students, for graduate students. I am encouraged by their steadfast work, knowing full well that they are not only fightingfora labor union, butagainstmisinformation from authority and aversions to the imagination by members of the MIT community. Still, these students find the strength and muster the courage to organize for a labor union despite their reality of being overworked and underappreciated. This context serves as the foundation to my two questions: Why are graduate students seeking to form a labor union at MIT?Which is to say, why are graduate students choosing to fight in what is a long battle for a labor union, knowing not only the contentious history of forming labor unions in this country but also that they’d be fighting against a 160-year-old institution of higher education backed by plentiful financial and legal resources controlled by thesenior leadershipand theCorporation? And nascently,is there not an easier way to fulfill thedemandsof these graduate students?Demands such as: (1 fair work expectations and all the resources required to do their jobs effectively; (2 a safe and equitable work environment with dependable accountability; (3 financial security and guaranteed support; (4 affordable housing and comprehensive benefits; (5 equal academic and professional opportunities for international students.Fair. Safe. Equitable. Dependable. Security. Support. Affordable. Equal.All of their demands sound reasonable, so why do they need a labor union to convince MIT to fulfill them? Forming a labor union has historically been done to transfer power from the employer to the employed. I am thinking of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP which was founded in Harlem in 1925 by African American railroad porters and maids at the Pullman Company. Yet, the battle for the BSCP truly started 60 years before, when in the name of inclusion Pullman allowed newly liberated and formerly enslaved folks to work at his company, while taking advantage of their needs by demanding long hours of hard work with poor compensation. Pullman used his power to say that the workers could accept the conditions or quit. Instead, they unionized to fight back and chose a fitting motto — “Fight or Be Slaves.” I am also thinking of the graduate students at New York University who were the first of their kind at a private university to unionize and negotiate a contract with their administration for a living wage, better health care, and greater protections against harassment and discrimination (2001 . Although this initial unionization was short-lived due to legal retaliation by NYU (the union’s contract expired in 2005 and wasn’t recognized again until 2013 , the pioneering success and a semester-long strike by the NYU graduate students is both commendable in its felicity and inspiring in its landmark success. Labor unions have been created either proactively using knowledge of the contentious history of workers in this country; or, more often, reactively to an extensive series of unjust violations by an employer that warrants the employed to unionize. The movement for a graduate student labor union at MIT seems to be an example of the latter. Yet, it may not be clear how, because the senior leadership purports that “students are what make MIT” and even recently have spoken with language of support for a graduate student labor union, when in actuality MIT has no desire to give up decision-making power, and understandably so — giving up power means giving up control. MIT may proffer to inform the community about labor unions, yet it continually fails to center the stories of the very students who seek this labor union. And though MIT acts on what it says, its actions continually fall short of its word. Yes, entities echoing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI in their halls are likely preferential toward establishing a labor union. But, an entity which only purports to live these values will work behind closed doors to dismantle efforts which challenge their power and strategically stall the progress a labor union promises to their employees — a group which unequivocally includes graduate students . Those who organize to form labor unions are neither irrational nor impulsive. Those who organize to form labor unions are critical thinkers driven by necessity. It would not surprise me if this necessity stems from the fatigue of graduate students who have endured decades upon decades of neglect by MIT. Thus, forming a union should not be contextualized as graduate students’ first straw, but the next one (maybe thelaststraw after decades of trying to work with MIT to solve graduate student problems. Graduate students are taking their livelihoods into their own hands to protect themselves and their wellbeing. In this way, the growing movement for a graduate student labor union at MIT is not separate from the legacy of labor union movements in the United States — it is a part of this legacy. We should be applauding their efforts and supporting their movement with self-invested action. I remember joining my first labor union. At first, I was skeptical due to what I had heard about unions, but all my coworkers were enthusiastic about it, so I felt open to considering joining. I read the documentation and I remembered my grandfather, Richard, who fought against Phillip Morris for decades as part of a labor union. I joined. A couple months into the job, I realized I was underpaid and expected to work ridiculous hours. I was slower to realize I was paying for this with my emotional, physical, and psychological well-being. I remember learning that most of my coworkers felt the same way, so it became an item of business in the union meeting. It is not easy to share legitimate concerns with an employer (especially around work conditions and pay , but the union offered me community and allowed my voice to join a chorus of other workers’ voices. Shortly after the legal negotiations with our employer (which a union enables , our pay increased to better reflect our value and our hours were reduced to better match our needs. More than that, I remember learning how the union restored my agency as a worker, which I initially did not know was mine to have because of the way I was conditioned to believe the world works: a world where being a worker means sublimating one s frustrations into pleasing so-called ‘superiors,’ where the fear of losing job security is the stimulus for one’s productivity and the reason for turning a blind eye, and yes, a world where going to graduate school means unavoidable suffering through the coursework and lab work and PIs and faculty and putting up with it all at the cost of one’s health. I refuse to accept this world. Especially, when we live in a country where labor unions exist. In this spirit I am reminded of the late Toni Morrison (1931-2019 , who said, “Don’t let anybody, anybody convince you this is the way the world is and therefore must be. It must be the way it ought to be.” Labor unions at their best ensure the working world is how it ought to be, and — most importantly — the members of the union hold the power to dictate that “how.” During my five years at the Institute — after building relationships with people in the Office of the President, Office of the Chancellor, Office of the Provost; after building relationships with faculty, staff, students, and alumni; after serving this school and the greater MIT community out of love — I have learned that MIT’s number one priority is its capital, both tangible (i.e., physical property and intangible (i.e., intellectual property and global reputation . The evidence for my claim is found in the stories of students across the Institute and over decades, students like myself who have labored incessantly for life and against death at MIT — to foster DEI as values and not commodities to be exploited for good press; to foster a thriving student community where people are valued as individuals and not merely laborers who produce intellectual property they will never own; and to foster a “truth telling” spirit that rejects the myth of neutrality on issues of justice. We should not need a labor union. We should not need to form a legally-binding entity to negotiate with MIT on issues concerning graduate student life. Graduate students should not have to go to these lengths to be heard and respected. That is, if the students and MIT are on the same page. But, we are not on the same page and have not been for decades. That is why the need for a graduate student union is aneed, not a want. I use communal language — “we” and “us” — in this writing, because it is important to remember this fight is a collective effort. As my fraternity brother Rev. Dr. King (1929-1968 stated, “Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This is the interrelated structure of reality.” The time is now for us to rise together. Let us refuse to succumb to apathy. Let us refuse to embrace the myth of neutrality. It is on all of us to help the graduate students restore their agency. It is on all of us to ensure that the graduate student labor union comes to life. And who knows? We all might finally come to life right along with it. Kelvin Green II is an undergraduate senior in Course 8 with minors in Courses 21W and 21L.

To us, this means the MOB, and the quirky side of Rice that we represent better than anything else, is unwelcome in Rice’s cold, corporate public image as it seems to reject the “unconventional wisdom” it uses as a selling point. For decades, the MOB’s incarnation as the Basketball Owl Band has performed at dozens of basketball games each season, lead crowd chants, and put on comedic half-time shows. If waving our cutouts of memes while wearing Aloha shirts can’t attract the crowds Athletics is looking for, then a run-of-the-mill pep band, with no energy to give outside of their stand tunes, will fail. String and miscellaneous instruments obviously don’t fit that insipid sameness of nearly every other basketball band that Athletics wants to copy. Violins are hardly even audible over percussion and wind instruments, so Athletics must think the mere sight of unexpected instruments risks frightening off attendees. But James, the MOB’s accordionist, can readily affirm the opposite: He and fellow members of the Stringatronics section, like our cellist and ukulelist, bring a wow factor that nothing can come close to replicating. Upon introducing himself and mentioning he plays accordion in the MOB, people have frequently responded with admiration: “You’re the accordionist? I’ve seen you! That’s so cool!” Athletics doesn’t grasp what would be ruined by excising this instrumentation. Alumni and community members are excluded, purportedly because it would be too complicated to pay them, but this easily remedied obstacle is a poor excuse. To Kaitlyn, a clarinetist, the MOB has been an accessible alternative to the traditional college marching band experience — a way to unwind a few times a week with friends, and without the pressure of mandatory rehearsals or games. Rice students are perpetually busy, because even outside of heavy course loads, so many of us devote our free time to more than just one passion. In the fifty years since Rice’s marching band was reborn as the MOB, it has scattered instead of marched, and welcomed members regardless of their musical prowess or ability to show up consistently. This structure acknowledges the reality of life at Rice, and for decades has given Rice a more comprehensive band than it may have had otherwise. We’re skeptical that the Owl Pep Band can fill its roster from the talent pool to which it’s restricted. MOBsters devote countless hours throughout basketball season because they get to do it with their friends amid an invigorating atmosphere. The offer of money can’t get students to audition and commit to 30 games in that same way. Ryan would have conducted the BOB as its drum minor but is eligible to audition for the new pep band as a trombonist. To him, being stripped of such a privilege while being asked to join this new band is insulting. The stated motivations behind this band don’t come close to justifying the disregard and ungratefulness shown to so many MOBsters, who sacrificed their time for no compensation. Rather than lend the MOB a modicum of support, Athletics would demolish a vibrant instance of campus life and spend thousands of dollars per week on a substitute with embarrassingly little thought put into it. We doubt throwing money in such a manner at what is ultimately a sideshow attraction will earn them back that investment. This decision disturbingly echoesRice’s sale of KTRUin 2010, which also happened without consulting its members. Both undermine student autonomy and Rice’s connection to its alumni and wider community. Despite the assurances we’ve been given, we can see a simple answer to the inevitable next question: If the BOB doesn’t fit the university’s image for its new conference, how does the MOB at all? We call on Rice Athletics to reinstate the Basketball Owl Band — and to motivate this, for student musicians to join us in boycotting the Owl Pep Band. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_11,"Her name meaning “miracles”, mi mamá is 5’8” with curly, brown pelo malo and a warm smile and laugh. Her skin is freckled by the sun, an imprint of her youth in Puerto Rico. And oh, how I love how she speaks — in English and Spanish. Beyond what meets the eye and ear is a brilliant woman — the first in her family to leave the island, get a Ph.D., and surpass socioeconomic barriers limiting those before her. Milagros don’t happen without hard work, and to that, she is the epitome of her name. To me, she is incredible and beautiful. But to many, it is hard to look past what meets the eye and ear, and they hastily make assumptions about her. Growing up, I never thought mamá sounded different from my friends’ parents. But although I felt she spoke like everyone else, everyone else thought she spoke like “Puerto Rico.” I ceased to hear her voice from her mouth and began to hear it only through the warped tongue of others. Each instance of people mocking her accent and gleefully using it to enhance their punchlines distorted my perception of what it meant to be Puerto Rican. I became increasingly aware of others’ impatient facial expressions at the start of her sentences and realized that her experience as a Puerto Rican in America was far more different than I’d imagined. When mamá came to Iowa for graduate school, she spent most of her time with international students. They bonded over how professors spoke obnoxiously slow to them, how classmates mocked their accents, or how they missed home (especially during the freezing Iowa winters . The frequent microaggressions from American students and professors led her to find comfort with those who shared her identity as an outsider — but she did not find this comfort in other Hispanic students. Partly in an attempt to escape the Puerto Rican stereotype and partly due to prejudice within the community, mamá sought non-Hispanic companions. The Latin American diaspora is wonderfully diverse: Each Spanish-speaking province and nation has a unique history and substantial differences in their Spanish. However, this uniqueness is unfortunately not always celebrated in the Hispanic community; Western influence and colonization have sowed divisions and created a hierarchy of Latine ethnicities. Within this hierarchy, there exists the stereotype that Puerto Ricans don’t speak the “right” type of Spanish. The quick and informal nature of the Puerto Rican dialect has birthed the untrue assumption that Puerto Ricans are less intelligent by nature. With every other Hispanic nation claiming to have the “better Spanish” while generally looking down upon Boricuas, a world absent of this divide feels impossible. Even within the Caribbean, western beauty standards stemming from colonization influence how Latine individuals are judged and judge each other.Pelo malois linked with being unkempt, lower-class, and dirty, while pelo lacio is smooth, desirable, beautiful, and professional. This same narrative exists in America, making up yet another layer in our intricate web of biases. Because accents have become the flag bearers of stereotypes, Puerto Ricans often struggle between quiet assimilation and being proud of our heritage. Puerto Rican history, traditions, and even our importance in the American political eye have diminished due to the stereotype staining our reputation. There is also a double standard in America between Western and non-Western accents. People are drawn to narrators like David Attenborough and relatedly find British people more intelligent, sophisticated, and attractive simply because of their type of accent. This is not a privilege Puerto Ricans, Hispanics, and other non-Western people have. British people are a blend of familiarity and foreignness, tolerably exotic. Since the cultural similarities between Americans and Brits are greater, Americans feel comfortable with their othering qualities. But due to xenophobia ingrained in American society, anything too different is scary. So, we assign assumptions to the people we don’t understand, thus birthing stereotypes that perpetuate cultural divides. Accents tell a story that we will never begin to understand unless we listen. Our general impatience for those who speak differently burns the bridge between their unique perspectives and our own. And let’s not forget that Hispanic accents typically mean that person knows at least two languages —more than the average American. But not all is bad for non-native English speakers. Mamá described a silver lining to being Puerto Rican in America: her accent provides comfort. She is known for translating for Hispanic families in my town’s public schools. Sometimes at the supermarket, strangers ask her in Spanish questions they didn’t feel comfortable asking the employees. She even expressed how it was only after she came to America that she learned to love her pelo malo after years of straightening it, wearing it naturally to emphasize her identity to others. The connections Mamá’s identity allows her to make are beautiful, and so is being Boricua. It’s about time America hears and sees this beauty too.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_49,"After 27 hours of deliberations,the verdict was read. “As to the first count of the information … we, the jury, find the defendant, Kyle H. Rittenhouse not guilty.” The same verdict was repeated for all charges. Kyle Rittenhouse, who killed two people and injured a third during a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wis. was found not guilty on all counts. In the summer of 2020, Black Lives Matter protests erupted across the country in response to the murder ofGeorge Floyd. Floyd, an unarmed Black man, who died with a white police officer’s knee on his neck. Activists were calling for justice for Floyd and the countless other Black people who have been the victim of police violence. As the summer went on the movement’s epicenter moved to different cities as the news spread of yet another Black individual harmed by police violence. Late in the summer, the movement’s center shifted to Kenosha, Wis. after police shot and partially paralyzedJacob Blake. The protests in Kenosha were attended by thousands of people from across the country. However, after law enforcement officials began tear gassing protestors, protestors responded by throwing water bottles and fire crackers. This violence caused multiple fires to start and buildings to burn. The heightened news coverage of the violence led to dangerous generalized rhetoric of the protesters. BLM protesters were often depicted as violent and destructive, when in actuality,most protesters remained peaceful.This rhetoric led outside groups who often opposed the Black Lives Matter movement to feel the need to intervene. What set the protests in Kenosha apart from others was the large presence of armed individuals who came to assist law enforcement. A Facebook group entitled the “Kenosha Guard” gained a following during the protests. The group, which sought out “armed citizens to protect our lives and property,” traveled to Kenosha with the hopes of protecting the city from who they referred to as “evil thugs.” Members of these self-proclaimed militias, including then 17-year-old Rittenhouse, hoped to act as an extension of the law enforcement despite having no law enforcing powers. Some law enforcement members can even be seen thanking members of these groups for their support and giving them water invideos from the protests. The inability for law enforcement to reject the militia group’s involvement outright allowed the protests to quickly become more volatile. The influx of heavily armed people without any attachment to law enforcement caused tensions to rise. Rittenhouse,armed with an AR-15, traveled to Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020. Heconsidered himselfa member of a militia that traveled to Kenosha to protect businesses and people. Later that night he shot Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum, and injured Gaige Grosskreutz. Rosenbaum had allegedly chased Rittenhouseinto a car lot and threw a plastic bag at him, leading Rittenhouse to shoot and kill him. After the first shooting, Rittenhouse ran away and was shortly after pursued by several protesters who thought he was an active shooter. He then shot and killed Huber and injured Grosskreutz as they were trying to apprehend him. Rittenhouse’s defense claimed that he fired in anact of self-defense, which was ultimately believed to be true by the jury.Wisconsin’s self-defense lawsallow an individual to take action if they feel they are threatened, even if they do not attempt to retreat or neutralize the situation. Unlike most states, Wisconsin allows an individual to use excessive force even if they provoked the violent situation. This made it very difficult for the jury to prove that his actions were not out of self-defense. Although frustrating for many, the jury was not deciding whether Mr. Rittenhouse’s actions were overarchingly fair. They were posed with a certain set of laws and asked to apply the given facts to them. However, the problem is not with what the jury concluded, it is with the systemic disparities in our justice and law enforcement systems. After Rittenhouse had shot the two men he ran towards law enforcement with his hands up, still in possession of the AR-15. As he was approaching them, the law enforcement officialsordered him to get out of the wayso they could find the shooter. The national guard and other officials never considered that the white 17-year-old walking towards them with a weapon could be the shooter. He was immediately discounted and was provided with the luxury of being able to return home and turn himself in. The biases of the law enforcement officials that night were clear, just as they were when Floyd was killed and Blake was shot. The disappointing story of Rittenhouse showcases many of America’s problems, from police brutality to questionable laws that enable violence. We as Americans have an obligation to fight to reform these issues to ensure a more just future for generations to come. Claire Schad is an Opinion Staff Writer. She can be reached atschadc@uci.edu."
state_press_2022_61,"ASU police parked on a pedestrian path on the Tempe campus Wednesday, Sept. 21 2022. As fiery political rhetoric about crime is spread online, an estimated 270,000 homicide or missing person cases sit cold in the U.S since 1980, and thousands more unsolved cases are added every year. You might share posts that blame homicides on the unregulated accessibility of guns. Or maybe something that points to understaffed and underfunded law enforcement agencies. Perhaps you blame drugs. Or toxic masculinity. Or the breakdown of the traditional family. Or generational trauma. If you’re convinced some of these are to blame, you’re likely angered by the mere suggestion of the others. But amplifying those divisive messages does nothing to address the problem and ignoring how it might affect the families of victims is callous and exploitative. While no universal definition exists, a case is considered cold when there are no more leads, and usually, after a long period of time has passed – typically between a year and four years, according to theNational Institute of Justice. Each cold case is an unresolved crime, leaving families who are already struggling to make sense of a world that took away their family member to process another unthinkable injustice: when that tragedy is seemingly forgotten. “A lot of these families, a number of them, their world stopped the day their loved one was murdered,” said Ryan Backmann, founder and executive director atProject: Cold Case, a nonprofit working with families and law enforcement to help solve cold cases through providing publicity to all cases, not just those in the public eye. Backmann’s father was killed in Jacksonville, Florida in 2009, and he started Project: Cold Case in 2015. He’s found helping other families who are grappling with loss to be cathartic, but he is often reminded of his own grief. “Every time there’s my birthday, every time there’s a holiday, those memories and what we are missing out on are brought to the forefront,” Backmann said. Backmann spoke at the first annualCold Case Symposium, which was held at theNew College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Scienceson ASU’s West campus on Sept. 23 duringNational Forensic Science Week. Families, Experts Shed Light on Cold Case Crisis at Symposiumhttps: t.co/7tLIMIHR2D#forensicscience#forensics#evidence#LawEnforcement#investigtions#forensicscienceacademy#fingerprint#DNApic.twitter.com/71NcEz2L4Z Lauren Weidner, assistant professor in the School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences, organized the event. She prefers to focus on advocacy and awareness. “Nobody wants cases to go cold, there’s probably a bunch of different reasons for why they did. And there’s probably a lot of people blaming people,” Weidner said. “Playing the blame game never really helps anything move forward.” People may assume, as I did, that science and technological advancements would help improve clearance rates over time, but they have actually gone down over the past 60 years, according to theMurder Accountability Project. Last year just over half of the over 14,000 homicides were solved, compared to over 70% in 1980 and almost 85% in 1965. The issue affects Arizona, too. Since 1980, the Phoenix Police Department has closed about 60% of homicides in the city.Between 2010 to 2020, Phoenix closed 1,014 of 1,454 homicides, a rate of 69%. Merely determining an accurate count of cold cases is a challenge. These numbers are based on the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report, which is only as accurate as the information provided by agencies, which the American Civil Liberties Union warns can be manipulated. There are over 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the U.S., and with no standard definition of cold cases, departments submit counts to the FBI based on different criteria. To address the lack of police data transparency which contributes to this issue and other issues of police accountability, The Vera Institute of Justice created aPolice Data TransparencyIndex. The institute assigned scores to 94 cities and counties, covering a quarter of the U.S. population earlier this year, using the samecrime reportingcriteria used to track cold cases. Fourteen jurisdictions received a zero because they do not provide crime report information at all. On a scale of 100, the median score was 44. Not reporting this information makes it impossible to understand the full extent of the issue, which makes efforts to address it more difficult. However we choose to count, thousands of families every year are left with no explanation, no closure, and nothing but perpetual grief. The number of cold cases will never be zero. Despite what we see on television, sometimes cases are unsolvable. There’s no evidence. No witnesses come forward. But sometimes just passing along information can have an impact. Like the signs in New York subways say, If you see something, say something, said Weidner. “We don’t necessarily need to reach a million people, we need to reach one,” said Backmann. “But we may have to go through a million to get to that one.” There must be more that can be done than waiting for that one-in-a-million chance of a witness coming forward after years of silence. I’m not advocating for increased funding, though. Project: Cold Case advocates for departments to have a dedicated Cold Case unit. Only 7% of departments today do, according to the NIJ. Nor do I place the sole blame on police departments, though building community trust and providing more data transparency would likely improve clearance rates. We need to cut through the politics of the law and order debate and focus on addressing this growing problem. By liking the Project: Cold CaseFacebookpage, you can expand their reach. Learn about the cold cases where you live, and whether local departments have a dedicated team to continue investigations. Call for department leaders to prioritize data transparency and cold cases. Also, the next time there is extensive coverage around a single unsolved tragedy, consider how that attention might affect the families of so many others whose world stopped while the rest of the world kept on going.

crimson_2022_114,"When he was 28, Albert Camus began writing a novel about a plague. La Peste, or The Plague, tells the story of Oran, a strikingly ordinary town in French Algeria. In sober prose, Camus details the profoundly typical lives of the townsfolk as they go through their daily motions. Then the rats begin to die. Dr. Bernard Rieux, a dark-skinned man with close-cropped black hair, begins warning the authorities. He is the first to use the word “plague”, prompting the horror and disbelief of the higher-ups. However, they hesitate to sound the alarm because panic leads to economic disruptions and hurts chances for re-election. Eventually, Rieux’s frantic attempts to stave off the pestilence transform into futility, as he is left to inject serum and lance abscesses, waiting for the inevitable death of his patients. Camus isn’t pointing towards stupidity or politicization as the cause of death of half of Oran’s population, as recent movies like “Don’t Look Up” seem to do. Instead, Camus touches on an aspect of human nature that is much more profound and at times unavoidable. Simply put, the citizens of Oran were “like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves; in other words they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences.” Most of us have never experienced death because, well, if we had, we’d be dead. We can never truly learn the lesson of the inevitability of our own death because we lack experience. Like the people of Oran, most of us have lived our lives under the pretense of immortality, protected from death by the illusory shield of probability. Some of us, through a friend or loved one, have been shaken awake to the absurdity and inevitability of death, but for the most part, The Plague tells the story of a universal human condition. As Camus writes, “Everybody knows that pestilences have a way of recurring in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe in ones that crash down on our heads from a blue sky.” Why did it take so long for Harvard todivestfrom fossil fuels? Aside from the many moral arguments, divestment was smart because it protected the environment in which we live. However, from the comfort of Cambridge, climate change is so detached from our realities that we refuse to recognize its truth. The people of Oran had rats dying in the streets, and they still refused to wake up from their stupor of comfort. Many of us haven’t watched our houses become flooded by rising sea levels, so we are left with numbers on a screen to serve as warnings. Yet numbers aren’t enough. Most of us don’t believe in climate change. Sure, we accept the facts, recognize the scientific truth. However, until Harvard’s campus isflooded by rising tides, most of us will never really grasp its reality. This isn’t an optimistic op-ed about how if we all sober up, we can band together to solve the climate crisis. This isn’t even a deceivingly cynical op-ed meant to be proven wrong by do-gooders. This is, instead, a simple exposition of my personal opinion: that Harvard’s inability to recognize the gravity of the situation at hand only confirms Camus’ view of humanity’s disbelief in death. It doesn’t matter how manymultimillion-dollar eco-allegoriesare made, or how many hours peoplepicket in frontof the stoic statue of John Harvard. Humanity won’t believe in climate change until the evidence begins impacting our daily lives and we are jolted awake by the truth. Climate change isn’t a unique situation. It isn’t a sort of punishment for humanity’s arrogant actions, nor is it meant to impose universal justice. Instead, it is an absurd and chance concentration in time of the inescapable underlying condition which afflicts us all: the reality that our lives hang on a string, and that at any time, that string may snap. If we manage to escape the climate crisis, a more deadly pandemic will be next, or some other sort of natural or human-made catastrophe. The truth is, we’re all going to die, and there’s not much we can do to change that. This isn’t meant to discredit the efforts of the Divest movement or everyone else who is valiantly fighting against climate change. The answer to this game that we are bound to lose isn’t to flip the board over and walk away. Instead, it’s to continue playing, to work long hours lancing abscesses of patients that are inevitably going to die, as Dr. Rieux does. The solution is to be decent. As Camus writes, “There’s no question of heroism in all this. It’s a matter of common decency. That’s an idea which may make some people smile, but the only means of righting a plague is common decency.” What is decency? Perhaps an answer can be found in the wisdom of Dr. Rieux: “I don’t know what it means for other people. But in my case I know that it consists in doing my job.” Manny A.

thetech_mit_2022_34,"In 1978, just two years before I began my MIT journey, I was interested in American postal history. While I was visiting Washington, D.C., I stopped by the L’Enfant Plaza headquarters of the U.S. Postal Service. I wanted to explore their library. While the treasure trove of books and artifacts was set up largely for postal employees, there were no obstacles to a 15-year-old simply walking into the building, taking the elevator to the desired floor, and spending many hours among the stacks and shelves. My work there that day led to a project which resulted in my doing volunteer work at the United Nations, and that work in turn led to a significant topic discussed at my MIT admissions interview. A few months before the pandemic began, I had a chance to stay at a hotel right next door to the USPS headquarters. I headed over to see if the library was still there. At the front door, I was eyed with suspicion. Yes, there’s a library, and yes, it remains open to the public, but one cannot actually walk into the building to get there. Someone needs to come down from the library to fetch you. After waiting ten minutes, the librarian appeared to escort me upstairs. He, too, looked at me suspiciously. When I reached the library, I realized why. There were no other people there. The librarian shared that I was the first non-postal employee to come to the library in months, largely because no one can get in unless he happens to be free to come downstairs. But he simultaneously followed me everywhere, still concerned that I might be there for nefarious purposes. If a 15-year-old were to show up at the headquarters now, I’m afraid that individual wouldn’t have a chance of getting in, certainly wouldn’t be given unfettered access, and perhaps would never end up following a career path which otherwise would have been productive and enjoyable. While at MIT, one of my favorite activities was to walk around campus, often late at night, just to see what there was. What labs existed that I didn’t know about? What bulletin board postings told of lectures or meetings outside my usual stomping ground? What students might also be roaming about and eager for a late night talk? In my years as an alum, I have often stopped by campus just to make the rounds and to see what new experiences might be possible. Writing about all the activities and experiences of my life which began with such walks would take pages. I’m sad to see MIT following in the footsteps of our rapidly eroding freedom, all in the name of reducing risk. Showing an ID, dealing with limited access, and going through security checks have all become the norm. Not being allowed to explore is now the routine. Our nation has become so dangerous, so risk-averse, and so suspicious that we have erected the equivalent of barbed wire around the heart of our Institute. I’m sad to think of the young people who don’t have the opportunities that used to be so abundant. I’m sad that even those of us who are part of the MIT community have restrictions that were never previously perceived as necessary. And I wonder … how do we get our freedom back? Stuart Gitlow ’84"
crimson_2022_3,"Long before Allston-Brighton became nice, my best friends and I would take long walks around the neighborhood for fun. There was nowhere to go and not much to see except for the Tedeschi’s on the corner of Market and Faneuil and McKinney Field just a block and a half down the street. It became something of a tradition for us: Every day after school, we’d play two-hand-touch in our khaki pants and dress shoes, buy Little Debbie Honey Buns in obscene quantities, and roam around our simple, unpretentious neighborhood. Then cameNew Balance. And thenthe Lantera.The Aberdeen.The Saybrook. Harvard. It’s no secret that Harvard’s property development is contributing to the rapid gentrification of Allston-Brighton. The University owns aboutone-thirdof Allston, which houses Harvard Business School, Harvard’s athletic facilities, and the new Science and Engineering Complex. Stillpending state approvalare the Enterprise Research Campus on Western Avenue and the development of the old Beacon Park Rail Yard by the Massachusetts Turnpike. Private developers, in anticipation of Harvard’s expansion into Allston-Brighton, have been eager to capitalize on what Boston officialssayis the biggest building boom in the city’s history. But what about the people who actually live here? While Boston officials and real estate developers are busy putting Allston-Brighton on the map, we have been struggling to pay rent in a time of pandemic and racial reckoning. Our diverse community, faced with mounting housing insecurity and social tension, has become a breeding ground for hate. With land values increasing and new luxury apartment buildings popping up every few months, the average rent in Allston-Brighton for a non-luxury two-bedroom apartment has increased by more than 38 percent over the last five years, from$1,807in 2016 to$2,500in 2021. And as rent goes up, people get pushed out. It is no coincidence that Boston is ranked thethird-most“intensely gentrified” city in the United States and that Massachusetts ranksfirstin the growth of family homelessness. Consider, too, that Allston-Brighton’s population ismade upof 30 percent people of color, with immigrants from every corner of the globe. These factors — combined with increased media coverage of anti-blackpolice brutalityin other major American cities and President Trump’sinsinuationsabout China’s role in the Covid-19 pandemic — coincide with the City of Boston recording anall-time highof 355 hate incidents in 2020. During the pandemic, my two best friends and I settled back into our old tradition of walking around the neighborhood after nearly five years of being too busy to hang out regularly. Only this time, there were a lot of places to go and a lot of things to see. At the top of our list were the new restaurants in Allston-Brighton, where everybody knows you can find the best Korean food in all of Boston. I remember waiting with my friends to pick up our takeout dinner from Coreanos, when a middle-aged white man, sitting on a nearby bench with tattered clothes and a knapsack, interrupted our conversation and asked, “Are you guys from China?” The only thing I could bring myself to say was no. It wasn’t a lie either — two of us were Filipino and the other was Chinese American, born right here in Allston-Brighton. “Oh, you guys are from here?” We nodded. He left us alone after that. I couldn’t help but think that we had just barely escaped something more serious. On another night, my two friends and I were coming back from dinner on Harvard Avenue when an elderly white man, sitting on a bench with a flushed face and bottles at his feet, asked for the time before narrowing his eyes and pointing at us, demanding to know if we were Chinese. My friend and I both responded that we were Filipino. I closed my eyes in anticipation of my other friend’s response: “I’m Vietnamese, man,” he said, his voice breaking at the lie. There was a lump in the back of my throat. We walked in silence for several blocks afterwards. I still wonder what would have happened if he had told the truth. The crux of the matter is this: If you take an ethnically diverse neighborhood whose residents are being forced out of their homes and onto the streets and you infuse it with hateful sentiment, you get a community fractured along race and class lines. The totality of our experience tends to get overlooked when it comes to discussions about gentrification in Allston-Brighton. There is far more at stake here than winning state approval for development projects and rising property values — we’re hurting, and we need to find a way to heal. It’s time for Harvard to start paying attention to what its expansion is doing to the Allston-Brighton community. Francis Immanuel N.

wildcat_arizona_2022_39,"Protesters gather in front of Old Main on Sept. 30 to talk about the injustices happening to the Iranian people. People gathered to spread awareness about Mahsa Amini’s death, after authorities arrested and killed her for allegedly breaking the strict Islamic dress code. Protesters asked people to use the hashtag #OpIran or #MahsaAmini to help spread the message and support Iran. One small piece of hair is all it took for Mahsa Amini to be murdered by Iranian morality police. That is one small piece that I take for granted every day as an Iranian girl born in America. The theocracy of Iran has executed an intensepower playwithin its own government, and between the government and the people. Since theIslamic Revolution of 1979, Iranian citizens have been stripped of many of their human rights that we in the Western world never think twice about. Our school dress codes that forbid girls from wearing short shorts? In Iran, women are forced to cover their hair and their bodies with clothing completely. That is just one of the manydiscriminatory lawsIranian women face. They cannot travel, let alone obtain a passport, without their husband’s permission. When a woman is divorced and gets remarried, she must forfeit child custody. Themurder of Aminioccurred on Sept. 16, several days after she was beaten in Tehran by the police force and induced into a coma for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. Her killing was shrugged off by the morality police as, “sudden heart failure,” and as, “unfortunate.” To the rest of the world, she is now a heroine and she has, under unfortunate circumstances, given Iranian women a platform they have lacked since therevolution. First, Iranian citizens brazenlytook to the streets, protesting the immoral actions of the morality police, even burning their headscarves to show that they are not afraid. I am proud to see individuals banding together all across the world in solidarity with the women of Iran, whether they are Persian or not. Many are spontaneouslycutting their hairand gathering forrallies, whilecelebrities are raising awarenesson social media and in person. I rarely heard about Iranian tragedies — or news, period — through the media as I was growing up. Sure, my parents kept me informed about the next innocent person to be thrown in prison, but that was because they had the foreign news sources on hand. They were also directly connected to those tragedies as immigrants. At the start of the revolution, my mother fled Iran without her parents at the age of 13, while my dad escaped in 1984 as a 23-year-old. They both left to avoid religious persecution and to be free from the brutality of the Iranian government, and I am beyond fortunate that they did. As I sit here reading about the resilient women and supporters of Iran, I am more moved by my family’s country than ever. Looking at the faces that risked so much in striving for equality makes me emotional. There is an indelible feeling in me as I see the valiance of the Iranian women inspire all sorts of people to fight for Iran’s freedom. RELATED:OPINION: Students should not stand for white supremacy After all this fighting and death, I certainly do not want to see much of the Western world return to being indifferent towards Iran like I feel it has been before. Amini is sadly not the last martyr that the country will see.Nika Shakarami, a 16-year-old, avidly protested against Iranian theocratic officials following Amini’s murder, but went missing for 10 days after a protest on Sept. 20. The last message on her phone stated that she was being chased by security forces and, sure enough, her body was eventually found in a village 25 miles away from her home town. The innocent citizens of Iran deserve justice, so I urge my peers to avoid negligence. Remember the names Mahsa Amini (Mah-saw Ah-mee-nee and Nika Shakarami (Nee-kaw Shaw-kaw-raw-mee , and thenames of many morewho have died in their brave attempts. I would also like to thank the women and men who have supported Iran since this tragedy. Let this tragedy blossom into an opportunity for the Iranian people to get their freedom back — to allow Iranian-Americans like myself to experience our country of origin with ease and to see our aunts and grandmas feel content once again.

crimson_2022_102,"It is disconcerting to know the objects of conspiracy theories personally. As Harvard students, we learn from some of the same experts who participate in the hoax of climate change and researchers who work on microchipped vaccines. When we talk to them during office hours or sit in their lectures, we find it remarkable that such good-natured people are apparently part of various malevolent cabals! But while it’s fun to make fun of such conspiracy theorizing, it’s important not to dismiss a crisis of confidence that runs deeper. Faith in academia has dropped below 50 percent among American adults. Such widespread doubt can’t be blamed solely on irresponsible anti-intellectuals and conspiratorial grifters. There is a genuinely difficult, central question about how to deal with experts — when should we listen to them? The answer: quite a bit less than they might like. The pandemic has heightened the stakes of figuring out when to defer to experts. Predicting how the virus will spread in certain circumstances, or the risk and efficacy of certain vaccines, requires extremely technical judgment. There are professional biologists and epidemiologists who are trained to answer exactly these types of questions. The argument for deferring to the pros is strongest on questions like these, and I wish more Americans would. But the power of putting an issue beyond normal political wrangling and into “just believe the science” territory is incredibly alluring. Once you decide that lockdowns, or school closures, or travel bans are the right response to the pandemic, it’s tempting to shield them under the protective umbrella of “the science” — even though no amount of scientific expertise can resolve the moral and political tradeoffs of these policies. Science can sometimes tell us that X is likely to result from Y. When we choose to do Y, though, we are always making a moral judgment beyond the scope of expertise alone. More than 1,200 epidemiologists made this mistake when they temporarily broke from their standard social distancing advice to defend protests for racial justice as “vital to … public health.” They may well have been correct. But the howls of hypocrisy went up nonetheless, and not unreasonably: an epidemiologist is not a philosopher or political scientist. To be sure, epidemiologists have professional insight into the public health costs of systemic racism. Like anyone else, they should have strong personal political convictions and act on them. But making prescriptive political statements in their professional capacity suggests an inability to differentiate topics where they have expertise from those where they don’t. There is, in theory, a scientific answer to “how safe was it to protest in early 2020?” There cannot be a scientific answer to “should we have done so?” Given the leftward tilt of academia, reigning in the technocracy may feel uncomfortably like giving ground to the right. It’s not. What is civilian control of the military if not the restriction of experts’ authority — this time hawkish generals instead of liberal scientists — to their area of expertise? The principle in question is not partisan. I don’t want to suggest that the solution is for experts to “stay in their lanes,” terrified of epistemic trespass. One of the best Covid-19 predictive models was created by adata scientistin his twenties with “zero background in infectious-disease modeling.” Experts should be challenged and lanes merged into, allowing for disciplines to build on each other. Professionals should just be honest with themselves about how far their expertise extends. By all means opine on other areas, too, but make arguments that stand on their own; don’t expect us to defer to your authority outside its domain. This is the correct approach because it’s more likely to lead to truth in the long run. But as we’re starting to find out, it’s also the approach in the narrow self-interest of the academy. The more you try to sneak under the hood of “believe the science,” the less people will trust you. Expecting the public to accept any controversial and impactful proposition on faith is a truly incredible ask. Requesting this with any frequency, or with ultimately less-than-relevant expertise, has done and will do serious harm to the influence of experts. Harvard is the training ground for a great deal of expertise. It also aspires, I would hope, to train good laymen: citizens who are thoughtful in how they engage with expertise they can’t replicate. By adopting a more principled approach, we as students can do our part to build back Americans’ trust in experts. We can contribute, in some small way, to the cause of giving our divided country a shared set of facts. Aurash Z.

thetech_mit_2022_22,"When academic departments give a platform and MIT funding to any speaker, the aegis of free speech does not relieve the department from the consequences of that speech. If a sponsoring department invites and funds a speaker who espouses hate, then, while it may not be their intent, the funder has de facto endorsed that hatred. Clearly, hate speech should not be given by any MIT department’s imprimatur. On Oct. 22, MIT Women’s and Gender Studies, Anthropology, the Center for International Studies, and the MIT Libraries sponsored a visit to campus by Mohammed El-Kurd, a speaker who has tweeted glorifications of and promoted violence against Israelis and anyone who supports the State of Israel. During El-Kurd’s talk, he asked MIT students in the audience to create a database of former Israeli soldiers who are the founders of companies in order to, in effect, doxx them. Given that every Israeli is required by law to complete mandatory army service, this request puts a target on nearly every Israeli citizen, including members of our own MIT community. Free speech is a fundamental value of our American society and a necessary right for growth and the exploration of ideas, and robust dialogue about all difficult issues, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, should be encouraged. The only way to engage in the issues that matter is through honest discussion, especially at a place like MIT, where some of the world’s brightest and most thoughtful people try to solve global problems. At the same time, the responsibility inherent in robust free speech is that all people must listen carefully to what is being said and take seriously the threat of legally protected speech that is morally and ethically wrong. At a time when antisemitic attacks are on the rise on campuses across the country, we must call out speakers who utilize discriminatory speech. Hateful language, language that provokes violence, and language that targets individuals or groups because of who they are must be noticed and not overlooked. For our society to continue to thrive, and for the MIT community to continue to be a safe place for minority students to live and learn, hate speech must be named and condemned. Every department who sponsored the Oct. 22 lecture had an ethical responsibility to vet the speaker they helped bring to campus and to hold themselves accountable for the ideas they helped fund. If the MIT community were to act on the recommendations El-Kurd made while speaking here, students on our campus would be endangered because of their national or religious identities. It would be a stain on our institute if our administration continues to fall back on the false assumption that a commitment to free speech is a commitment to unchecked speech. Refusing to acknowledge this distinction threatens our community’s safety and well-being. I invite all members of the MIT community entrusted with leadership positions and the allocation of funds to take steps to protect our campus from hostility directed toward any minority community. Together, we can ensure that MIT remains a place where students of all backgrounds and perspectives can flourish without fear. Rabbi Michelle Fisher SM ’97 is the Executive Director of MIT Hillel."
rice_thresher_2022_54,"Photo courtesy Crystal C. Unegbu ByThresher Editorial Board2/22/22 11:35pm Based on her abundance of concrete ideas and willingness to learn about the SA, we, the Thresher Editorial Board, believe Crystal Unegbu to be the better candidate for Student Association internal vice president. Unegbu has many tangible ideas for how to improve Standing Committees and the New Student Representative program, the main responsibilities of the internal vice president. While both candidates want to increase NSR involvement within their home colleges, Trisha Gupta’s main focus was to advocate for proving some voting capacity in the position. Unegbu also supported this change to an extent, but she had many more ideas for improving the capacity of the role. Namely, Unegbu wants to get NSRs more involved with their residential college governments with stronger mentorship from college presidents and senators, be more involved in senate debriefs and provide more support from committees for the NSRs as they navigate the role. One of the biggest issues with the SA that persists each election season is low engagement with the student body. While Gupta had a few ideas on how to further utilize existing channels for engagement such as social media and listservs, Unegbu took on a critical view of the issue and emphasized the need to plan more events where students can learn about SA committees, have one-on-one conversations with senators from across campus and encourage general student attendance in retreats. That being said, we are wary of Unegbu’s limited experience not just with the SA but the campus in general, being only a freshman. Having been on campus for barely six months, we believe that more time in the SA could benefit Unegbu in achieving her platform. It is important that the IVP understands the issues that concern all of the campus, and Unegbu has mostly had exposure to the concerns of new students through her position as Hanszen College NSR. Although Gupta has more years of experience in the SA, currently serving as chief of staff, her ideas were not as thought out and novel as Unegbu’s. There is much that could be changed within the SA, and we believe that Unegbu is most poised to recognize these issues and seek out innovative solutions to persisting problems.

wildcat_arizona_2022_81,"Digital illustration of alien listening to music in headphones. I have seen that usually, when artists release many albums, their quality goes downhill, but it is not the case for Beach House. Their eighth album,Once Twice Melody,shows how much they have grown in just under 20 years. There is so much growth with sound and lyrics as they release awe-inspiring albums that have transformed the indie-pop genre. This album has four chapters released about a month apart since Nov. 10; the entire album was released on Feb.18. Chapter one is called “Pink Funeral,” chapter two is called “New Romance”and was released on Dec. 8, chapter three is called “Masquerade” and was released on Jan. 19 and the final chapter is “Modern Love Stories”which was released on Feb. 18. The 18-song album is a hit across the board, receiving an 84% via Metacritic and a 9.3 rating thanks to their user reviews. Once Twice Melody, spanning 84 minutes, is a dreamy pop/indie album and a new sound for the group. The melodies are stunning, and the songs are whimsical and soothing. The combination of the vocals and the instruments is hard to beat. According to theirSpotify, Beach House comprises Victoria Legrand, lead vocalist and keyboardist, and Alex Scally, backup vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist. The duo started in Baltimore, Maryland, in 2004 and wrote all of their songs together. From listening to it repeatedly, the album uses a variety of instruments like acoustic guitar, a string ensemble and a drum machine. The use of the string ensemble is brand new for the band, and it is used beautifully. Each song blends into the next and the lyrics are beautifully written. The drum portions of the songs were arranged by James Barone, who also worked with the band for their 2018 album,7,and the strings were arranged by David Campbell according tobeachhouse.bandcamp.com. This album is excellent; however, the songs are lengthy, with the shortest at 3 minutes and 41 seconds and the longest at 7 minutes and 11 seconds. Beach House usually writes more lengthy songs, with their longest music spanning just over 15 minutes. Dan Kopf, a data editor forQuartz, found in 2019 the songs on the radio are generally not longer than 5 minutes. So this album is a definite change from what radio listeners are used to. The album is the first that the duo has produced entirely on their own. According tobeachhouse.bandcamp.com, the songs in the album were primarily written between 2018 and the summer of 2021. However, some of the songs were written over 10 years and most of the songs were recorded at Apple Orchard Studio in Baltimore. Listeners can put the album on, sit back and dissolve into the dreaminess of the album. The way each song connects to the last and the chapters overlap to have a beautiful story that captures the album’s overall theme, which is the highs and lows of being in love. The album is about overcoming a heartbreak and each song is a different emotional experience that goes with heartbreak. The last song, “Modern Love Stories,” is about how universal heartbreak is. Though the album blends exceptionally well, the songs started to sound the same by the end of the album. Yes, they were beautiful, but not very distinguishable from each other. The band is currently on a tour that spans nine countries and includes around 50 shows. The tour kicked off on Feb. 18 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, concluding July 24 in Washington D.C., according toRollingStone.

crimson_2022_50,"Some tell us to keep politics out of the World Cup. Others tell us to keep the World Cup out of politics. Whether we like it or not, politics and the World Cup are inextricably intertwined. The Iran vs. United States match was not like any other game — it was more than that. And I am not saying this because the match represents my Iranian-American identity. It is because the Iran team had more at stake than just advancing to win the World Cup. Their livelihoods were on the line. The last time Iran and the U.S. played against each other was in1998in France. I was not even born yet. Throughout the last 24 years, a lot has changed geopolitically, but when it comes to Iran and the U.S., not much has — until recently. A revolution is happening in Iran. The Iran team was playing with the backdrop of over450 killed and 18,000 arrestedin Iran since mid-September. As the Iranian diaspora grappled with whether or not to support the team, one thing remained true: Iran in the World Cup was another opportunity to amplify, from the stadiums of Qatar, the atrocities happening on the other side of the Persian Gulf. Playing against the U.S. was an opportunity for the revolution to reach a large crowd who might be avid sports watchers, but not avid news readers. I came to the game somewhat indifferent about the outcome. But a few minutes in, it dawned on me that the Iranian team is not only an underdog in this game, but in real life. Under threat ofcrackdownsby the regime, their resistance on the field is a microcosm of what all of Iran is experiencing right now. If you did not watch the game in this context, you missed a lot. Afternot singingthe national anthem during the first round of games, it was allegedlyreportedthat if the players did not behave, their families would face “violence and torture.” In their last two games, they reluctantly sang the national anthem with forlorn faces and refrained from any acts of resistance — seemingly out of fear of retribution. Meanwhile, they played knowing that their fans who did any small act to support the revolution were beingconfrontedand, in some alleged cases, arrested by the Qatari police for their political displays. Their experiences at the World Cup do not remain in Qatar; by way of the Qatari government, the Islamic Republic’s Basij General may have received these names and may make it difficult for these dissenters to return to Iran, as indicated in arecent leaked audio recording. How can a team focus on playing when the real match is against the regime and its human rights violations? How can fans safely use the World Cup to draw light to the revolution knowing that Qatar is not a safe haven from this oppressive regime? I recognize that the Iranian diaspora is fragmented on the World Cup and other things. I understand that many in the diaspora felt Iran’s presence at the World Cup was a distraction from the movement on the ground. Many Iranian Americans were not enthusiastically supporting the national team as they typically do because of the regime’s “sportswashing” aiming to act as a camouflage of its human rights violations. Iran won in my eyes not because I am a sore loser — as I said, I was somewhat indifferent. To me, they won because the Iran team continued to persevere amidst these unprecedented circumstances. They are yet another example of victims of this brutal regime. Many other teams will go home and train for 2026, but the players of Iran have gone home to an ongoing national movement pushing for civil rights for all and an end to the Islamic Republic. They have returned to a nation that has been on strike forthree days. A nation where unlawfully detained protestors continue to facerape, torture, and executions. And a nation where the “morality police” and the ruthless terror of the regime continue, despite mainstream media attempting to prematurely confirm otherwise. It is paramount that we recognize the people of Iran’s fight is not over. Although Iran is no longer in the World Cup, this match served as a reminder that we must dedicate the same energy we have given to this global sporting event to Iran’s historic liberation movement. We must keep our eyes on Iran as they fight for “women, life, freedom.” Ciara S. Moezidis is a second-year Master’s student in Theological Studies at the Harvard Divinity School."
stanforddaily_2022_94,"David Palumbo-Liu is the Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor and Professor of Comparative Literature at Stanford. My life seems bracketed by international crises. I was a child at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the United States confronted the USSR regarding the nuclear missiles it had placed in Cuba, a mere 90 miles from the border of the United States. And now we find another possible threat of nuclear war, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Later I found out that the Cuban Missile Crisis was more complicated than I was taught. I was surprised to find out that the USSR was placing missiles in Cuba to no small degree because the United States alreadyinstalled missilesin Turkey, aimed at Russia. Make no mistake, I thoroughly condemn Russia’s blatantly illegal actions in Ukraine. In the same spirit, I condemn the act of any global hegemon that sacrifices the people of other states for its ambitions — such acts tend to mask expansionism and colonization as “security measures” or “reclaiming rightful territories.” I am speaking of Russia, China and the United States. China’s oppression of the people of Tibet and the Uyghur stand as examples; the U.S.-backed coups and other forms of intervention in Latin America (for instance, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras as others. As much as one should praise the courage displayed by Volodymyr Zelensky, captured in the photo of him wearing a flak jacket and wielding an automatic weapon to hold off Russian invaders, one should also praise the courage of Salvadore Allende, democratically elected president of Chile. In the last photograph of him alive, he is wearing a helmet and holding a machine gun, fighting against a CIA-sponsored coup in his country, one that put in place one of the most notorious dictatorships in history. To quote from Amnesty International’sreport: “The 11 September 1973 Chilean military coup, which overthrew the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende, heralded the implementation of a policy of systematic and widespread human rights violations under the government headed by General Augusto Pinochet. Thousands were detained without charge or trial, tortured, extrajudicially executed, ‘disappeared,’ abducted or persecuted on political grounds.” What about democracy? What commonly occurs with such acts of expansion and intervention is that even if there are authentic, popular grass-roots movements for democracy, they often are co-opted by ambitious politicians who come to place their loyalty to their people second to their willingness to listen to foreign leaders in Washington, Beijing or Moscow. The situation is ripe for massive corruption, violent suppression of dissent and the transformation of states into proxies for the “great powers,” which battle each other on the borders or within these states. And it isn’t simply about individual states. During the Vietnam War — another crisis which I lived through as a high-school student and then as a college student — the war was presented by means of “the Domino Theory,” which held that if one state in Southeast Asia “fell” to Communism, the rest would follow suit. This caused immense destruction not only in Vietnam, but also Laos, Cambodia and elsewhere. What we saw in Vietnam was a civil war transformed into a battle between the United States and Communism; part of what we see in Ukraine involves a conflict between western regions which lean toward the United States and the European Union, and the eastern region that aligns with Russia. It is important to see these interlocking interests as we try to form opinions. Public opinions have public effects. During the Vietnam era, young American men like myself, raised to value democracy, were asked to fight in Vietnam for an illegal war, unsanctioned by Congress (save for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which still did not declare a war . The U.S. had overthrown a democratically elected leader and backed a pro-U.S. leader, not out of regard for the Vietnamese, but for its own ambitions to stop Communism. Decades later, Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense during Vietnam and one of the war’s chief architects, admitted he had “erred.” The New York Timesnoted, “Surely he must in every quiet and prosperous moment hear the ceaseless whispers of those poor boys in the infantry, dying in the tall grass, platoon by platoon, for no purpose. … What he took from them cannot be repaid by prime-time apology and stale tears, three decades late.” It is terrible and horrific to see Ukrainians — both in the military and also civilians — having their lives destroyed. It’s also important to remember that Russia has mandatory military duty, and many Russian soldiers are very young men who are there through no desire of their own — think of the Russian father who asks why it is his son being killed, but not the Russian oligarchs who want this invasion. Ultimately, it is time to think of people — not regimes, alliances or the expansion of power for the already powerful, at deadly cost to everyone else. What about ordinary people? There is an expression: “When the elephants wrestle, it is the grass that is trampled.” I would add, “The grass allows this to continue because the elephants have convinced the grass that this is good for it.” So it concerns me when I see people rallying to the defense of Ukrainewithoutseeing the larger context — that which neither the American nor Russian elephants want us to see. Democracy — true democracy, rather than democracy as an alibi — is endangered when we shift our vision away from the conditions that helped create this crisis. I am writing this opinion piece largely because, as of this writing, none of the experts The Stanford Daily has interviewed for insights into this crisis have mentioned these facts. While we should never take our eyes off Russian aggression, note that its aggression takes place within a more complex history. NATO is referred to numerously in The Daily’s coverage. But it is a military alliance that continues to exist past its time — it was meant as a deterrent to the USSR, creating a federation of allies against that Soviet bloc. The Soviet bloc no longer exists, but NATO continues to. It has sought to expand. From American and British media we know well-enough the Western narrative. But let’s also consider these facts: At the April 2008 Bucharest NATO Summit, NATO announced that Georgia and Ukraine would become NATO states, effectively creating a NATO presence at the very doorstep of Russia. Remember Kennedy’s actions when the USSR moved armaments 90 miles away from Florida? Before 2008, NATO had already incorporated Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in 1999, Romania and the Baltic States in 2004. Russiapublicly drew a red lineat Georgia and Ukraine; NATO did not recognize it. The 2008 announcement about Georgia and Ukraine brought a Russian response: in August 2008, Russia invaded Georgia. In February 2014, there was a political crisis in Ukraine. A pro-Russia president was replaced by a pro-U.S. leader during a popular coup.The USsupportedthiscoup. Seeing this occur, Russia seized Crimea. Crimea is home to many who favor Russia; it also is home to a strategic naval base which Putin did not want to see fall into NATO’s hands. Since then, Russia has fueled the conflicts in Ukraine, supporting pro-Russian fighters and sympathizers in the east. And the U.S. and NATO have rallied to support the Western part of Ukraine. In the fall of 2021, the idea of Ukraine joining NATO was gone, but it had become ade factoNATO state. While Obama had refused to arm the Ukrainians, Trump began selling them arms, which has only intensified under the Biden administration. Turkey has also sold the Ukrainians drones. This all forms part of the bigger picture. It is unclear whether Putin’s actions are in reaction to these specific measures, or if he is simply seizing upon them as a pretext for doing what he has always wanted to do. As of this writing, I am extremely concerned that, given Russia’s unbridled aggression and the U.S.’s and NATO’s refusal to establish a no-fly zone, Ukrainians, feeling the need to protect their country at all cost, may be pushed toward right-wing stances. A view aside from politics Now I am sure some experts will write in and say that I have my facts wrong — that’s fine. Give me yours and source them. I will also be told that, as a humanist and a literary scholar (not a political scientist , I have no business weighing in. I disagree. While political experts have their concerns and methodologies, humanists, and literary scholars in particular, are concerned about the human condition, the ways in which wars and all that lead up to them and lead out of them affect ordinary people who merely want to live and be left alone — or, better yet, live together in ways that extend absolute mutual dignity. War is terrible — I have friends who died in Vietnam, all because of these kinds of machinations by global hegemons who care little about local, ordinary people (no matter what they say , and in fact not only delude them with misinformation and false promises, but enlist them as cheerleaders. If the pandemic and the climate crisis have taught us anything, it is that we are all interdependent. No national boundaries, no alliances, can keep climate change, viruses or nuclear radiation from spreading (Chernobyl taught us that . And let us not forget that wars present a multitude of damages to the environment. It is clear that the current political system is incapable of seriously committing to lasting peace, a safe and sustainable environment, and a healthy planet. The system is devoted to special interests — its own. One way to begin thinking beyond what we have inherited is to consider the power we have together, and to maintain an openness to learning and teaching what we know, and aspiring to discover what we want to know. In that, I am heartened by the anti-war protests in both the west and the east. It is highly doubtful that our so-called leaders are listening."
ubyssey_2022_48,"Nov. 22, 2022 Written byIman Janmohamed Dear Iman, I’ve been in a major slump since school started. My dorm is a mess, I can’t keep track of assignments, I never see my friends and well, I just can’t seem to get out of my slump. How can I become productive again? We’re in the final stretch of the semester and oh boy, is it hard. Homesickness is starting to hit and you’re just starting to realize that the elective you took for an easy A is dragging your average way down. It’s slump city. Slumps happen and it’s good that you’re catching it as it comes on, instead of trying to suppress it. I think the best way to overcome a slump is to recognize you need to rest, and then plan how you’ll tackle your ever-expanding to-do list. I know, it’s no fun, but you’ve gotta do it. So, step one: rest. Sleep, stay hydrated, chill, hangout, take time to slow down. This can be especially hard when school deadlines are piling up, but even a night or two of rest will do you good. Burnout is real and you might feel guilty or lazy for taking a break while everyone else is supposedly grinding it out, but hear me out — people need to take breaks and not everyone is 100 per cent productive 100 per cent of the time. I also like to talk to my friends. They’ll understand where you’re coming from, and seeing that you’re not the only person having an absolute dogshit time makes you feel better. I mean, it makes me feel better at least. Having a bad time while your friends are is solidarity, camaraderie and friendship at its finest. After resting, I write down all my tasks — assignments, articles I’m working on, household tasks that need to be completed, groceries I need to buy — and slowly, I get myself to finish all of them. I like lists because you can see things getting crossed off. It’s motivational that way. And typically, once this list is completely checked off, I feel more comfortable with taking on new tasks, or even relaxing more (which you should be doing anyway! because I’ve tackled all the things I needed to get done. But, besides recognizing you’re in a slump, it’s also important to recognize why you’re there. I might not know everything, I know a few things for sure, like if you’re working yourself to the bone to get that A+, you won’t be able to experience all the “university experience” things people rave about. Yeah, yeah I get it — you’re here for the degree. But having fun and making memories matter, as cheesy as that sounds. It’s also important to know when to go to others for help. Your professors and TAs are there to support you with school and your family and friends are there to support you at home. But, sometimes a slump isn’t just a thing to get over, rather, it’s something to talk to a mental health professional about.

state_press_2022_20,"ASU men’s basketball coach Bobby Hurley expresses his frustrations towards the referees during his team s game against the Portland Pilots at Desert Financial Arena on Tuesday, Nov. 9, 2021. ASU won 76-60. The Sun Devils finished the 2021-22 season with a record of 14-17 and a conference record of 10-10 in Hurley s seventh year as head coach. After years of struggling to find regular season and post-season success under Hurley, it is clear ASU needs to take the next step in rebuilding the men s basketball program: finding a new head coach. ASUstarted the season with a dreadful 2-6 record with five losses in a row. This included the opening Pac-12 game where the Sun Devils were obliterated by Washington State51-29. Hurley s team continued to struggle on the offensive end of the floor throughout the season,finishing 305 of 350 in the country in scoring with 65.4 points per game. Additionally, the consensus among ESPN college basketball analysts was that the Sun Devils should finish fifth in the Pac-12, with one having ASU as high as fourth. But ASU failed to meet expectations, finishing in eighth place. Despite the late surge from ASU, Hurley continued to struggle adjusting to opposing teams defenses. He is barely finding winning seasons, and as other Pac-12 teams have caught up or passed the program Hurley has built, it is unclear why ASU does not move on from Hurley and explore other options for next season s head coach. ASU was up 15 late. You can t write a more perfect ending to the ASU basketball season. What a failure. The four-game win streak gave ASUbasketball fans hope as they entered thePac-12 tournament as the eighth seed ready to face off against ninth-seeded Stanford Cardinals. The game seemed lost once Stanford went up by 15 points with 15 minutes left in the second half.Then the Sun Devils defense forced six turnovers during an 11-0 run to bring the game into reach. With six minutes left in the game, ASU took the lead back thanks to a Jalen Graham hook shot. However, it was a game of runs as Stanford finished the game on a 16-1 run,finishing off the Sun Devils with a buzzer-beater put back to end the season. Fans after the game took to Twitter and were irate with both Hurley and the teams performance. I was mostly uninterested in asu s basketball season but then I noticed the team was hitting its stride to end the season, so I had a little bit of hope heading into march. Honestly? I blame myself. I was so sad, said ASUsophomore business student Abby Bailliere. It was tough to go to the home games and watch ASU struggle, but they turned things around at the end of the season and it gave me hope for the Pac-12 tournament. Once we chocked the lead to Stanford all I could think about was only we could do that and Hurley needs to go. The struggles of the ASU program can not solely be blamed on Hurley, but this has been a theme ever since he became head coach. Ever since he was hired as head coachin 2015, Hurley has had a record of 118-100. In his seven years, the program has only three seasons with anoverall record above .500. In those three winning seasons, Hurley s teams managed to make the March Madness tournament twice as the2019-20 tournament was canceled due to COVID-19. The two seasons ASU made an appearance in March were in2017-18and2018-19. In 2018, ASU lost toSyracusein the first four and managed to bounce back the next year by defeating St. John s in the first four. With very little post-season success, it has been hard for fans to rally around the team. Every basketball game I have gone to this season besides the UCLA upset was horrible to watch. On offense, it seems like we just shoot threes at will and the defense looks lackluster at times, said sophomore business communication student Lincoln Huffman said. There has been a game or two I just did not want to go and watch this team play because it looks like they are not having fun and I know they won t make it past the Pac-12 tournament.

crimson_2022_155,"My time at and before Harvard has been defined by goals. Academic. Athletic. Personal. There is no path to a hyper-selective college like Harvard that does not demand constant self-appraisal. In high school, I routinely assessed how impressive my goals were and how they might measure up to those of other applicants. The ability to become my own admissions officer may have helped me get into Harvard — yet, upon entering Harvard’s gates, this tendency lingers so powerfully that at times I forget to live my life for myself. This is why from now on, I will be driven by only one goal: to feel good. Such a goal might seem trivial, but during my freshman spring, this state of being was not a given for me. After contracting Covid-19 in February, I developed an array of maladies that persisted for months, including loss of concentration, headache, and depression. Even before these symptoms, life at Harvard had often felt overwhelming; perpetually feeling physically unwell only made matters worse. When I recall my most recent semester at Harvard, the harder moments come to mind first: being hopelessly bedridden, drowning in schoolwork, and crying… a lot. If I dig a little deeper, though, other memories begin to surface, much brighter in color and lighter in weight. I rejoice in the new friends I made during the spring and the older friendships that strengthened. I think of the special moments I had with the many people I came to love: eating BerryLine by the river, dancing in the rain on Widener steps,placing secondin an international a cappella competition with the Opportunes. I remember conversations I had with people I knew I could lean on — late nights spent sharing little pieces of ourselves with each other, one fragment at a time. When I allow myself to focus on these memories, the good ones, they come crashing down like waves, their foam concealing darker times hidden beneath the surface. But can we strive to feel good all the time by merely allowing goodness to wash over the negative? In any place, but especially at Harvard, I would say that idea is unrealistic, fraught with traces oftoxic positivity— a mindset characterized by “dismissing negative emotions and responding to distress with false reassurances rather than empathy.” Although appealing in theory, an attitude of toxic positivity avoids deep engagement with emotional struggles, leaving one unable to grapple with difficult emotions that will inevitably turn up again later on. That s the thing about the ocean: as the tides change and currents shift, the depths of the seafloor churn to the surface. Life will stir up your world whether you’re ready for it or not. You can t escape feeling bad sometimes. At Harvard, feeling bad has become endemic. From 2014 to 2018, nearly one in three Harvard undergraduatesreportedthat they have or think they may have depression and anxiety. This was before the coronavirus pandemic triggered a 25 percentincreasein the prevalence of anxiety and depression worldwide and aneven worsemental health crisis on our campus. In such a pressure-filled environment, it can be really hard to feel good. The average Harvard student overworks, undersleeps, and finds themselves hard-pressed to choose between academic excellence and social satisfaction. Desiring to appear “successful,” many act like they have it all together, though few actually do. One part of the problem is our narrative around success, which often focuses on end results rather than the journey to them. When we define success by grades, internships, or awards, we rely too heavily on external metrics for fulfillment, abandoning our internal selves in the pursuit. Our daily experiences become stale and difficult to appreciate: werush walks to class, allow passions to fade into obligations, and let precious time spent with friends become transactional and stressful. Entrapped by a constant need to optimize, we take a backseat in our own lives. We become sick. We feel bad. This semester, I’m redefining success to revolve around feeling good, if only by slowing down just enough to appreciate all the good that is already around me. I want to seek out moments that bring me joy: dancing on the Quad lawn, singing with the Opportunes, and laughing with my friends. I want to sleep a little more, stress a little less, and redirect my thoughts towards gratitude as much as possible. I want to fill my ocean up with as much love and appreciation as I can, while I can. That doesn’t mean ignoring the bad. When life at Harvard inevitably sends the waters churning, bringing tough emotions to the surface, I want to meet them with more self-compassion and give myself more grace. You can’t strive to feel good all the time through focusing on the positive. It would be exhausting to try. But perhaps feeling bad gives us an opportunity to feel good about the way we can care for ourselves — to appreciate our capacity to direct kindness inwards in the same way we project it out. If I could do this consistently, that would be all the success I need. I feel good just thinking about it. Ella J. Deans ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Currier House."
crimson_2022_122,"Harvard Law School just announced that former Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch ’81 will be our Class Day speaker at graduation. The choice is disappointing, but appropriate. I remember the moment I was certain that I needed to go to law school. A week after the 2016 presidential election, despite a heartbreaking loss, Hillary Clinton kept her commitment to speak at the annual gala for the Children’s Defense Fund. Having worked on the campaign and still reeling in disbelief myself, I could not imagine her strength and sense of service to show up that day. In her speech, she remembered her time as a young law student: “I had lots of hopes and expectations about what a law degree would enable me to do.” She spoke of her friend, Children’s Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman, and her early work as a legal activist on behalf of kids. It was a moment of deep inspiration. Three years ago, I, too, entered law school with an idealism about the power of a law degree. But it doesn’t take much time in law school to pull back the curtain. The mythology of America emphasizes great reverence for our legal system, but the law is not always just, fair, or even logical. The law is about systemic, foundational power: who gets to make the rules — and who gets to break them. I’m pleased that the country has become more attuned to this reality as we reckon with police racism, a recent insurrection, and a Supreme Court legitimacy crisis. As I prepare to graduate this May, as one of my favorite TV lawyers, Ellen Parsons, dramatically quips, “I don’t believe in the law anymore, but I do believe in justice.” Still, I’m thankful I went to law school. The law can be a powerful tool — a main lever for change on the path towards justice. More immediately, I’ve gained critical insight into corporate law firms and how they operate. These “Big Law” firms are the glue holding our systems of power together, for better or worse. Based on my exposure to such firms over the course of my law school education, fairly often, it’s for the worse. Much of the litigation work done at major law firms is aimed at protecting the Goliaths from the Davids or shielding corporate bad actors from public accountability. While many of my peers have lofty public service ambitions, most will begin their careers within the Big Law ecosystem. This is in no small part due to what Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein might call a “nudge” from the HLS administration and legal industry more broadly. Career services for non-private firm opportunities are substantially less robust. Moreover, private firms have extensive resources to spend on recruiting students through a highly structured Early Interview Program process, while public interest and non-profit employers have less access. Of course, there are also financial trade-offs. Top law firms offer first-year associates a starting salary of over $200,000. There are a number of public and non-profit legal jobs that offer middle-income salaries or better, but for many, it would require great privilege to be able to turn down a chance at quickly repaying student loans. Still, there is a reason then-Presidential candidate and Harvard alumnus Pete Buttigieg’s time at McKinsey & Company earned great scrutiny. Individual financial rationalizations aside, there is a fundamental tension between a lifelong commitment to public service and a stint making a killing for the prototypical corporate villains — against regular folks. This is how the 83rd Attorney General of the United States Loretta Lynch has spent her post-Obama Administration career. As a partner at a leading Big Law firm, Lynch has taken on a jarring role. With the history-making weight of her honorable service as the first Black woman Attorney General on her shoulders, Lynch has chosen to defend McDonald’s and the NFL against allegations of anti-Black discrimination. Though not uncommon for public sector leaders to return to private practice — her predecessor Eric H. Holder Jr. also returned to Big Law, in addition to championing voting rights efforts — I’ll admit her current trajectory in this charged moment israther uninspiring. As a private citizen, Lynch has every right to make whatever career choices are best for her. However — given her recent career arc — as Harvard Law School’s graduation speaker, Lynch symbolizes the haunting emptiness that plagues much of the legal profession. Kaivan K. Shroff is a fourth-year joint-degree student at the Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Law School."
state_press_2022_57,"Recent events in Arizona s governor s race shine light on how politics is becoming increasingly concerned with entertainment over education. From debate controversy to baseless criticisms of Arizona universities, the electoral drama and local political grandeur are at a peak, taking attention off essential local issues and drawing it to dramatics. The gubernatorial race between Kari Lake and Katie Hobbs is an increasingly hot-button issue in local politics and, now, forArizona PBS. Hobbs has been met with criticism from both Democrats and Republicans with her recent refusal to debate Lake, with some going as far as to call the move political malpractice. Democrats are especially concerned with Hobbs refusal to debate Lake, as this can make her appear weaker, especially compared to her flashy opponent. Hobbs campaign strategy is much more relaxed, which may lead her platform to be overlooked as her main media presence is based on controversy. READ MORE:Inside Students for Kari Lake Despite her refusal to debate Lake, Hobbs was granted a one-on-one interview with PBS, leading to the cancellation of Lake s interview with the station by the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Commission. PBS sinterviewwith Hobbs continued as scheduled on Oct. 18, while Lakeinterviewedwith AZTV on Oct. 23. READ MORE:Kari Lake s Arizona PBS interview canceled after station scheduled Katie Hobbs interview Hobbs claims she will not debate Lake because her opponent is not interested in having a substantive discussion about Arizona issues, and is more concerned with making a spectacle than anything else. Of course, Lake has been using the controversy as ammunition against Hobbs, calling her cowardly for being too scared to debate. Lake herself has three decades of on-screen experience as a journalist and news anchor, which has proved to be useful experience for the campaign she is leading. Hobbs isn t the only one receiving slander from Lake after the PBS controversy. Lake also slammed ASU for turning into a liberal campus due to wokeism. She claims that we have to root (it out in order to protect free speech. Contrary to Lake s claims, a variety of members of the ASU community recently criticized ASU s free speech policy for being too lenient when ASU s Conservative Republicans United hosted known white supremacist Jared Taylor on campus this September. Many student groups advocated for the University to cancel the event and stand by its charter, which states ASU is measured not by whom it excludes, but by whom it includes, for the safety of its students. READ MORE:Opinion: Amid Jared Taylor event, ASU continues to platform bigotry Lake s claims that ASU s wokeism and liberalism inhibit free speech seem to be baseless, at least in regard to the PBS controversy. Editor associate at Arizona PBS, Jamar Younger, detailed how Lake was offered an interview with Arizona PBS but declined the invitation. While KAET certainly appreciates the value of tradition, KAET also has a responsibility to deliver news and information to the people of Arizona as well as responsibilities as a broadcaster with a license issued by the Federal Communications Commission, Younger said. The invitations issued to both major party candidates for Arizona governor were issued in light of those responsibilities. Instead of being concerned about both candidates sharing their platforms, Lake is more concerned with conspiracy theories about the woke mob and with creating a spectacle of herself in the media. The dramatics of debate dissent and public slander display how ostentatious politics even at the local level has become. At this point, it seems the concern is no longer educating people on the particular platforms of candidates, but rather creating political splendor to keep people entertained. Instead of focusing on name-calling and baseless accusations, Arizona voters need to look past the theatrics and focus on candidates stances on local issues to decide which candidate will best serve the community.

wildcat_arizona_2022_0,"Mental health plays a big role in our overall health and well being. Yet, there is still a stigma behind it. Conversations about mental health are something that many individuals have tried to avoid. However, in recent years it has become more and more common for individuals to open up about mental health. Through social media there have been countless posts shared with resources, personal stories and motivational posts to show support. The content that has been shared is helping to normalize the discussion of mental health and mental illness and break the stigma behind it. Social media isn’t all that bad. Like everything in life, there are pros and cons. However, social media has given individuals a platform to open up and share their stories and experiences and this has become increasingly more common. With about4.62 billion social mediausers, the posts we share have the possibility of reaching more people than we could imagine. The hashtag#mentalhealthon Instagram has over 36,000,000 posts. Under the hashtag, there are posts of important reminders, resources, inspiration and personal experiences of others. On social media, many individuals repost and share the inspirational messages and resources on their stories and feeds for people in their own life to see. On TikTok, the hashtag#mentalhealthhas 35.3 billion views and #mentalhealthmatters has 17.5 billion views. Many videos under these hashtags are short, uplifting TikToks, personal stories and resources available to help. We never know who is struggling and who the posts might help.The National Alliance of Mentalhealth reports that 21% of adults in the U.S. are affected by mental illness. Simply reposting a list of mental health resources or sharing that you are someone who cares can have a positive impact on the people around us. It’s important to show support and understanding to those who might be struggling. Many social media users have been flooding the platforms with helpful and informative posts. By doing this they are opening up conversations and helping to make social media a more positive and safe space. These safe spaces on social media can help users find resources and feel less alone with what they are going through. A study done bythe Journal of Education and Health Promotionstudied campaigns and posts on various social media platforms to find if social media is an effective tool for increasing mental health awareness. Their conclusion stated, “Using social media platforms to conduct mental health campaigns is an effective initiative as one can reach out to many people over a short time frame. With the help of technology, participants could virtually be a part of the campaign easily. There is an increasing trend in mental health awareness by effectively using digital media as an information dissemination platform.” The more open we are the more we talk about how we are doing mentally, the more others will feel less alone.

wildcat_arizona_2022_19,"Tucson has a lot of places you can see a movie, specifically a lot for a city its size. Tucson isn’t known for being a big city. As much as it’s sizable, we know Phoenix is bigger, and Tucsonans seem to be happy being a “smaller city.” However, it stands out to me that Tucson has so many movie theaters. In total, Tucson has about twelve places you can regularly see a movie, some of them fairly close to each other. Each movie theater in town serves a different purpose, but which one is the best one for you to see a movie? In this list, you can see just where the best places are and why! 12.AMC Foothills AMC Foothills serves the Foothills community and other northern neighborhoods. It also housesTucson’s only IMAX theater, which makes it a worthy place to see a blockbuster. So why is it at the bottom of this list? AMC Foothills is in Foothills Mall, a mall that is almost entirely closed at this point. It has a couple of smaller stores and a Barnes and Noble, but most of its storefronts are empty, and it feels different to walk through from the other malls. Whereas Park Mall and Tucson Mall are still vibrant shopping centers, Foothills Mall feels creepy; to walk through Foothills Mall is to walk through a mall’s ghost. It’s not a pleasant feeling, and that stops seeing a movie there from being a pleasant experience. The auditoriums are clean, and the concession stand is vibrant, with a full bar and plenty of hot food options. But the locale of Foothills Mall just stops AMC Foothills from being recommendable. 11.Century 20 El Con When you go into a typical Cinemark theater, you expect the comforts of a large chain, most notably the reclining seats that have become commonplace at other Cinemark locations, but also a big, open lobby and easily accessible ticker machines. Century 20 El Con doesn’t have those things. It’s a bare-bones way to see a movie. However, my ranking of El Con at number eleven also shows the subjectivity and biases present in this list. I have close friends who love El Con. They love it not just for the location, convenient to Central Tucson, but also for thenostalgia factor. It was my parents’ movie theater when they were in college, and I believe that’s true for a lot of people in Tucson in their age range. While El Con has something to offer for those reasons, I don’t believe it’s recommendable in general because it’s the same price as other nicer, newer theaters, so it just won’t give you a bang for your buck. 10.Harkins Tucson Harkins has two locations here in town, but they’re incredibly similar, so I’ve decided to group them together. Harkins is a nice experience. It’s also a distinctlyArizona experience. It’s a chain that originated in Arizona with primarily Arizona locations; that has novelty in and of itself. Harkins also has a wonderful lobby with bright lights and bold, welcoming colors to make a movie feel like an event. So if I only have positive things to say about Harkins Tucson, why does it rank so low? There’s not much special about it to differentiate it from other mainstream theaters, and it’s hard to recommend it just based on pleasantly average. 9.Century Tucson Marketplace When Century Tucson Marketplaceopened up, it was a big deal — partially because it serves an area in the east of Tucson that needs a movie theater but didn’t have one, and partially because it was said to be fancy. It was billed as a “NextGen” theater, and, at the time, that language was apt. Seeing “Get Out” at Marketplace was the first time I got to see a movie with reclining seats. Now that those are fairly commonplace, I don’t know that Marketplace is a good theater to recommend to Tucson at large because it doesn’t offer much more than reclining seats, but I love that it exists for the community who needs it in that area. 8.Fox Tucson Theatre The Fox is an incredibly old theater, and stepping into it is like stepping intothe thirties. That’s exactly what makes the Fox so cool; its antique elements, like a restored organ, add to the mystique, making you feel like you’ve stepped back in time. I spoke with Bonnie Schock, one of the people who runs the Fox, as well as one of its volunteers, and what came through the most was the passion people have for the venue. This historic location has so many people working to keep it running, and that is beautiful. Schock spoke about the theater’s aesthetic electrically, “The reality of attending an event here all feels good and all feels right. People have so many connections to this space, even when it’s their first time. It’s such a gorgeous piece of architecture — the kind of thing you don’t have the opportunity to experience anymore when you go out.” Volunteer Steve Peterson told me he loved keeping the Fox alive. He talked about how much he loved that building, and his passion for the Fox rubbed off on me immediately. When asked about why people still come to the Fox, Peterson said, “Because I would put it in the top five theaters in the world!” I immediately wanted to just step inside and watch a movie. Even though I’ve been to the Fox many times, I wanted to relive how that theater can affect someone as much as it has Peterson. The Fox doesn’t show movies as much as most of the other places on this list. It’s primarily a concert venue now. However, I highly recommend seeing a movie there and feeling this core part of Downtown Tucson right in front of you. In fact, it seemed to me that the Fox had been showing more movies lately than it used to, but Schock swiftly corrected me on that point; she said they’ve been showing movies for a while; people are just more aware of it. Shock said, “We are strategically programming. And the bulk of them usually also involve some type of live event.” Recently, the Fox screened the silent classic “Phantom of the Opera” with live accompaniment. “It’s a totally unique experience for a silent film. You get to experience what it was like almost a hundred years ago,” Schock said. RELATED:REVIEW: ‘Dance Theatre of Harlem’ in Centennial Hall 7.Casa Video and Film Bar Casa is one of the two places on this list that is cheating. It’s not technically a movie theater, but it’s a very fun place to see a movie. Casa is a video rental store. If you’re my age, there’s a good chance you’ve never been inside a video rental store. But Casa is still up and running with food trucks, free popcorn for customers and a fully functioning bar. When most bars show movies, people aren’t there for the movie — they’re there to talk. But Casa combines a bar atmosphere with a cinematic one, and the two blend quite well, making this one of the more unique destinations on this list. 6.Roadhouse Cinemas Despite expanding into other cities, Roadhouse is a home-grown Tucson original, and it has a distinctly Tucson vibe. Roadhouse’s manager Faith Oliver told me that’s becauseits creators value Tucson greatly. “We have two owners, both local gentlemen who graduated from the U of A. They are here; they are Tucson. Their love is actually of Tucson and of this business. We’ve just expanded it,” Oliver said. Roadhouse is also Tucson’s first dine-in theater. It’s simultaneously a movie theater and restaurant; if you want to, you can even go there and just eat with no movie. The food is very good! They also have great wine and dessert. The real star of Roadhouse is the popcorn. Every theater advertises its popcorn as the best, but I genuinely believe that Roadhouse’s is the best. It has great flavor with multiple options. That combination of things makes Roadhouse a great Tucson locale. Stay tuned for part two of the top five places to see a movie in Tucson!

crimson_2022_27,"Tower of London. The Year of Our Lord, Two Thousand Fourteen. A fairly robust little Indian boy is sitting on a battlement, eyeing a murder of crows descend on a fish and chips cart, planning one of the greatest heists in history. Of course, it wasn’t successful. If it had been, the aforementioned well-fortified Indian child — me — would be writing this op-ed from inside jail, eating the King’s prison porridge. “Those bloody British.” A key phrase, hard-coded into any good Desi’s frontal lobe. And for good reason — the Brits looted, conquered, and subjugated India for over 300 years. By the time they left, they had laid the foundation for what quickly became one of the world’s most dangerous, violent rivalries. But put an Indian and a Pakistani in one room, and they will agree on one thing: F--- those bloody British. So when my parents and I were staring at one of the largest diamonds in the world, the Kohinoor, studded safely in the Crown of the Queen Mother, I was not told about its history, its curse, its veneer, or its honor. I was told one thing. “They stole that from us, you know?” After the recent death of Queen Elizabeth II, there has been a groundswell of online support in India for returning the diamond, even landing #Kohinoor on the trending topics list on Indian Twitter. The diamond is purported to have first been unearthed in the mines of Kollur in present-day Andhra Pradesh, after which it was passed from kingdom to kingdom, from the Delhi Sultanate to the Mughals, until it finally ended up in the hands of the Singh Maharajas of the Sikh Empire. It was Maharaja Duleep Singh Bahadur that finally handed over the Kohinoor to Queen Victoria, though he had little choice in the matter: The diamond was a cherry on the top of the 1849 Treaty of Lahore, which ended the Second Anglo-Sikh War and annexed Punjab to British Company rule. The diamond was carted from British India to London, where it was extolled by the Marquess of Dalhousie, the man who had secured its provision by treaty. The British population, though, were rather unimpressed by the lumpy gem — this was not the “Mountain of Light” that had been advertised to them. So Prince Albert cut the diamond in half just to shine it. There’s a peculiar sort of parallel in that. Just like the Kohinoor was cut in half, colonial India was cleaved into the modern state of India and Pakistan — two nations and more than a billion people birthed into nearly a century of conflict. In many ways, Britain’s refusal to repatriate the Kohinoor feels like a hard, crystalline symbol of its unwillingness to let the sun set on the British Empire, to let go of the gem of their empire, to acknowledge their role in tearing apart a subcontinent. Repatriation is a hot topic internationally. Former imperialist nations like France and Germany have pledged to return indigenous items taken by conquest, and university museums like Cambridge have promised the same. Across the pond, in our very own Cambridge, Harvard has promised to return human remains housed in our museums, and a further push is being made to investigate how the University acquired these remains and many other such items. And yes, the guidelines are rather vague and left to the University’s discretion, but in general, repatriation seems to be on the rise. In this respect, the United Kingdom stands as a bastion of stiff-upper-lipped, Earl-Grey-flavored resistance. While some repatriations have been granted in the past, the British Museum Act of 1963 outright prohibits the deaccession of any artifact, barring special circumstances. This is not likely to change soon. It seems that the ex-largest empire in the world is loath to acknowledge that its previous colonies have risen in the world stage, preferring to hold on to the policy of “finders keepers, losers weepers.” So, my dear Brits, I now speak directly to you. Hi mates. I hope you’re doing well. First of all, R.I.P. Elizabeth. She may have contributed to colonization and spent decades as imperialism’s kindliest face, but as a person, she was formidable and generally loved. That said, listen, we’re gonna need the diamond back. You lot barely even use it. And yes, this may not necessarily change in an Indian museum, but here’s the difference: For us, it’s a beacon of our cultural heritage, a jewel that represents the journey of a billion people’s ancestors through history, a special representation of the country; for y’all, it’s just another big, ill-gotten diamond. Also, get with the program. Institutions all over the world are returning things to their homelands. You have a rich cultural history of your own to display that spans about 1500 years of everything Game of Thrones is based off of. And, what do you even need the diamond for?

rice_thresher_2022_23,"ByThresher Editorial Board9/13/22 11:04pm Residential college life is often considered the cornerstone of the “Rice experience.” Just look at any Rice admission materials or listen to the chants at Beer Bike. College governments, then, play an integral role in representing and serving the students within their residential colleges. From Brown to Wiess, residential colleges host a plethora of committees, including the standard committees across campus and ones that stand out in their singularity like with Hanszen’s cheese committee. College governments and their committees should, in theory, reflect the priorities of the students they represent. While we are not denying the value of current committees — they play large roles in facilitating connection and tradition within their colleges, something we appreciate — we ask college governments and the campus community they represent to re-examine how they prioritize their time and resources. This can come in a variety of shapes and sizes. For example, some residential colleges have organized committees whose purpose is to facilitate community service outings into the greater Houston area. Students joke about the “Rice bubble,” but these committees aim to pop it by facilitating connections between Rice and the broader Houston community. Colleges can revisit their financial accessibility efforts by subsidizing or covering the cost of merch or certain events with associated fees. While some colleges’ merch come with high price tags, putting more funds towards subsidizing or paying for college merch would make them more accessible for low-income students without the hassle of requesting funding through their college magister funds. Lowering or eliminating funds associated with some events that colleges host would allow more students to participate where they can forge meaningful links to their college. More attention and funds could be given to college-specific affinity groups, cultural and diversity committees. This would allow for more community events and opportunities for connection within affinity groups. Prioritizing promoting cultural events in the colleges or subsidizing tickets to campus-wide cultural events would signal a commitment to supporting the organizers on their college cultural or diversity committees while presenting a way for the college to come together and bond during the events. These are just some of the many ways college committees could consider reallocating their resources. And again, we are not asking colleges to do away with all of their “fun” committees. Rather, we implore governments across campus to take a more holistic view of which committees they promote the most and whom those committees represent. College committees should serve and bring together their college communities — all of their college communities. Let’s see just how unconventionally wise we really are.

stanforddaily_2022_1,"To Members of the Stanford Community: In light of the publicity and discussions surrounding papers published by President Marc Tessier-Lavigne, and as Stanford faculty members who conduct biological and biomedical research, we would like to provide our Stanford community of faculty, staff, and students with our perspective on these issues. Scientific integrity and data reproducibility are paramount to what we do. Nevertheless, errors do occur in science — and when they do, there are several options for making corrections, depending on the severity of the error. Questioning a researcher’s scientific integrity is a very serious allegation that should not be confounded with the detection of errors in a few papers, particularly against a backdrop of work that has beenwidely replicated by others. Indeed, the scientific process is inherently error-correcting as researchers test the validity of published work and construct robust fields based on foundational discoveries. As faculty members and principal investigators in contemporary biological laboratories, we work closely with our graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to ensure the accuracy of our experimental work. However, advancing scientific frontiers increasingly requires larger teams of scientists who bring distinct sets of expertise to a study. In science, as in all realms of life, mistakes are inevitable. We strive to build a culture that aims not to punish mistakes made by trainees or one another, but instead encourages criticism and provides authors the opportunity to correct errors. Our scientific contributions will ultimately be tested by colleagues who examine our discoveries and extend them into new domains. The Stanford Daily has published a series ofarticlesin recent weeks raising concerns about several papers related to President Tessier-Lavigne that contain possibly digitally altered or partially duplicated figures. Among these papers, President Tessier-Lavigne was listed as the corresponding author (also known as the senior author on three (papers published in 1999 and 2001 . We believe that a formal review is appropriate for these three papers. President Tessier-Lavigne has stated (and each journal hasconfirmed that after problems with the figures were spotted many years ago, hecontactedthe journals’ editors to resolve these issues, but that the journals failed to publish the corrections or take further action. In addition,newconcernshave been raised with two of the papers. We feel that it is appropriate to investigate the questioned images and communications with the editors of the journals. We hope that the Board of Trustees and experts in the field will be able to resolve the questions about these papers and identify an appropriate course of action to address any errors. Regarding the other papers, the figures in question were generated in the labs of the senior authors and not in President Tessier-Lavigne’s laboratory. Six of the corresponding authors stated on PubPeer that the data in question were from their own laboratories and have taken responsibility for any errors. The authors of five of the papers have already offered explanations for these errors. Inone, alterations to figures were made by the publisher (who changed the font of the panel labels and not by any of the authors. As scientists, our greatest fear is that we might publish a paper that contains errors. That said, in the case of collaborations between multiple laboratories, and especially for international collaborations, it is not always possible for collaborators to see all the primary data, which might include X-ray films of biochemical gels showing proteins or nucleic acids of different sizes and abundance, sections of tissue visualized and photographed under a microscope, or analyses of the physiological responses or behavior of living cells or animals. In our opinion, it is unfair to question a scientist’s integrity based on images produced from a collaborator’s laboratory. Holding every author to an identical standard of responsibility would require a level of scrutiny of primary data that could stifle scientific collaboration and productivity. In the case of President Tessier-Lavigne,core discoveriesmade by his laboratory have not only stood the test of time after validation by laboratories around the globe, but have also served as a foundation for the field of axon guidance. President Tessier-Lavigne’s discovery of families of axon guidance molecules and their receptors hasrevolutionizedour understanding of how the brain is wired. These accomplishments do not guarantee that every paper he has authored is free of errors, but collectively they demonstrate a high level of scientific rigor and reproducibility. We hope that the investigation of the three articles under question will be balanced, fair, and informed by an understanding of how scientific collaborations are conducted. We also hope that members of our community will not rush to judgment until the review is completed. Sincerely yours (in alphabetical order , Aaron D.

state_press_2022_2,"The GOP is adapting a new strategy leading into November. There s something to be said about beginner s luck. But for Arizona Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters, his luck seems to be running out. And now he s feeling the heat, illuminating a new, iron-fisted side of the Republican Party — a side that s frightening in its pragmatism. Blake Masters, the Republican Senate challenger to Mark Kelly, fits perfectly into the MAGA archetype, evenwinning an endorsement from Trump himself.And yet, in a seemingly uncharacteristic political move, Sen. Mitch McConnellslashed ad fundingfor the candidate right before the crucial Arizona general election in November. What could have possibly been McConnell’s rationale? The answer is complicated, and reflective of the GOP s changing political strategy. In recent years, Arizona has established itself as a battleground state with its usually reliable Republican voting base. Up until recently, the GOP had a strong grasp, according to Marcus Dell’Artino, a long-time political consultant and currently a partner atFirst Strategic. “Six months ago, it’s fair to say that the generic ballot heavily favored Republicans in Arizona, Dell Artino said. It was going to be a mammoth red tidal wave. We were thinking Mark Kelly would be in trouble.” The momentum all changed after the unexpected upheaval of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court. Since then, Dell’Artino notes that nationally Democrats outperformed their historical norms in special elections. This puts Masters, a candidate previously backed by former President Trump and co-founder of PayPal Peter Thiel, in a precarious position. The GOP’s financial priorities shifted from trying to ride the red wave to protecting senators, who would ordinarily be safe, according to Dell Artino. Due to Trump receiving a large amount of fundraising while the rest of the GOP struggles, Masters already had less money to work with. FollowingThiel’s rebuff of Mitch McConnell, he suddenly found himself $8 million short on funding. Worse, Dell’Artino highlights the fact that the money was pulled out of TV ad reservations. Essentially, even if Thiel relents and invests more money into Masters’ campaign, there wouldn’t be enough ad space left on TV to spend the money on. One question remains: Why was Masters the doomed Republican candidate, and not someone else? Kim Fridkin, a foundation professor at ASU’s School of Politics and Global Studies and contributor for several prominent political publications, notes that negative campaigning played a part. “The negative campaigning was a reflection that (Masters isn’t a moderate candidate, that he’s an extreme candidate, Fridkin said. This caused both the negative campaigning and caused the money to be allocated elsewhere. Part of that extremism was Masters’ notoriously puritanical stance on abortion, calling itdemonic and a religious sacrifice,and backing a national ban. Despite his efforts toscrub the stance off his campaign site, it continues to haunt his public image. According to Dell’Artino, women are the “golden goose” of the upcoming election. White women are a sought-after voter demographic for the GOP, consistently voting Republican since 1952, with over 55% voting for Trump in 2020. Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it would have been wise for Blake Masters to soften his abortion stance as to not upset this key voting group. White women have typically enjoyed better access to abortion relative to women of color, but now the overturn of Roe has put that into jeopardy. This changed with the unexpected Supreme Court decision that put their previously granted right in jeopardy. With his reckless anti-abortion remarks, Blake Masters may have sealed his own figurative political coffin, aptly punished for not researching his voter base. Masters situation reveals how ruthlessly tactical the GOP is becoming to save its Senate seats. The GOP is willing to sabotage a popular candidate and abandon ship in a battleground state in order to reach its political objectives. Although McConnell likely made the right call, given he has other candidates to attend to, that doesn t necessarily negate the unflinching and even pitiless way he cut off a once-favorite pawn. This reveals a new side of the Republican Party, one that is cold, pragmatic and vicious in its execution. Instead of focusing on former President Trump s latest antics or yet another Blake Masters-esque political blunder, we need to pull back the curtains and get a glimpse of the true GOP—one that would stop at nothing to win. Even if it means taking out one of its own. Edited by Sadie Buggle, Logan Stanley and Kristen Apolline Castillo. Reach the columnist atmosmonbe@asu.edu.

thetech_mit_2022_55,"​​Dear MIT community, On Feb. 24, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine is my home. My parents and all my relatives are in Ukraine. Many of my friends have become refugees; many others took up arms and are defending the country. In this letter, I want to explain why this war is unjust, why you should care, and what you can do to help Ukraine. This is a war of Russian imperialism. Russian president Vladimir Putin started this war to install a puppet regime in Kyiv and bring my country into Russia’s imperial fold. But Ukrainians do not want this. Ukrainians strive to be a part of the free world — the world of democracy, rule of law, and respect for human rights. Equally as important, Ukrainians do not want to be a part of the “Russian world.” Russia has subjugated Ukraine (as well as Belarus, Georgia, and parts of Central Asia for many centuries. For centuries, Russia tried to erase Ukrainian language and culture and killed our poets and scientists. It went as far as to create an artificial famine — Holodomor of 1932–33 — to exterminate Ukrainians and break them into submission. Putin is part of that disdainful tradition. That is why Ukrainians fight — and fight so fiercely. Ukrainians fight for their freedom, for the right to be Ukrainian, for the right to determine their own future. These aspirations are universal. They are just. If you believe in these rights, if you believe that big countries subjugating smaller ones by force is wrong, you should care about Ukraine. Furthermore, the Russian military — unable to achieve its aims in a fair fight — is committing war crimes. Russia is shelling residential areas, destroying civilian infrastructure, and shooting at the evacuation routes that their own leadership agreed to. Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people just 20 miles from the Russo-Ukrainian border, has been reduced to rubble. Russian forces bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol. Russian forces are using armaments and tactics forbidden by international law. Russian forces shelled the largest nuclear power plant (NPP in Europe — Zaporizhzhia NPP. They control Chornobyl NPP and cut it off from the proper maintenance. These actions risk creating a nuclear catastrophe larger than the one in 1986. For the sake of human compassion and for the sake of the environment, you should care about Ukraine. Okay, you care, but what can you do? The way to end this war is to pressure Putin into good-faith negotiations. This pressure comes from Ukrainian military strength and Russian economic weakness. And YOU can help us ramp up the pressure by: Reaching out to your elected officials.This is the most important thing you can do for Ukraine, and I implore you to do it. If you are a U.S. citizen, please call your representatives, senators, and the White House. Tell them that you support humanitarian, financial, and military aid for Ukraine. Right now, the highest priority for Ukraine is air-defense systems and anti-tank equipment. Tell your officials that doing business with Russia — and thereby sponsoring the war — is unacceptable. I beg of you, Europeans in particular: say no to Russian gas and oil! Donate to the Ukrainian cause.The Ukrainian Cultural Center of New England has published a list of U.S.-based 501(c (3 nonprofit organizations you can support athttps: uccn.org/charities/. If Ukraine stops fighting, there will be no Ukraine. If Russia stops fighting, there will be no war. Ukraine cannot surrender. Please help us survive. Please help us win.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_28,"President Joe Biden issued anexecutive orderto unfreeze $7 billion in funds from Afghanistan’s central bank, which was frozen late last year following the country’s takeover by the Taliban, on Feb. 11. The executive order also allows for the $7 billion to be deposited to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to be split evenly — $3.5 billion each — between humanitarian relief for Afghan people and American victims of 9/11. This decision is both unexpected and horrendous. During a time when Afghanistan is facing one of its worsthumanitarian crises, the U.S. government has the audacity to take money that rightly belongs to Afghanistan and reallocate half of it for U.S. interests, even after all the damage the U.S. caused by engaging in the 20-yearwar in Afghanistan. The U.S. coalition’s departure from the country was almost immediately followed by the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban’s invasion. Therefore, the entire $7 billion should go directly toward humanitarian relief in Afghanistan. Thefundswere left on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York by Afghanistan’s central bank after the Afghan government was overthrown by the Taliban in August 2021. A former U.S. Treasury Department official in Afghanistan described the central bank reserves as a “rainy day fund” for the Afghan people. While it’s unclear who has legal authority to access the account now that the former government has dissolved, the funds, mostly made up of foreign exchange funds and Western aid, had accumulated over the last two decades. Additionally, half a billion dollars in the total fund are also thereservesof commercial banks in Afghanistan, which includes the savings of Afghan citizens who are simultaneously experiencing a collapsing economy, starvation, disease and violence. End Afghan Starvation Founder Naser Shahalemi noted toNPRthat to dismantle a federal reserve in development for 20 years would be detrimental to Afghanistan’s future economy. “Yeah. I mean, the way that they divided this money was absolutely illogical because first we need to decipher who has the right to decide another country’s national assets and federal reserve,” Shahalemi said. Imagine being from any country that’s not the U.S. and watching this situation unfold, as the U.S. government takes hold of foreign assets for the first time ever and solely decides how to distribute it. Any other country would see an imperial superpower, once again, taking advantage of its global position to further exploit the resources and economy of another country. Since the Taliban takeover in August 2021, Afghanistan’s economy has beenrapidly collapsingboth due to the Taliban’seconomic policiesand the halt offoreign aidwhich has made up half of the government’s budget. As the U.S. and its Western allies don’t recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, the country is largely cut off from the international economy, further contributing to their growing humanitarian crisis. “Because of the sanctions, Afghans have been locked away from their own money. And if that happened in America, people would be in outrage,” Shahalemi said toNPR. According to theWorld Food Programme, 22.8 million people, more than half of the country’s population, are now facing food insecurity, and 8.7 million are facing emergency-level food insecurity. With the economy collapsing, the inflation rates on food have made food less accessible. The situation will only worsen from here. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP projects that by mid-2022, 97% of Afghans could fall into poverty. Afghanistan has also been suffering from a measles endemic since 2021. According to theWorld Health Organization, January cases have been at its highest in the past four years with 35,319 measles cases and 156 deaths reported. This does not include the amount of current unreported cases, so these numbers can be expected to continue increasing in coming weeks. Biden’s support of allocating $3.5 billion of the funds to 9/11 victims didn’t just come out of nowhere. After the Taliban takeover,9/11 plaintiffshave been asking for the Afghan funds because they believe the Taliban had a role in supporting the 9/11 attacks. While Sept. 11 was a tragic day for the families and friends of those who lost loved ones in the attack, there is a massive misconception among the general public that the Taliban or the Afghan people have any connection to the attacks. Al Qaeda is the terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks. They are a completely separate group from the Taliban organization. In Craig Whitlock’s 2021 book “The Afghanistan Papers,” Whitlock highlighted how the Bush administration and American media outlets wrongfully merged the two following Sept. 11. “The Taliban protected bin Laden and built a strong alliance with al-Qaeda, but Afghans did not play a role in the 9/11 hijackings and there is no evidence they had advance knowledge of the attacks,” Whitlock wrote. The interchangeability of al-Qaeda and the Taliban to many Americans has been a lasting effect of the U.S. government’s portrayal of the two in the war on terror. Additionally, according to theNational Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, none of the 9/11 hijackers were even Afghans — 12 out of the 13 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and one was from the United Arab Emirates. Adam Weinstein, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute, served as a U.S. marine in Afghanistan and shared with theGuardianhis belief that the Afghan people have been caught in the middle of the U.S. war on terror and the Taliban. “The idea that overnight, the central bank reserves went from belonging to the Afghan people to being the transferable property of the United States is nothing short of colonial,” Weinstein said. With Afghanistan facing a humanitarian crisis in dire need of relief, Biden must reconsider his order to allocate half of the funds from Afghanistan’s central bank to victims of 9/11. The U.S. needs to make the responsible and moral decision to devote all $7 billion to Afghanistan humanitarian relief. Otherwise, the U.S. is once again failing Afghanistan and allowing millions to suffer even further. Erika Cao is an Opinion Staff Writer. She can be reached atcaoea@uci.edu."
thetech_mit_2022_4,"Anybody connected with MIT has likely heard of the “Abbot Affair” by now.Dorian Abbot, a geophysicist from the University of Chicago, was invited to give the prestigiousJohn Carlson Lecture, an annual public event of the MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. Though it is unrelated to his research or lecture topic, Abbot is an outspoken advocate for “Merit, Fairness, and Equality” (MFE , in opposition to the “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” (DEI initiatives that are now the norm on many campuses, including at MIT. Abbot has made many controversial statements in the public square in his defense of MFE. After an uproar both internal to MIT’s campus and on social media about allowing Abbot to speak, the department canceled this year’s Carlson Lecture and invited Abbot to instead give an internal colloquium to the department. Whatever your views are on DEI or MFE and whatever you think of Abbot’s public comments, this cancellation is a clear sign that academic freedom at MIT is in peril. That many find Abbot’s comments in favor of MFE offensive (including some members of theMIT Free Speech Alliance is entirely to the point — protections of academic freedom ring hollow if they only apply to speech that offends no one. The fact that Abbot was an invited guest rather than a member of the MIT community and the fact that he was offered an alternative (less prestigious and less public opportunity to speak about his research do not justify the cancellation of his original talk. With this decision, based purely on Abbot’s sincerely held ideological perspective outside his scientific contributions, the MIT administration has signaled loud and clear that diverse perspectives on important topics of the day are not welcome on campus. That in fact, even someone who speaks on a purely scientific topic must be vetted for their political views. Why should we care about academic freedom and free expression on campus? Those who feel that free expression is an outdated concept have very short memories. The movement to protect free expression on campus was, until recently, the purview of the left, and was intimately tied in with the anti-Vietnam War movement and the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The freedom to express unpopular, even upsetting or offensive, speech is crucial both to progressive social change and to the academic process. As individuals, it is deeply hypocritical to only stand up for the right to express our own views and not those we disagree with — freedom “for me but not for thee.” That is why the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU went to bat for a group of actual Nazis in the famousSkokie casein the late 1970s. They understood that limiting the fundamental right to free expression will inevitably silence the oppressed. As former president of the ACLU Nadine Strossenput it in her bookHate, such restrictions “are predictably enforced to suppress unpopular speakers and ideas, and too often they even are enforced to stifle speech of the vulnerable, marginalized minority groups they are designed to protect.” These words were specific to the legal protection of the First Amendment, but as Strossen makes clear, can be applied to free expression on campus as well. Specifically, the academic freedom of faculty to challenge the establishment is fundamental to the role that an academic institution like MIT must play in testing, debating, and discussing a diverse range of ideas about the important topics of the day, of which DEI clearly qualifies. As she writes, “In light of the enormous power of private universities… either to facilitate or stifle the free exchange of ideas and information… except in unusual circumstances, private universities should permit all expression that the First Amendment shields from government censorship.” If the only person harmed by the Abbot Affair were Abbot himself, this would be a relatively small concern; Abbot has weathered this just fine. But an administration that signals a lack of strong support for free expression on campus stifles speech across the board — in classrooms, research laboratories, dorm rooms, and the public square. This is not idle speculation; a recentHeterodox Academy surveyof American college students suggests that over 60% of students in 2020 (up from 55% in 2019 felt the climate on their campus prevented them from saying what they believe. A recent poll by theFoundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE suggeststhe situation for students at MIT may be even worse. Anda recent informal poll of MIT facultyfound close to 80% of respondents expressing concern about their free expression. MIT has recently convened an Ad Hoc Working Group on Free Expression. We encourage the members of this Working Group to carefully examine the history of academic freedom and free expression on campus. We urge them to bring back a recommendation for MIT to rededicate itself to the core principles that have spurred robust debate, and ensured that campus life is full of diverse perspectives and a healthy ecosystem of ideas, within a campus culture that values discussion and dissent. As a concrete suggestion, we urge MIT to explicitly adoptthe Chicago Principlesdefending free speech at universities. And we urge everyone in the MIT community who cares about free speech, viewpoint diversity, and academic freedom to join theMIT Free Speech Alliance.

crimson_2022_70,"If you’re reading this, that means we couldn’t pull together an op-ed in time. Don’t worry about it too much. Running out of op-eds isn’t a “scraping the bottom of the barrel” kind of situation; it’s more of a “leaky faucet slows to a drip.” It’ll fix itself in due time. It’s not as if we don’t have op-eds — a glance at our (endearing mess of an email inbox (quick plug: please submit your op-eds toop-eds@thecrimson.com will reveal stacks upon stacks of recently shared Google docs, drafts that are more suggestion than text, and back-and-forth email chains. The issue is that the op-eds pipeline is a capricious mistress. Sometimes the piece you think is going to be three edits and a fact check turns into a weeks-long endeavor. Sometimes the pieces pour in faster than we can turn them around, and sometimes the op-eds inbox is a cartoon desert complete with awkwardly drifting tumbleweeds. This year, we’re doing op-eds a little differently. That’s slightly because we’re doing staff editorials a little differently this year, letting discussions flow for longer and develop more of that classic editorial nuance, instead of rushing to get two topics down in an hour. There are three of us op-eds editors now (hi Eleanor and Jasmine , which is unprecedented. This offsets the fact that we occasionally have an empty “fifth slot” where a staff-ed would previously go, because op-eds, like glue, can plug all kinds of holes. So we generally have the Crimson’s Editorial page under control — although some nights, we end up needing to publish a piece like this: easy to fact check, not super editing-intensive, and with a chronically online author who checks their email and resolves suggestions like a bad compulsion. But the fact that sometimes, we do have to do stuff like this, throws into question whether the Editorial publishing system is really as well-oiled as it seems. Why do we, the Editorial Board of The Harvard Crimson, publish three pieces — generally one op-ed, one staff-ed, and one column — a day? We’ve been publishing daily for like a hundred years. I’ve heard from the voices of previous Editorial Chairs and implicit in the actions of our formidable Board of editors that we need to keep the paper running (or the “old sheet flying,” if you’re in our same Crimson club . Does our paper run on haphazard filler editorial content? Are we just biding the time between the high seasons of stellar op-ed submissions with whatever dregs we can scramble up in the meantime? I would hope not; at the very least, that would reflect poorly on my ability to do my job. But it is curious how we manage to keep this ship above the waves and churning out op-eds. We say we’re delivering quantity and quality both in our op-ed curation, thank you very much. If that’s true, what gives? Harvard students areincredibly opinionated, but they are also notoriously overextended. Who has the time or mental capacity to come up with an idea or perspective that’s never been published before, develop it into 650 to 850 words of thoughtful cogent writing, and undergo a grueling editing process with a potentially neurotic editor who keeps leaving comments about “dereferencing your vague pronouns” (like seriously, what’s up withthem , all to effectively throw your opinion into a sea of 2,000 and counting pieces that maybe a grand total of one really close friend will ever read and text you about? The Editorial Board, that’s who. Our internal writers are so strong, and I know because I’ve been keeping track of every single submission from them in a handy-dandy checkbox-filled spreadsheet. We are attending three hour-but-really-hour-and-a-half-long meetings a week, and submitting passionate op-eds on the issues we really care about, and overall keeping the opinion section spicy and full of hot takes. When Iturkey-shotfor op-eds editor, it was because I wanted to read and polish all these sparkling thoughts hot off their writers’ minds that make up the collective voice of the Harvard community. And I am very grateful that this is something I get to do now, night after night. My utmost respect goes out to our internal writers with their hearts beating with narrative structure and their beliefs they would defend until their dying breath, toiling through four or more op-eds a semester. It’s a marvel to see the Editorial page come together every night, even if most of those nights just involve me hunched over my laptop making little changes to phrasing and word choice. To the Harvard Crimson’s Editorial Board: I love you all a lot. But please address your edits with immense haste so we can get back to our scheduled op-ed programming tomorrow. We have to keep the paper running, after all. Christina M. Xiao ’24, an Associate Editorial Editor, is a joint concentrator in Computer Science and Government in Eliot House."
thetech_mit_2022_43,"Dear MIT collaborators, I am writing to share my thoughts about the proposed unionization of our graduate students. I have read and carefully considered the issues and vision advocated by those supporting graduate student unionization. I respect the viewpoints being offered. There are valid concerns expressed and things we can work together to fix. However, I remain sincerely opposed to having a graduate student union and am writing to express my perspective in this letter. The most basic reason I am opposed to unionization of our graduate students is simple: in all our best work, we are collaborators working together to expand the limits of knowledge into new territory and to contribute to solving many important problems. This creation of new understanding is very challenging, but it is something that MIT already does incredibly well. I assert that on the whole, MIT is one of the best places for this on the planet. Let’s expand the circle to identify things that need fixing and find innovative ways to make MIT work better for all of us. Let’s engage in this together. My reason for sincere concern is that I see a graduate student union as a mechanism for opposition between students and MIT. If we are opponents, then how do we continue to be full-on collaborators? Who can regulate or require, specify or delimit the energetic engagement and passion we bring to this community? I am certain that a union organization such as the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America cannot possibly understand how we really work together, nor contribute to our pursuit of excellence in so many areas. Blunt tools such as one-way demands or threats of strikes will not enable our mutual progress. We have the privilege to work together in an incredible and exciting learning community, enabled by the flow of insights and efforts among all the team members. Our creativity and excellence flow from these collaborative resonances. I am very concerned that adding prohibitions and layers of rules and requirements associated with a union will attenuate these resonances and threaten our mutual engagement with excellence, leading to a diminished MIT for all of us. A bit of context so you understand where I’m coming from: I have all three of my degrees from MIT in Course 6, so I know this place well from the perspectives of undergraduate life (alas, too long ago! and from the perspective of life as a graduate student. I care deeply about our students and want MIT to be an excellent experience that challenges and stretches abilities for all of us. I am writing to make my contribution to this upcoming important decision. I urge all graduate students to carefully read about and understand the issues and viewpoints being presented on unionization and to think carefully about how a graduate student union might contribute to or detract from our learning community. Then, be sure to vote in the upcoming April 4–5 election so that your view is counted. Sincerely, David L. TrumperProfessor of Mechanical Engineering"
crimson_2022_163,"“Mi nieto va a ser un doctor en América y estudia en Harvard.” “El hijo de mi amiga es un estudiante en Harvard.” “Conocí a un niño que nació aquí en México y ahora está estudiando en Harvard.” “¡Estamos tan orgullosos de ti! ¡Estás destinado para cosas grandes!” Harvard, for most of my family, is the equivalent of Hogwarts. It’s a place that is completely unimaginable and beyond our grasp: one where only celebrities, the 1 percent, and Harry Potter and company drink champagne, talk about the latest market trends, and decidewhere in the world to travelfor their next weekend trip. So, when one of their own is accepted into this illustrious world, the whole family celebrates, from a tequila shot in Monterrey, Mexico, to tears of joy in Saint Louis, Missouri. The miracle news spreads from friends to coworkers to the random stranger that my grandma just had to tell. Soon enough, people from all over the country and world are cheering and telling everybody and anybody who will stop to listen that one of their own has made it. For me and many others, we have achieved our parents’, grandparents’, and great-grandparents’ dreams. Their hard work has paid off. Their hardships, their sacrifices, their perseverance: It has all culminated in giving us better lives and opportunities than they ever had. Yet, when you have hundreds of eyes on you awaiting greatness and success, you cannot help but be nervous. You represent them. You represent the generations that helped you achieve your current place. Failure isn’t an option — but at Harvard, where the classes are difficult and everybody is the best of the best, failure always seems to be lurking. I understand that everyone feels the ever-present pressure at institutions like Harvard to perform well, in comps and classes alike. But the stress felt by me and other students, as products of generations of hardship and sacrifice, does not end when the final exam books close. It shadows us as the moral dilemma of whether we deserve to be here, with all of Harvard’s privilege and prestige, when many of our family members will never experience the same. As much as I have loved my time at Harvard, I can’t help but feel selfish. I feel selfish for attending Harvard because I know my dad would have loved to do the same if given the opportunity and resources to reach that opportunity earlier in life. There is an emotional dissonance in me between loving Harvard and feeling selfish for being here. Hearing the stories of how my parents grew up, I wish they could have had the same opportunities they constructed for me when they were younger. The irony is that, in a sense, my dad wanted this selfishness for me: He wanted to give me the resources and support that he never had, so I could fully chase my dreams. I am a temporary oxymoron, as both the egocentric Harvard student and the human record of my family’s history. But my family only ever intended for me to seize my dreams. They never wanted to shoulder me with the burden of the modern Latino Atlas, forever carrying a world of guilt. Centering ourselves and putting our own oxygen masks on first does not mean the abandonment of family, friends, and communities that have supported us. It does not mean that when we become hotshot lawyers, doctors, or analysts, our families come second. It means that we have the resources for the life our parents could never have dreamed for us and that we can use those resources for others in the same shoes as our parents or grandparents or beyond. We can provide greater opportunities for Latinos from Monterrey, Mexico, to Saint Louis, Missouri. Ultimately, we have the ability to transform the individual saying, “You made it out,” into the global celebration of “We made it out.” Mamá, Papá, Abuelitos y Abuelitas, los amo con todo mi corazón y un poco más. Estoy agradecido por los sacrificios y por el trabajo que han hecho por mi. Siempre voy a ser su niño chiquito. Los extraño y los veo pronto con un título de Harvard o Hogwarts. Markus I.

state_press_2022_16,"The University can t just illustrate the dangers of a global issue and the substantial difficulty of solving it to students, then expect there to be no impact on their well-being. There are several programs available at universities, including ASU, that cover areas of environmental science and sustainability in which students can learn theintricacies and threatsassociated with climate change.As a student at theSchool of Sustainability, I ve learned about the harmful impacts of climate change, but there seems to be less said about positive solutions or progress due to the lack of real global action. For many students, this creates feelings of unease and despair, which can eventually turn intoeco-anxiety– a mental health condition recognized as anxiety about environmental catastrophes related to climate change. This can manifest itself as a sense of grief, loss and fear over the future. According to asurveydone by the American Psychological Association, nearly half of young adults aged 18 to 34 said they felt stress over climate change in their daily lives. This concern rings especially true when considering the students that are exposed to narratives surrounding climate change on a daily basis in classrooms. Curriculums often unload the grave realities of the issue, then push responsibility onto students as the generation that will solve the crisis. There needs to be a more balanced approach that both informs students and supports them through the often gloomy nature of the content. Eco-anxiety is all around us, particularly the way we talk about sustainability. There s lots of mention of climate change and with the way it s framed, it can be very disempowering if we accept the narrative that we re doomed,” said Scott Cloutier, an assistant professor at the School of Sustainability and senior sustainability scientist at theGlobal Institute of Sustainability and Innovation. ASU boasts about its No. 1 in innovation ranking and highlights the recognition it gets for being anenvironmentally friendly campus, but this doesn t translate well into the actual course curriculums. As more large media sources cover worrying climate news, such as the most recentIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, students need reassurance and support in the classroom. The University can t just illustrate the dangers of a global issue and the substantial difficulty of solving it to students, then expect there to be no impact on their well-being. There must be more of an effort in classrooms to provideactions for students to takein their communities and more broadly in Arizona, as there s only so much you can do on a college campus. Educational institutions need to take the approach of educating people from the place of solution-building rather than climate doomism. Oftentimes, conversations around climate change can be end-all-be-all and make it seem as if there’s no hope,” said Saiarchana Darira, a campus ambassador for Defend Our Future ASU and a senior studying social and cultural analysis, global management and psychology. I ve struggled with eco-anxiety that sprouted after taking courses that delved into the climate struggles that many people are currently facing, and will continue to face in the near future. Luckily, I was able to connect and work with community organizations that tackle the impacts here in the Valley, which greatly helped me cope and feel proactive, rather than helpless. A more action-based approach to teaching about climate change could fill this gap that leaves many students facing eco-anxiety. The most beneficial and uplifting classes I ve taken in the sustainability program curriculum have been those focused on imagining what solutions look like and what it will take to reach them. While there s no clearly defined path in how to best teach students with eco-anxiety, this is an opportunity for the University to live up to its No. 1 ranking in innovation and become a stronger resource for future sustainability professionals. This process starts with providing more intentional resources to educators in order to support their students. Reach the columnist atbmecinas@asu.eduand follow@brianmecinason Twitter.

crimson_2022_89,"No, Latinidad does not assume a Mexican nationality. No, it does not include Spain. And no, it does not make you not-white. It also does not mean you speak Spanish. Think of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “In the Heights” and its cast, with its pale shades of brown and white people dancing to Afro-beats —not Latinidad. The political identity has worn many hats throughout its history: Latin-American, Hispanic, Latino, Latinx, and most recently, Latine. We rally to change its name time after time, to rebrand ourselves to fit the politics of the current ruling ideology. But perhaps the time has come to retire Latinidad, for it is nothing but a facade meant to erase the Black, Indigenous, poor, and other oppressed peoples of Latin America beneath the crushing weight of its long, colonial structure. The problem with Latinidad is not in its name, but in its function to reinforce a monolith of more than 660 million people into one identity, excluding — and killing, but more on that later on — those who do not fit its image. During the 2020 Presidential election, President Biden and his campaign made strong efforts to win over what has come to be known as the “Latino Vote” — quite literally the ballot of a person identifying as Latino. Humorously, they ran on promises of immigration reform, which included returning the caged children to their parents; Dreamers’ protection; and Latine Cabinet officials. However, Biden’s campaign was surprised when there was significant — or quite frankly, any — Latine support for Trump after his notorious xenophobic remarks. Biden and his team had assumed that all Latinos care about issues of immigration, poverty, and race. They had reached for a monolith too tall for even the presidency. I had once held a similar notion of blanket Latine identity. I went to high school with a majority of Mexican students. Of course, we had many white Mexicans, but it was not until I got to Harvard that I saw the degree of whiteness that Latinos could reach. I met my first set of Argentines and Cubans with winter white skin, sky blue eyes, and sun blonde hair. Mexican poet and Nobel Laureate Octavio Paz once famously said, “Mexicans are descended from the Aztecs, Peruvains from the Incas, and Argentinians from ships.” These are the general origin stories of three Latin American nations, the last alluding to the heavy European presence in Argentina, especially from Germany. I am not saying that all Argentines and Cubans are white. I know they are not. However, for onlyup to 9 percentof Argentinians today to hold African ancestry, despite the country importing about half as many enslaved people as the U.S. did, is shocking. Harvard’s Cubans shocked me because the only Cuban I “knew” all of my life was Black — Celia Cruz. It was upon meeting Harvard’s Argentines and Cubans that I learned of the thousands ofNazis that fled to Argentinaand of the wealthy, landowning, majority-whiteCubans that fled from communismto areas like Miami. Mexico, too, hasongoing violenceagainst its Black and Indigienous populations, the majority of whom live in poverty. Latinidad, rather than representing all the peoples it is meant to, assumes one experience from the white, Spanish-speaking, and Catholic-Christian people from Latin American nations, actively erasing and killing its Black, Indigenous, and poor people. Latinidad, in this violent, colonial form, must end. I championed Latinidad growing up, raised on myths of our ability to work hard and committed to represent the richness of Mexico. But when I set foot at this school, the monolith began to crumble. Latinidad has written its own undoing. It cannot synthesize all the people of Latin America into one identity. Yes, we can just begin using Latinidad to mean from a Latin American country, but what then? Will systemic racism and ethnic and racial cleansing cease in these countries? Will the material conditions of its Black, Indigneous, and poor people better and allow them joy and life? At Harvard, there are multiple Latine clubs. Yet these clubs have visibly subpar membership from Brown Latines, let alone the negligible amount from Black Latines. In fact, some of these clubs are led by white Latines. There may even be a Spanish student in the Harvard Organization of Latin America, despite Spain being a European country. Latinidad at Harvard is nothing more than a lie. The lies of Latinidad go far back, surround us, and cut deep. They kill. To not question Latinidad, even with the hope to better it, if not end it, is to perpetuate its colonial violence. Let us retire the term for the time being while it is questioned and speak on subjects with specificity. Before we can address issues faced disproportionately by Black, Indigenous, and poor people in Latin American countries, the colonial tower of Latinidad must be toppled.

wildcat_arizona_2022_58,"It can be hard for college students to save money and have fun, but there are many discounts they can use to help keep costs down. Let’s face it, one of the trademarks of being a college student is the fact that we’re always broke. The level of financial strain may vary, but many of us share the same sentiment of how expensive being a college student is. College students have a range of expenses to worry about that are both directly and indirectly caused by their decision to pursue higher education. We have to worry about tuition, housing, textbooks, school supplies, transportation, food, the list goes on. And that doesn’t include the other miscellaneous costs that we may bring into our college experiences such as cellphone plans, clothes to wear for important occasions, internet service or car insurance. Considering all of these costs into the typical college student’s budget, it doesn’t leave much room for a student to indulge in any form of entertainment. Want to go to the movies? Well, be prepared to just eat instant ramen for the next couple of weeks. Luckily for us, companies out there understand the strain our pockets go through on a daily basis and have granted us one of the many perks of being a student: student discounts. I have compiled a list of 10 student discounted online subscriptions that college students can take advantage of. 1.Amazon Prime Amazon Prime is a membership program Amazon offers that comes with a variety of perks. These perks include free two-day shipping, access to Amazon Video (Amazon’s streaming service , unlimited photo storage with Prime Photos, access to Prime Music, special deals and more. The cost of an Amazon Prime subscription for typical users is about $14.99 monthly and $139 yearly, however, Amazon offers a special discount for students called Amazon Prime Student. Amazon Prime Student subscriptions are roughly 50% off the regular price ($7.49 monthly and $69 yearly . All that you need to receive this discount is your university student email to confirm your status and for four years you’ll receive this discounted price. Not sure if Amazon Prime is for you? Another cool perk that comes with the student discount is that students start off with a six-month free trial when signing up. So, you’ll be able to enjoy swift deliveries as well as watch the latest Prime Video movies and shows. 2.Grubhub+ Grubhub is a food ordering and delivery app that adds a layer of convenience for users. It is especially popular amongst college students and college campuses, partnering with over 250 college campuses according toRestaurant Dive. Grubhub offers a membership program called Grubhub+ that offers perks to users such as unlimited free delivery on orders $12 or more from selected restaurants, Elite Care (VIP customer service and other added benefits. This membership normally costs $9.99 monthly. There is no direct discount on the cost, but students who have an Amazon Prime Student account can sync their account to their Grubhub account and receive Grubhub+ for free. This lasts as long as they have an Amazon Prime Student account. Students should be aware though that if they have alcohol in their orders, the Grubhub+ benefits won’t apply. 3.Hulu Hulu is a video streaming service that offers access to popular movies and films as well as offers original content. There are two levels of membership that come with this service. The ad-supported plan costs about $6.99 monthly while the no-ads plan costs about $12.99 monthly. Students get a discounted price when signing up for Hulu that only costs students $1.99 monthly, however, this plan is ad-supported so students will receive ads while watching their video content. If students already have a Hulu account, they can switch to the student plan by accessing their account page and selecting the Hulu student discount. In either case, students will be prompted to verify their enrollment status by inputting their university student email. Hulu uses a third-party verification service called SheerID to verify their status. This discount will last for four years. 4.Paramount+ Paramount+ is another video streaming service that gives users access to a variety of content ranging from live sports, movies, shows and original content. A typical Paramount+ membership costs about $4.99 monthly for the ad-supported plan as well as about $9.99 monthly for the commercial-free plan. Paramount+ offers a discount for students that takes 25% off the basic plan which roughly equals around $3.74 monthly. This plan is ad-supported so students will receive ads while watching video content. To get this discount, students will need to verify their student credentials which includes their name, date of birth and name of their university. Once verified, students will have access to this discounted price for four years. 5.Discovery+ For any students who are history buffs or reality TV bingers, Discovery+ is the video streaming service for them. Discovery+ offers content that includes networks like “Food Network,” “Animal Planet,” “TLC” and more. A subscription costs about $4.99 monthly for the ad-supported plan and $6.99 monthly for the ad-free plan. Discovery+ offers a discounted price of $2.99 monthly for the ad-supported plan, which is roughly 40% off the regular price. Students who sign up for the first time will receive a seven-day free trial. In order to receive this discounted price, students must verify their student status with student documentation. This may include a student ID, a class schedule or anything that proves a student’s enrollment status. Discovery+ uses a third-party verification service called SheerID in order to verify status. Students will have to re-verify every 12 months in order to continue receiving this discounted price.

crimson_2022_66,"Alfred B. Nobel’s1895 willreads, in part: “All of my remaining realisable assets are to be disbursed as follows: the capital, converted to safe securities by my executors, is to constitute a fund, the interest on which is to be distributed annually as prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind,” including “one part to the person who made the most important chemical discovery or improvement.” Though Nobel’s family was dismayed at this prospect, after five years of debate, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1901. Since then the Academy has continued to do so annually, save for eight years throughout the 20th century when no winners were awarded. Honorees of this prestigious award receive a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of Swedish crowns equivalent to approximately $1 million. Chemistry undergraduates will immediately recognize the first three laureates’ names. We encounter Henry van ‘t Hoff, winner of the 1901 prize, through the van ‘t Hoff equation in thermodynamics. Organic chemistry students become familiar with Emil Fischer, the 1902 laureate, via the Fischer esterification reaction and learning to draw Fischer projections. And every student of kinetics has analyzed at least a few Arrhenius plots, named for 1903 laureate Svante Arrhenius, at some point in their career. What chemist wouldn’t want to join this pantheon of great scientists? Of course all scientists want their work to “confer the greatest benefit to humankind.” At what point, however, does pursuit of the Nobel lose its nobility? The truth is that “Nobel fever” has infected many chemists and scientists, seeping into undergraduate educations and institutions everywhere. From the very first semester of organic chemistry, a graduate student half-jokingly suggests that for solving a great question in chemistry, you’ll win a Nobel prize. The importance of the Nobel becomes increasingly clear as professors tell us which concepts in our curriculum had won a Nobel prize in this or that year, as if its importance were validated by only the prize and not its effect on the greater world. We talk about great chemists in class as dying controversially without a Nobel, (like cross-coupling pioneer John K. Stille as if the prize were divine judgment, with Saint Peter at the gates of heaven asking to see your gold medal before granting entry. Frequent talk about the Nobel is not particularly motivating to undergraduates, though. More relevant to us is the content of the science — not the industry’s plaudits. The abstruse rules of the prize, such as only three individuals maximum being allowed to share one award, are inconsistent with the collaborative nature of science that we are taught to embrace and value. The system perpetuates itself: Students impressed with the Nobel’s importance will go on to view scientific achievement through this golden lens that overlooks the crucial contributions of every team member. Harvardflauntsits faculty Nobel laureates, posting extensive interviews and reaction videos with them, as if to set the expectation that professors here should be attracting Sweden’s attention. Former Harvard Chemistry chair Charles M. Lieber’s recent conviction, in which he cited Nobel aspirations, is just another consequence of working with an eye towards the Nobel. Chemistry is widely called “the central science” for its middle position between the physical and life sciences. Lieber himself straddled the two, his research focusing on developing nanomaterials and electronics to help treat brain diseases and injuries. Chemists worldwide come to work every day to advance not just chemistry, but physics, materials science, biology, and medicine as well. Our field’s interdisciplinary work is one of its most valuable and irreplaceable strengths. We hope that this spirit of collaboration will continue to animate chemistry research everywhere. Chemistry’s centrality has never been more apparent: The solutions to many of the world’s most pressing issues, from Covid-19 to climate change and global hunger, all depend, in one way or another, on the work of chemists and the entire scientific community. As students who make up the next generation of scientists, we affirm the power that chemical institutions have to fight diseases, preserve the natural world, and improve humanity’s quality of life. We are grateful to have role models who believe the same. It’s time for science to free itself from Stockholm’s yoke. After all, those who stay up late waiting for a certain midnight call will sleep through saving the world in the morning.

rice_thresher_2022_62,"ByMadison Bunting2/1/22 10:45pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. As student director of the Peer Career Advisor program with the Center for Career Development, I am passionate about ensuring everyone feels equipped along their career journey. Advising students has made me keenly aware of the anxiety and disappointment stemming from the COVID economy; it has also given perspective on common misconceptions about career exploration and campus resources, one of which is the idea that because a student meets with the CCD, they will automatically get an offer for their dream job. Although offices across campus exist to support students, it is ultimately up to students to take ownership of their own careers. Ownership means taking initiative to ask for help, even when it’s scary. For me, this started with scheduling a career advising meeting, in which I promptly started crying because I felt so lost and anxious about what path I should take post-graduation. In response, the advisor helped me see what valuable skills I already possessed and shared options commensurate with my interests, along with ways to explore them. If I would not have taken the initiative to schedule the meeting, I would not have known about the variety of career options that aren’t widely discussed, and I definitely would not have known best practices for landing my internships. Ownership means championing your experiences, even if they don’t feel relevant. As I’ve grown in my career knowledge, I realized companies care a lot less about what I did in my past positions than I thought; they care why and how what I did provided me with applicable skills that will make me good at the job to which I am applying. This shifted how I think about job searching to highlight thosetransferable skills. When done right, my roommate should be able to identify theaction verb, content and impact or resultin every bullet on my resume. I also learned to be inspired by verbs from job descriptions: the best way to demonstrate I can “leverage data to deliver insights” is to include a bullet about “leveraging prior stock data to identify trends” in a COMP 140 project. Ownership means doing the research. It felt like my early career meetings amounted to advisors referring me to online documents and resources. Now I understand why: Before addressing the nuances of my materials, I needed to have the basics, and it was more time-efficient to share documents than to verbalize the information they contain. One of the biggest things I’ve learned for efficient meetings is to review resources on the office or company’s website in advance — it can save time, increase confidence, provide context, and improve conversation quality. In interviews, re-reading the job description, reviewing company values, and looking the company up on Google news differentiates those who have done their homework from those who have not because prepared candidates understand the culture and how their prospective role fits into the company’s mission. Ownership means being mindful of the recruiter’s time. On average, they spend7.4 secondslooking at a resume, and computer systems filter out most templates. Every fraction of a second spent trying to find dates because I used a format I thought would make me stand out is time they are not spending being impressed by my resume’s contents. In this case, simple is best. Similarly, after info sessions, I saw recruiters quickly become overrun with students trying to make a good impression. I learned they actually remember students who are aware of others in the conversation, ask questions that aren’t Google-able, and are mindful of their time (maybe even offering to help clean up after the session . Ownership means building your own relationships.Eighty-five percent of jobs are secured through networking. Although I do not come from a well-connected background, attending workshops helped me learn to maximize resources such as LinkedIn and Sallyportal to reach Rice’s surprisingly responsive alumni network. I’ve talked with over 100 former Rice students, and their combined perspectives helped me see past the marketing to what prestigious jobs are really like. This also helped me feel more grounded as I understood how my current campus involvement truly is building relevant skills, and these conversations helped me feel more comfortable as I went through the recruiting process with different companies. Regardless of how we spend our time on campus, we are ultimately at Rice because we want a career someday. Controlling your career is about being aware of the opportunities around you and putting in the work to take advantage of them. The CCD and PCAs are great resources, but they cannot guarantee you a job. How will you take ownership of your future? April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

As the workers closest to our work,weare the experts on what resources we need in the workplace to successfully produce MIT’s world-class innovations and discoveries.A majority of graduate workers have signed our union cards because we fundamentally believe that we deserve a voice in our workplace — and unionizing is the only way to guarantee us legally-enforceable negotiating power to win the tools that we need to be outstanding researchers. Through thousands of conversations with our coworkers, it has become clear that MIT does not provide us with sufficient resources to efficiently produce the best research possible. Many of us lack the equipment and materials we need, have difficulty accessing centralized research infrastructure due to lack of staffing or high turnover (for example, in administrative and core facilities roles , waste excessive time fixing outdated equipment, and have unremediated lab safety concerns. We have been frustrated when we have spoken up about these issues individually and been ignored or dismissed. Even when our advisors have tried to help, the issues only ever seem to rise one or two rungs up the hierarchy of MIT’s bureaucracy, remaining unaddressed. Administrators claim it is out of their hands to address staffing and facilities issues. By standing together on these issues which span labs, departments, and schools, our union can amplify our collective voice to create material improvements on these workplace issues. Graduate workers at MIT currently lack a well-defined job description, leaving the boundaries of our responsibilities extremely ambiguous. As a result, when there is an inappropriate lack of investment in support staff and research infrastructure, we are forced to pick up the slack. Research already involves an incredibly diverse workload: designing and conducting experiments, fabricating materials and devices, analyzing data and characterizing our systems, generating figures, and writing papers. When we also have to take on administrative or maintenance tasks, it detracts from our ability to do researchwell. Though many universities,including MIT, claim that graduate students aren’t workers, many MIT graduate researchers spend a disruptive fraction of their time — or even a majority — on tasks that don’t directly advance their research or their education. For science and engineering fields, when a lab doesn’t have a lab manager or consistent administrative support, we graduate researchers are often roped into tasks like: Ordering equipment and supplies (submitting purchasing orders, meeting with sales representatives, drafting budget proposals . Researching, managing, and maintaining equipment, service contracts, and vendor relationships. Fixing machines that are only broken because they’re either too old to be serviced or being used for tasks they aren’t designed for. Providing administrative help in classes for which we are not TAs (making copies, running Canvas, teaching classes when the PI has a scheduling conflict . Scheduling group meetings or visitor agendas. Manufacturing our own reagents or testing apparatuses. Working on pet projects for our PIs instead of our dissertation research. Writing our PIs’ grants and reports without their help or contributions. Serving as our PIs’ personal moving crew when they move facilities. Serving as our PIs’ babysitter or petsitter. For graduate researchers, saying no to these tasks complicates our relationships with our advisors. We do this unpaid work because we fear for our funding, timeline for graduation, and prospect for job recommendations.With a union, we will be able to delineate basic job descriptions for graduate workers, and most importantly, we will have the power to ensure our time is spent on advancing research rather than fixing broken equipment.Recognizing the heterogeneity of research across the Institute, we can establish and enforce clear bounds on what an RAship is and is not. The MIT dogma of decentralization insists that every Department/Lab/Center’s (DLC needs are so unique that they cannot possibly adopt any of the same policies and practices successfully. But the reality is, across all departments, we share some common struggles that prevent us from researching in an efficient and sustainable way: Unclear job descriptions and workload expectations. Inadequate protection of university holidays, sick days, and vacation days. Unclear guidelines within research collaborations between groups or institutions. Mental or physical health issues. Inconsistent or inadequate mentorship. Lack of adequate work space. Of course, there are still department or field-specific issues. Some departments don’t guarantee PhD students year-round funding. Others haveattrition rate gapsandqualifying examinitial pass ratediscrepancies between genders and underrepresented minorities. Researchers in the humanities and social sciences have fixed-term funding schedules, with little opportunity for extensions or dissertation-year fellowships. This makes the situation for these researchers more precarious, in particular when they sufferdelays to their research, or when the job market worsens, ashas happened during the pandemic. The MIT Graduate Student Union (GSU is composed of a majority of workers in every department to capture a diversity of experiences when developing bargaining goals. Ensuring representation will give us the opportunity to negotiate a contract that meets every department’s —and every worker’s— needs. Other graduate worker unions have won contract provisions guaranteeing access to the equipment, facilities, and institutional support that graduate workers reasonably need to do their jobs (see, for example, theUniversity of Michigan,University of Connecticut, andUniversity of California system . Contracts also protect graduate workers from overwork and burnout by setting clear standards for work hours and time off — while allowing graduate workers to work more than the specified amountfor their own research and teaching goalswhen they choose to do so.Union contracts empower graduate workers to manage our time in a way that is healthy, balanced, and constructive. Teachers unionize toreduce class sizesso they can focus on providing the best education possible to their students. Nurses unionize tofight understaffing so they can give their patients quality care.We’re unionizing so we can focus on conducting world-class research.Only when every single scholar at MIT — every electrical engineer, historian, chemist, architect, evolutionary biologist — is empowered to show up fully for their work will we reach our true potential. Join us bysigning your union cardtoday."
state_press_2022_41,"Inclusivity trainings include online Canvas courses that discuss topics such as race, gender, relationships and indigenous communities. ASU mandatesinclusivity trainingfor all of its faculty, but some staff members are skeptical of if these trainings are doing enough for the diverse groups on campus. While they attempt to increase awareness, ASU s inclusivity trainings seem to be lacking when it comes to tangible, material change for minority communities. These trainings include online Canvas courses that discuss topics such as race, gender, relationships and indigenous communities. ASU philosophy graduate student Scout Etterson talked about their perception of the inclusivity trainings, and their belief that they essentially only accomplish virtue signaling. If it s doing anything good, it s putting on the face that we should be an accepting community – it s good to show that face, Etterson said. However, having that face of acceptance is simply not enough for there to be any change that goes below surface level. It is obvious that there are issues with how performative these trainings are, especially since ASU still sees its fair share of bigotry. It s maybe putting on a little bit too nice of a face, Etterson said. It s signaling that there is something that s not there, which is a community that s 100 percent clear of racism and sexism, homophobia and transphobia. In order to really address these issues, Etterson claims that the University should first require faculty to attend in-person trainings with people who are qualified to speak about diversity, and secondly, that money should be allocated to the right places. I would be surprised if (funding was going to Indigenous communities and queer communities and other underrepresented people, they said. ASU encourages staff to have pronouns and land acknowledgments in their email sign-offs.Land acknowledgmentsare formal statements that recognize Indigenous territories upon which the University was built. While land acknowledgments and widespread denotations of pronouns create awareness, they are not instilling tangible change in Indigenous populations or queer communities. ASU does offer some resources and programs to Indigenous students through itsAmerican Indian Student Support Services, but the site connects students to external resources in terms of food banks and housing centers. Programs such asSPIRIT,Mentor U, and theNative American Achievement Programconnect students to professional and academic resources and guidance, butit is unclear how they assist Native American students and non-Native American students with building lasting communities together. Assistant director of the cultural connections for ASU s Educational Outreach and Student Services and advisor for the Black African Coalition Ebony Anderson spoke candidly about her role in these positions, which includes overseeing diversity trainings. I think that (the coursework is a good conversation starter, but it s not enough that someone can interpersonally take something away from it, Anderson said. She believes that the inclusivity training at ASU is very high-level, but states that it is more concerned with raising awareness rather than facilitating physical change. Anderson recalled a time when an Indigenous chief visited ASU and tapped a land acknowledgment sign while calling it unimpressive. Acknowledgment is not for them. It’s for us, Anderson said. If you re an Indigenous person, you see that sign, and you don’t have a sigh of relief of Oh, at least they recognize that this land used to belong to us. There’s no solace in that. While the inclusivity training at ASU may promote important first steps such as increasing awareness surrounding diverse communities, it falls short of promoting material change that faculty and students can implement in their lives. Focusing on community-building efforts, listening to underrepresented students voices, and allocating funding to these communities can help bridge the gap between performative awareness and intentional advocacy.

crimson_2022_134,"Congratulations, Class of 2022! You’ve survived, endured, and thrived through some of the most difficult years in recent memory. As you emerge from these tough times and start a new chapter in your lives, it’s important to sit at this moment and celebrate everything you have overcome and achieved to get here. This is your moment to cherish. It also serves as a moment of reflection. The next phase of your life will likely be very different from what’s come before. I offer you three stories and lessons from my own life that will hopefully serve you wherever your path might lead. 1. Ground yourself in gratitude and service. Born deep in Pakistani mango country, I was destined for a very different life until my mom won the lottery. The visa lottery, that is — a wild chance that landed my family and me in the United States. Growing up here was hard. We struggled with housing insecurity and survived only thanks to food stamps. Through that time, I became deeply committed to ensuring that my family escaped poverty and that others did not have to endure the same experience we did. This self-imposed pressure was a heavy weight to carry, but by grounding myself, I found resilience through the tough times. I was, and still am, so thankful just to be here. I know I have pure luck to thank for the opportunities I have today and I am grateful for being welcomed with open arms into the Cambridge community. As graduates of a prestigious university, you have so many opportunities, and thus so many difficult decisions to make. How do you balance career growth, financial success, and meaningful work? How do you live up to the prestige and measure your life’s success? The anxiety of these decisions can be paralyzing. Don’t paralyze yourself. Ground yourself in gratitude and service. 2. You will fail often. Fail upwards. I lost every single election I was ever in — from middle school student body representative to my first City Council race. I always tried my hardest, pushed the boundaries, and ultimately ended up as a strong second place. That is until I won my first election. Now, all everyone remembers is “Youngest Cambridge City Councilor Ever Elected.” We only see the highlight reels of those we admire, but behind every successful individual is a string of failures, from bad auditions and rejected papers to bankrupt startups and lost elections. The mistake is thinking that failure is the end of the road or the wrong direction. Hardship is part of the journey. You will fail before you succeed. Embrace it. Learn from it. Use it as a stepping stone. 3. Happiness is not a checklist. A good friend of mine recently took her own life. She was so young and had achieved every metric of success: she had professional accolades, financial stability, supportive parents, and a loving partner. She was the last person I was worried about. But sadly, happiness cannot be passively collected; it must be actively grown. As smart, ambitious graduates with big dreams, you’ve put a lot of time and effort into honing your craft and creating the conditions for success in your career. Have you set yourself up for fulfillment and inner peace in the same way? You have finished your time at Harvard, and for many of you, this will be your last time in a structured academic setting. Friends won’t come by automatically and there will always be important work that needs to get done. Don’t get lost in reaching your own internal goals. The destination is important; find a way to also enjoy your journey. The guardrails are off and life is now a marathon. These are the three lessons I leave you with: find your grounding, fail upwards, and enjoy the journey. Burhan Azeem is a member of the Cambridge City Council."
ubyssey_2022_29,"May 6, 2022 Written byAquila UnderwoodandJulianna Yue The lack of Indigenous media was prominent when we grew up. Our experience being Indigenous as seen on TV wasBrother BearorPocahontas. We didn’t realize that the ‘Indian’ that kids would pretend to be was probably one of our ancestors — not some joke for entertainment. We were raised with the thought that our people were a joke and that our reality was false. We didn’t understand why we could never relate to anyone on the TV, why we were uncomfortable going to the houses of white friends and why it was easier to pretend to be anything other than Indigenous when we were asked about our race. Eventually, as we’ve grown, we have watched Indigenous media grow and evolve with us, as the shame has lessened and the race to reclaim has become more urgent. We’re seeing more Indigenous representation on TV, the resurgence of Indigenous art — tattooing, beading, carving, storytelling — and the growth of Indigenous presence on social media.@statlew_,@intheforest.tattooand@lisa.beadingare some artists who bring these realms together. Finally, Indigeneity is something we can relate to as members of the lost generations who have been raised on ‘white is right.’ We finally have something for us again, something that we can truly be proud of. Despite this growth, this desire to be proud, there is still a preconception that Indigeneity is something to hide, something to be ashamed of — especially in our generation. As we struggle to regain our identity in the wake of what most would consider an apocalypse, the end of the world as we, Indigenous peoples, know it. Sure, some will protest at the word ‘apocalypse’ but these people cannot imagine what we have been through. The way that we think now, talk now and live now are all different. Our existence was not born of gradual and welcomed change but a forceful shift in everything we knew. But now, more than ever, we as Indigenous people are finally reclaiming ourselves. In order to reclaim our world, we are constantly searching for new ways to share our lives, experiences, emotions and art. As young Indigenous people, we want to take part in this growth and movement. We seek to create a platform of change, a place for Indigenous kin to share their stories and to have their voices heard. Through storytelling and participatory action, we are creating a zine that acts as a concrete document of our lived experiences navigating a post-colonial world and the diasporas that exist on land that was once our own. We have titled this zineLost & Found, alluding to the colonial foundations of so-called ‘Canada’ and continuous Indigenous resistance and resurgence. It is open to all Indigenous people of colour who wish to have somewhere to put their thoughts on living life in a colonial world as an Indigenous person. We hopeLost & Foundwill be a place where you feel welcomed to contribute and learn, to take and share and to reclaim the Indigeneity that was once taken from us. If you want to contribute toLost & Foundplease contact Aquila Underwood (aq.underwood@gmail.com or Julianna Yue (juliannayue@gmail.com .

rice_thresher_2022_35,"ByThresher Editorial Board4/19/22 11:01pm Last year, the Board of Trusteesannouncedthat Rice would be increasing the undergraduate class size 20 percent — nearly 800 more students — by 2025. The quick rollout of this decision has left current students with a fracturing academic and social experience. Going forward, the administration needs to better plan for maintaining the small school benefits and residential college culture. For one thing, without the imminent twelfth college yet built, the larger student population is facing a housing shortage directly impacting residential college culture, one of the aspects of undergraduate life most advertised to prospective students. An integral part of the system is that students spend most of their Rice years living on campus to fully immerse themselves in college culture. But with the recent increase in admitted students only set to grow, more and more students will be pushed off campus until that new residential college is ready for occupants. Only new students are guaranteed housing, and as most sophomores and juniors are kicked off, less and less will return as seniors — the people who are crucial for teaching college culture to new students. We recognize that other issues such as housing quality and the evolving pandemic have led more students at some colleges to choose to live off campus. Still, the increase in students has decreased housing availability across all colleges in a way that will exponentially affect each incoming class. Especially in the time of COVID where so many traditions are in danger of being lost, the distancing between under and upperclassmen will only exacerbate the issue. In his outgoing feature this week, President Leebron specifically spotlighted the residential college system for “bringing Rice this whole distinct sense of welcome and community and providing students with a larger social unit than is provided at both smaller and larger colleges.” We agree that those are the great benefits of the colleges, and it was a factor in many of our personal decisions to come to Rice. But even in the two to four years members of this editorial board have been here, we have seen that culture change, in part from the changing class makeup of on-campus students. The impact of the quick undergraduate population expansion has had a tremendous effect on the academic experience as well. During O-Week 2021, many new studentscould not registerfor their core major classes because they filled up. It was only after this issue arose that a more proactive effort was made to add more sections and seats for these classes. The administration already knew they had more students than expected, and though they recommended for certain departments to expand and add sections before O-Week, they must recognize that this cannot be a total solution untilmore facultyare hired and building expansions are completed. We want to be clear that we are not protesting the expansion, which is also a national trend as almost every university is seeing higher application rates and growing their student bodies to match. The issue we take is with the order in which the administration chose to act, first by expanding the student numbers amid the pandemic and then reacting to the growth with new buildings and additional class sections. In the future, we would hope before making such an impactful decision, those in charge have better plans and preparation to make sure current and incoming students are actually able to enjoy the Rice experience we were promised. Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Savannah Kuchar, Ben Baker-Katz, Nayeli Shad, Talha Arif, Morgan Gage, Daniel Schrager and Brandon Chen. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_31,"Last month, a Daily Beast reportallegedthat Herschel Walker, the Georgia football legend and Republican nominee for U.S. Senate, encouraged and paid for his girlfriend’s abortion in 2009. As far as explosive allegations go, this was — or should have been — meteoric. A staunchly pro-life candidate, who in the spring called for no exceptions to abortion bans for rape, incest, or the health of the mother (a position he latersoftened , was allegedly guilty of violating the most sacred of conservative bona fides. And if it wasn’t stunning by itself, it was only the tip of the iceberg of Walker’s hypocrisy. A passionate opponent of absentee fatherhood throughout his campaign, Walker was forced to confirm that he is the absentee father of multiple children. A fierce advocate for family values, Walker had to weather a callout from his own son, a conservative activist whoclaimedthat his father forced him and his mother “to move over 6 times in 6 months” to escape the threat of domestic violence. If Walker were a vegan, he would be the carnivorous kind. None of this has stopped the GOP from packaging Walker as a true conservative. He is the GOP’s Georgian darling, at least until the Dec. 6 runoff against Senator Raphael Warnock and possibly far longer. In all likelihood, the Senate will be controlled by razor-thin margins, and Walker’s candidacy represents one of a few key prospects for Republicans to gain control. In this context, a vote for Walker needn’t actually be a vote for Walker. For most, it is wholly aimed at securing the votes he will deliver in the Senate. Conservative activist Dana Loeschwasmost succinct on this point: “I don’t care if Herschel Walker paid to abort endangered baby eagles. I want control of the Senate.” Republicans in Georgia have no real candidate — only his positions — to cling to with excitement. But I bring Walker up not to further lambaste his stupefying hypocrisy or malign voters who support him. Instead, I aim to draw attention to a much larger incentive problem in our politics, one that is true for the Left, too: Voting for Walker and people like him is a perfectly rational choice for conservatives — arguably the only one. I’ll easily grant that policy matters more than politicians. From any place on the political spectrum, a flawed messenger of a good idea is better than a pure messenger of a bad one. But it should raise eyebrows for all of us when conservatives who preach the sanctity of prenatal life and family cohesion are compelled by necessity to support candidates who utterly disregard their most cherished ideals. It’s easy to extrapolate Walker’s insincerity to the voters who got him here — after all, this is a democracy — but this is vastly reductive, unfair, and useless. We won’t arrive at better political outcomes by belittling millions of people. And doing so would obscure the fact that the political system in which we operate consistently implores all of us, voters and leaders alike, to make poor choices. Bad incentives lead to bad outcomes all across our electoral process. In single-party primaries, more extreme candidates often seek to prove their partisan purity and impress pundits and interest groups. And when extreme candidates are selected by their respective parties, the high stakes of a one-on-one race don’t allow for anything less than unequivocal support all the way up through the finish. When parties must support their extreme nominees in lockstep, it sets a clear standard: even moderate politicians must toe the party line. There is little incentive to moderate or compromise, and dissenting can bear with it huge political costs. But political benefits can be found elsewhere. Instead, politicians are rewarded for flashy sound bites, appeasing party leadership, and pandering to prominent interest groups. The high visibility and concentration of lawmakers on platforms like Twitter further raise the cost of breaking ranks. So, too, does the top-down rule of party leadership in Congress, where that cost isremoval from committeesand stunted opportunities for advancement. What does our vast incentive problem mean for Herschel Walker? Despite all my grievances, this is not really about him. He is a case study — a representation of one of the bad outcomes that occur everywhere in our political system. And though his hypocrisy is more overt and staggering than that of most politicians, his viable candidacy in many ways vividly illustrates how a well-intentioned political system can damage itself when weaknesses are left to ferment. Like the rest of our bad outcomes, it’s generally neither fair nor productive to expend energy chastising the voters who chose Walker. Here at Harvard and beyond, we must encourage a shift in paradigm, looking beyond just our politicians and towards the much larger forces that select and debase them. Don’t take Herschel Walker’s candidacy as a fundamental indictment of Republican voters or the state of Georgia. Instead, focus on the system that transformed an awful candidate into a legitimate and likely choice for the Senate. Lucas T.

stanforddaily_2022_61,"Christian Sanchez is a first-year non-traditional transfer student majoring in English with a focus in Philosophy and Literature and incoming ASSU Executive VP. This opinion does not reflect that of the ASSU or any other institution with which he is affiliated. I can only imagine the feeling of those who witnessed the blatant disregard for humanity when seeing the noose tied to the tree outside of Branner Hall on May 8, 2022. I am not surprised that someone would put their perceived superiority and elitism on display so brazenly. The dark history of lynching and the bigoted action of displaying a noose is synonymous with racial aggression toward those who are of African American descent — but an often overlooked part of that history is the lynching that targeted Mexican natives and Mexican Americans for eight decades. As a person who values my identity and as an agent of change, I would like to educate those who are unaware of the history that surrounds those lynchings, which took place in the southwest and in Santa Clara County. People of Mexican origin and Mexican Americans entered a racial crisis after the Mexican-American War. After the annexation and occupation of the southwest by the United States, mob violence was a reality that plagued Mexicanos, even despite theTreaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which allowed Mexicans already living in the US-occupied southwest to remain landowners and gain civil rights. It is important that this history be acknowledged, especially in a time where discussions of racial injustice in the United States often center on Black and white identities. Mexican Americans were also hanged by white supremacist vigilante groups, primarily as retribution in absence of a formal justice system; these acts were never called into question because white culture did not care that Mexicans were hanged. White vigilante and outlaw justice were commonplace in the Wild West, and the justice system was still in its infancy, leading to the heinous and inhumane lynchings of Mexicans based on race and unfounded accusations. Mexican Americans were victims of almost600 lynchings between 1848 and 1928. These lynchings began in the California Gold Rush —about 170 lynchings happened from 1848 to 1860— and ended a decade after the Mexican Revolution. By moving Mexicans out of gold mines in San Francisco, white vigilantes would scare off thousands of Mexican miners from their organized gold-hunting groups to steal their gold and resources. Eventually, this tactic led to unjust lynchings of Mexican and Mexican American people based on race and economic competition. In Texas,where over 280 lynchings took place from 1848 to 1928, lynchings were justified by the sentiment that “Texas Country” was no place for Mexicans and that it was not a crime, morally, to kill a Mexican. As a result of being cut off from economic growth opportunities in the southwest, Mexicans began turning into bandits or “banditos,” most of whom were political revolutionaries acting against their economic exclusion. White Americans interpreted these “banditos” as lawless nuisances and killed them in response. In retaliation to the discrimination and violent attacks, Mexican natives and Mexican Americans drafted a call to action called the“Plan of San Diego,”whichcalledfor native Mexicans and Mexican Americans to kill all white males ages 16 and older. As a result of this plan, white Americans killed an undocumented number of Mexican natives and Mexican Americans. Ultimately, over the final two decades of this violent outbreak, several civil rights groups fought for the abolition of mob violence targeting Mexicans and Mexican Americans. Although there were many breakthroughs for their African American compatriots, the larger American population was still not sold on the citizenship of Mexicans. Despite increased awareness of the issue of lynching during the civil rights movement, there was still little awareness ofthe lynchings of Mexican natives and Mexican Americans. The hanging of Tiburcio Vásquez is tied closely to the history of Santa Clara. In white America, he was considered a bandito during the height of Mexican resistance to white American lynchings of Mexicans and Mexican Americans.Vásquez was tried and convicted of murder and theft, and although he maintained his innocence, he was hanged outside of thecourthouseon North First Street in San Jose on March 19, 1875. The courthouse still stands in the same location. Being a Chicano at Stanford means a lot to me. I am the first in my family to go to a university, and I am the first in my family to pursue a graduate degree. I am trying to be the example I want my children to follow — not of going to college, but of resilience and motivation to pursue one’s dreams and passions. Knowing this history and knowing that I will continuously be fighting an uphill battle as a non-traditional transfer student has lent me the impetus to further my academic and extracurricular pursuits here at Stanford. Although this history of lynching of Mexicans is not always at the forefront of my conscience, it still pains me to know that the history is close to where I am attending school — it is subconsciously embedded into the overarching narrative of my existence here.

wildcat_arizona_2022_74,"Opinions writer Maayan Cohen sat down with three seniors, Cielo Perez (left , Olivia Monet Lee-Daily (middle and Ruby Fulford (right and got their advice for students and graduating. (Courtesy photos by Cielo Perez, Olivia Monet Lee-Daily and Ruby Fulford Three seniors just spent the last four years of their lives pursuing higher education. There have been many lessons learned and plenty of growth made. Hear from them in their own words, their feelings around graduation, their advice to new students and what lies in the next chapters of their life. Graduation is a huge accomplishment, the feelings surrounding it can be mixed with nerves, excitement or even nostalgia. Cielo Perez, 23, is graduating with a pharmaceutical science major. “I feel like a lot more excited than I thought I should be,” said Perez. Ruby Fulford, 21, is graduating with an astronomy major and three minors: physics, astrobiology and biology. “To actually graduate, I’d say I’m very excited because I’m proud of how much I have accomplished over the last four years,” said Fulford. Olivia Lee-Daily, 21, is graduating with a political science major, with an emphasis in law and public studies and a minor in Africana studies. “It’s weird — I don’t feel anything, like that sounds really bad, but I feel like it hasn’t hit me yet,” said Lee-Daily. Four years is a long time. When asked to summarize their time at UA in only a few words or phrases, the answers varied from “fast food,” said Lee-Daily, to “eye-opening,” said both Perez and Fulford. Independence, adventurous, social, passionate, challenging, growth and community were among some of the other words used to encapsulate these three seniors’ time at UA. These students have learned so much through their experiences, and they each have unique advice to share. “it’s okay to not have everything figured out. If there’s something you’re good at, just go for it, be passionate about it and help others and don’t be afraid to ask for help,” Perez said. “Don’t let yourself stress out too much. In terms of the social side of things, I would say just concentrate on finding people that you can actually be yourself around, that you actually like spending time with … keep looking for those people, and when you find them appreciate them,” Fulford said. “Enjoy every single second of your undergrad, enjoy from freshman year all the way up to the end of senior year because I promise you, four years sounds like a long time, but I genuinely feel like I started my freshman year a year ago.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_12,"Amazonworkers in Staten Island successfully voted to be a part of Amazon’s first union, Amazon Labor Union on April 1. Amazon is among a group of companies likeStarbucksthat have seen a large unionization push nationally in the past year to rally for increased wages, better training, safe working conditions and worker’s benefits. While unionizing remains an incredibly difficult task in the United States, the successes of unions at Starbucks and Amazon are a much needed change to the waning democracy of the American workplace caused by a recentdeclinein union membership during the past century. Unions are essential to a functioning democracy. Unions help maintain a balance of power between the owner of a business and workers. German philosophersKarl Marx and Friedrich Engelsargued in The Communist Manifesto that a person’s position in society is determined by their relationship to labor and the means of production; the working class must sell their work for a wage, while the production owners often have some combination of economic control over the workplace, political power and capital to invest in production. Through purely analyzing wealth and income, we are seeing the results of class — as the two only measure the differences in a person’s possessions, but not how the differences in wealth and income arerelated and created. However, Marx and Engels believed that the origins of classinequalitylie in the systemic issues that the capitalist workplace presents between the worker and owner. Unions and union contracts seek to correct the systemic imbalances that Marx and Engels identified because they give workers the ability tovoicehow they want to be treated and the conditions in which they want to work under. Business ownersaren’t fond of unions because the key to competing in our capitalist economy is to have flexibility in wages, hiring and hours. Giving into the union worker demands of higher salaries and less hours would result in lower company profits, as wages and salaries range from50 to 80%of the total of industry costs. Despite the recent successes of Starbucks and Amazon unions, there has been a decline of union membership over the past century. In1935, 35.7% of private sector workers belonged to unions compared to only 6.7% in 2015.Studieshave concluded that the decline in union membership has a direct correlation with a decline in the overall health of workers, given that union contracts provide worker benefits such as health insurance, raised wages, protection from discrimination and retirement benefits. The federal government has also increased its deployment of union-busting tactics in the pastcentury. One of the most prominent historical examples of union busting involved the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO strike in1981. President Ronald Reagan ordered all 12,000 striking PATCO members to return to work, firing those who didn’t return after 48 hours. The historical context of unionization in the U.S. further emphasizes the need to celebrate the emergence of Amazon Labor Union and Starbucks Workers United. While logistically addressing the every need of labor unions is complex, it’s undeniable that workers deserve what they’re asking for. Sydney Durkin, a 26-year-old committee member of Starbucks Workers United and Starbucks shift supervisor in Seattle expressed that unions are a civil right. “It’s a basic armor of democracy to have rights as workers and to have the ability to bargain collectively and have a voice that is equal to your bosses in such an unequal employer-employee relationship,” Durkin said in an interview with New University. Starbucks Workers Unitedis one of the most successful union movements in recent years, with over ahundred locationsaround two dozen states all across the United States. Durkin’s location was the first Starbucks in Seattle to unionize. However, it’s important to recognize that the success of Starbucks unions is a unique case on its own. Starbucks attempts to portray their company as progressive and worker friendly, which appeals to the Starbucks worker demographic that Durkin described as primarily composed of young liberal college students. “I think we have higher expectations of what our workplace should be like, so when it’s not measuring up to that expectation, it becomes the question of ‘what’s the next step?’” Durkin said to New University. To Durkin and many other workers, unions are the obvious next step. Amazon, on the other hand, has a history of being hard-line on unions, making the formation of Amazon Workers United all the more exciting. In addition to the difficulty of unionizing under largeprivateemployers,Amazonhas created explicit anti-union campaigns through negative messages and meetings. The e-commerce corporation alsospent$4.3 million just last year on anti-union consultants. According to company documents recently leaked bythe Intercept, Amazon had discussed blocking a list of words including “union,” “compensation,” “slave,” “diversity,” “grievance” and “injustice” from a company internal messaging app currently in development. This is a clear example of Amazon infringing on their workers’ freedom of speech. This abuse of power is a prime example of the imbalance of power between workers and employers that Marx and Engels pointed to. The extent to which Amazon is attempting to disrupt communication is extremely concerning and highlights our desperate need for a more democratic workplace. Labor unions are a civil right that improves the health and lives of workers and ultimately strengthens our democracy. Durkin believes that while the acceptance and success of unions will be a long process, we should remain optimistic about our future. “I think what’s happening right now are the seeds of a very important movement,” Durkin said. For Amazon Labor Union to join the recent unionization movement despite the company’s efforts to union bust is spectacular. Given the decline in union membership in the U.S., this new emergence can inspire more union formations in the future, ultimately painting a promising trajectory of establishing a more democratic work environment.

ubyssey_2022_52,"Oct. 25, 2022 Written byUbyssey Editorial Board The AMS is not practicing good governance. On Wednesday night, AMS Council is set to vote on a motion to reviseits Records Policy (SR2 that, if passed, would mean members of the AMS (a.k.a. students cannot request access to internal correspondence, transition reports or raw data (data collected by or for the AMS . Theproposed changescome afterThe Ubysseyrequested access to redacted emails from the AMS related to the hiring of AMS President Eshana Bhangu asinterim VP financeand discussions around the amendments to theVideo Surveillance Policy (SR14 that now allows filming inside Safewalk and other AMS vehicles in September. In response to the request, Bhangu and AMS Archivist Sheldon Goldfarb said email correspondences are not considered records underAMS codeandbylaws. “According to the AMS Bylaws, AMS members can access records and books. Correspondence, in the way the Bylaws currently are written, does not fall under that category,” Bhangu wrote in an emailed statement toThe Ubyssey. At the time of our request, emails seemed to be considered an AMS record — bylaw 18(1 states, “All reports, correspondence and any records … shall remain with the Society to be kept at the offices of the Society” — but it was surprising to learn that they cannot be requested by students. We also requested access to the Electoral Administrator transition report — which was rejected on similar grounds and would not be requestable under the amended Policy SR2. We understand that some documents need to remain confidential;The Ubysseyisn’t asking for records that would leave the personal information of AMS staff and members up for grabs. All we’re asking for is to be able to access redacted documents that society members should be entitled to view. These new restrictions on what documents students can access could be codified on Wednesday. Making internal correspondence and raw data unrequestable by students is bad for many reasons. Such a practice is bad for transparency — a topic that candidates in AMS elections, including the current execs, have beenpromising to address for years. The Ubysseyhas its own reasons for wanting to be able to request AMS emails: to help with our reporting and to hold student leaders accountable. But, students in general should also be able to request emails from their democratically-elected and student-funded leaders. Why can’t a student see email conversations between the VP finance and Studentcare related to coverage under the AMS/GSS Health & Dental Plan? Why can’t a student see emails between the VP academic and university affairs and a student advocacy group? Refusing to allow students to see these records also makes it harder for the AMS to call on other bodies, like UBC or theStudent LegalFund Society, to be more transparent with students. Why should people listen to calls for frankness in governance when those demanding these changes are themselves not practicing transparency? The proposed changes leave the door open for case-by-case exceptions for requesting these documents. But, the AMS is still able to leave students in the dark about what’s going on a vast majority of the time — and gives the student society an easy excuse for not sharing anything that could damage its reputation. There is a precedent for requesting emails from the AMS. In 2020,The Ubysseyreported onconflict of interest allegationsagainst then-AMS VP External Kalith Nanayakkara. When asked about this precedent, Bhangu said this “past lack of compliance with the Bylaw section has been by one individual, and it is not a norm.” Why can’t it be the norm? Part of the issue is that the AMS is a private entity. Other public institutions like UBC and the provincial government are required to release emails and correspondences when requested under theFreedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act(FIPPA . Another issue is that theBC Societies Act— the law outlining how private organizations like the AMS function — doesn’t require these groups to even comply with records requests. In this regard, the AMS is being generous. Despite this generosity, the AMS can do more — and the first step would be for councillors to vote against the revisions to Policy SR2 on Wednesday. The AMS might not fall under FIPPA, and the Societies Act might not require compliance with record requests, but that does not mean it should explicitly prevent sharing emails and data upon request. Similarly, Bhangu wrote in her statement, “We are happy to consider making exceptions in exceptional circumstances, but we must ensure compliance with our Bylaws to the best of our ability.” Yet, nothing in AMS code or bylaws explicitly prevents the sharing of emails. We urge the AMS to follow its word and commit to transparent governance by voting against these proposed changes to Policy SR2. Editorials represent the opinions of the editorial board ofThe Ubyssey.

crimson_2022_118,"Last week, as part of its annual Israeli Apartheid Week, The Harvard Palestinian Solidarity Committee mounted anartistic displaybetween Thayer Hall and the Science Center Plaza promoting awareness of the immense suffering that Palestinians experience under Israel’s military occupation. Beneath the 12 paintings ran the messages “Free Palestine” and “Boycott, Divest, Sanction,” prompting the resurgence of a heated conversation about Zionism and antisemitism on college campuses. Although the IAW display is no longer up, the same broadly-sweeping, aggressive talking points that characterize this conversation still echo around campus. Pro-Palestinian activists construct Israel as a malicious villain whose sole mission is to keep Palestinians in squalor, pulling out politically-loaded words like “genocide” and “Apartheid” from their inventory. Those quick to rush to Israel’s defense proclaim it as “the only true democracy in the Middle East” and immediately resort to disparaging the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, the condescending subtext of which regards the Palestinian people as unfit to govern themselves. Yet it is not only the extremes that continue, year after year, to use the same talking points well after their potential to prompt productive dialogue has been exhausted. I tire, too, of having to hear the more “moderate” response that one can “criticize the Israeli government without rejecting the state itself.” Beyond carelessly disregarding the not-so-clear distinction between a state — especially one that purports to be a democracy — and its government, the issues in Israel run far deeper than the government that presently happens to be in power. The recent history of the modern state of Israel has, irrespective of its government, been inextricably linked with the oppression of the Palestinian people. Though this is not necessarily inherent to the abstract notion of the state itself, such subjugation has characterized the Israeli state in reality. Since 1967, the West Bank has been under military occupation, a legal status that grants Israel functional control over the area while circumventing the obligation to grant Palestinians Israeli citizenship and the rights and privileges this designation would afford. After 50-plus years, I question whether “occupation,” a word which suggests transience, is even apt. Accordingly, I don’t find it unreasonable that activists — or anyone concerned with justice, for that matter — would be morally outraged by the situation in Palestine. And I certainly don’t find it unreasonable to direct that outrage at something more fundamental than “the Israeli government.” But our language matters — both out of respect for all parties involved and for the credibility of the person or organization expressing a political message. The way we go about discussing sensitive political topics, no matter the emotional fire they may stir up, therefore deserves careful scrutiny. The Palestine Solidarity Committee’s display in the Yard says, “Zionism is racism, settler colonialism, white supremacy, and apartheid.” Putting aside the fact that “Zionism” is such a poorly-defined term that I’m not sure I really know what it even refers to anymore, it is these last two accusations that bother me most. To accuse Israel of white supremacy is to ignore over half of the Israeli population of Mizrahi, Ethiopian, and mixed Jews for whom “white” remains a mischaracterization. It also ignores the fact that, until recently, whiteness was a category that all Jews were decidedly excluded from. I am Jewish, and given the shifting nature of whiteness, I acknowledge that I am also white, but I would be lying if I said it didn’t make me at all uncomfortable for accusations of white supremacy to be levied at Jews both alike and unalike me, whose shared history as victims of genocidal white supremacy remains fresh in our collective memory. To accuse Israel of “Apartheid” in a colloquial sense — although recognizing that the term does have a technical definition under international law — is really to accuse Israel of perpetrating the same injustices of Apartheid South Africa. I understand that calling Israel an Apartheid state is meant to use the unambiguous injustice of South Africa as a frame of reference to convince people of egregious Israeli injustices and is not meant to posit a precise, one-to-one correspondence between Israel and South Africa. But Apartheid South Africa was a state where miscegenation was illegal and the law, which was directly derived from eugenics, regarded people of color as inferior explicitly and exclusively by virtue of their race. No law in Israel prohibits sex across racial lines, and though terrible discrimination absolutely exists in the state, it is not founded in racist notions of biological superiority. These are, I think, crucial distinctions to be made, lest we view Israel through a lens that incorrectly asseses the country’s history, making concepts associated with Apartheid seem more applicable than they really are. Emotionally charged and inflammatory language like this succeeds in, justifiably, elevating the perceptual stakes of the issue at hand, but it conceals something important along the way: Something doesn’t have to be white supremacy or Apartheid for it to be bad. And what is happening in Israel, what has been happening in Israel for over 50 years, is really, really bad. Using phrases like “white supremacy” and “Apartheid,” however, cheapen the semantic weight these words legitimately hold and unfortunately misrepresent the unique complexities and conditions of today’s conflict. Aside from sacrificing honesty for the sake of provocation, these words alienate students who, like me, are genuinely upset about and disillusioned by Israel’s decades-long disenfranchisement, displacement, and oppression of the Palestinian people. I hate to get caught up in semantics, but with conversations that hit close to home, the words we use really do matter. Sam P. N. Libenson ’25 lives in Weld Hall."
thetech_mit_2022_38,"We write to draw attention to the appalling conditions of degradation and helplessness that have befallen a member of the MIT community in Egypt. Our hope is that some members of the Institute will be motivated to join a campaign to save Seif Fateen and redress the cruel injustices that he has endured for more than three years. Seif Fateen completed his PhD at MIT in 2002. He lived and worked in the U.S., where three of his seven children were born, until 2005. On his return to Egypt, he took up a faculty position at Cairo University, and from 2009 until his arrest in 2018, he regularly posted educational videos to his YouTube channel, including apopular series on thermodynamics for chemical engineers. In 2012, he became Assistant to the Minister of Higher Education, a short-lived tenure that was brought to an abrupt end in July 2013 by the military coup that toppled President Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood organization. The July 2013 coup was led by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, former field marshall and chief of military intelligence of the Egyptian army, against the nascent Egyptian democracy less than three years after the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. Fateen’s function in the Ministry of Higher Education under Morsi, together with his association with former parliamentarians when Morsi was president, seems to have been his crime in the eyes of the Egyptian security services. In November 2018, security officers affiliated with the Interior Ministry raided Fateen’s home, confiscating laptops, mobile phones, and books. He was arrested without a warrant, taken blindfolded to an unknown detention center, and forcibly disappeared for more than nine months; his family knew nothing of his whereabouts or whether he was even alive. In coordination with Fateen’s daughter Rahma, currently a college student in Norway, theFreedom Initiative, a D.C.-based human rights organization, first alerted the public to Fateen’s case in March of this year. They reported that Fateen had been subjected to torture and mistreatment, including beating, electric shocks to the genitalia, and prolonged periods during which he was blindfolded and handcuffed to a pipe in the wall. He was eventually moved to the Qanater prison complex in September 2019 and has been held there since. He is now confined to his cell, which he shares with over 20 other inmates, for at least 22 hours a day. He is allowed visits by a single family member once per month and is prevented from receiving books, warm clothes, or medicine. Alan Hatton, who was Fateen’s PhD advisor at MIT in the late 1990s and early 2000s, was shocked to hear of his former student’s confinement and the severity of his treatment in Cairo, recalling that Seif was one of the kindest and most honorable students he has had the pleasure of working with — someone who cared deeply for his family, his country, and his religion, and who was a highly-regarded academic in Egypt. It is truly unfortunate that his service to education in Egypt during the short Morsi governance should have resulted in such brutal treatment by the Sisi regime. While Seif Fateen is only one man caught in the web of a sprawling complex of prisons, his torment epitomizes the scourge of ruthless repression that countless Egyptians have had to suffer since the July 2013 coup, when Sisi unleashed a police state far more repressive than the government of his autocratic predecessor Hosni Mubarak — an assessmentU.S. congressional researchers confirm. After more than three years of waiting for a reprieve from anotoriously erratic judicial system, Fateen is one of very few incarcerated Egyptians with international contacts. It is a matter of great courage for his family to risk retaliation by bringing his case to public attention. On Sisi’s watch, Egypt s security agencies haveindiscriminately jailedcritics, human rights defenders, and public figures across the political spectrum, from leftists to Islamists. They have acted with no restraint, brazenly cranking up repression so that not even the faintest whispers of opposition to Sisi s policies can persist. And this has happened with unflinching American support. For decades now, thetop two recipients of the U.S. Foreign Military Financing (FMF programhave been Israel (about $3.1 billion annually and Egypt (about $1.3 billion annually , and together they account for about75% of the total annual FMF. The numbers from advocacy groups includingHuman Rights WatchandAmnesty Internationaltell a grim story for those who fall prey to Egypt’s security apparatus. TheEgyptian Initiative for Personal Rightsreportsthat “torture and ill-treatment have become systematic in Egypt’s prisons, and security services enjoy impunity when treating detainees inhumanely.” This assessment is corroborated by an extensive documentation in areportfrom the State Department, which also mentions on page eight that the total prison population is currently estimated “at more than 119,000 located in an estimated 78 prisons, including approximately 82,000 convicted prisoners and 37,000 pretrial detainees. Although President Joe Biden is in thehabit of assertingthat “human rights are at the core of U.S. foreign policy,” he has never called out the Sisi regime for itspoliciesof “extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, mass trials, mass death sentences, torture, and systematic intimidation of media workers.” In fact, in a meeting with the Egyptian president July 16,Biden declaredthat he is “looking forward to working with Sisi on a whole range of issues,” none of which included the Egyptian government’s brutal abuse of political prisoners. Perhaps more diplomatic, but no less deceitful, Secretary of State Antony Blinken hasinvoked“the totality of our interests” to explain delays of action on human rights. It is high time to challenge the Biden administration and its spokespeople: How is “the totality of our interests” undermined by demanding the release of a single innocent human being, Seif Fateen — a defenseless professor of chemical engineering arbitrarily detained in Egypt?

ubyssey_2022_3,"Sept. 27, 2022 Written byAquila UnderwoodandJulianna Yue WhenThe Ubysseyapproached us with the idea of a Truth and Reconciliation supplement for their late September issue, there was no hesitation when we said yes. We know that Indigenous voices are far and few in today’s media. We started writing forThe Ubyssey’s Indigenous column,NDNs at UBC, in October of last year. As we took classes and wrote articles together we became close, making our partnership in the role of guest editors even stronger. In the past we have written individual pieces, as well as a collaborative zine on navigating postcolonial realities. Through this, we realized that now, more than ever, we are seeing the reemergence of Indigenous ways of life, a rekindling of sorts. Thus, when we were pitched the idea of this supplement we were immediately drawn back to this idea. Rekindling our cultures with our communities and cousins is an attempt to decolonize and bring back our old ways. With the hope of contributing to this rekindling, we assembled a guiding pitch list with a range of topics, calling for written and visual submissions from Indigenous students for this supplement. In doing this, we hope that this supplement shines light on Indigenous resistance, resilience and excellence and shows the current rekindling of Indigenous culture taking place in so-called “Canada.

stanforddaily_2022_36,"“Congratulations. You have been admitted to Stanford University’s Class of 2025!” I think every Stanford student will remember the moment they read those words for the rest of their lives. On April 7th, 2021, at around 3:30 pm, I assigned my younger sister the task of clicking the “status update” and reporting back to me, because no one else in my family could bear to do it. I remember curling myself up into a ball and squeezing my eyes shut. I remember the long, agonizing pause as the clock slowly turned to 4pm. And then, I remember the shrieking. Not long after this, I remember receiving emails from Stanford inviting me to something called “Cardinal Quad,” sending me links to forms to fill out and imparting instructions and next steps. My inbox quickly became saturated with emails titled “Approaching Stanford,” emails that were so lengthy and dense that if they were a required reading, I would glance at the first few words and call it a day. I remember attempting to sort through the 34 “Quick Links” that were listed at the bottom of every email, and trying to differentiate between the many acronyms, such as COLLEGE and ITALIC, WAYS, ESF, and SLE (I still couldn’t tell you the difference between some of them . Most of all, I recall feeling like every incoming newsletter was a puzzle that required days — or weeks — to solve, and being lost, confused, and overwhelmed. As I scrambled to fill out forms, write essays, and make sense of the acronyms and course requirements, I felt as if this was the final exam that would determine if I was truly worthy of this institution. When I was accepted to another university, my family and I received a singular email that offered congratulations and invited us to join one general “Welcome!” Zoom meeting. I joined the meeting, obtained the necessary information, and felt wanted at that university while simultaneously feeling on top of what I needed to know. Upon being accepted to Stanford, however, my inbox became deluged with Zoom links to dozens of welcome meetings. Overwhelmed by the array of choices and unable to keep track of all the options, I did not attend a single meeting. Ultimately, I walked away with less information about Stanford than I did about the other university. When presented with an overabundance of options, a common human response is to freeze, paralyzed by the array of choices. Sometimes, the way to help more is to do less. The “Approaching Stanford” emails are messy and disorganized, lacking a “Table of Contents” and rambling on about many topics that could easily have been left out. If these emails were an RBA, I would give them a poor grade based purely on a lack of fundamental knowledge about writing; namely, the importance of conciseness, formatting, and structure. For example, the August 26, 2021 edition of the newsletter contains a paragraph that says: “We have been getting a lot of questions about the placement exams and diagnostics for Chemistry, Math, Physics, and Language, so this is a good opportunity to remind you about them. First, you are not required to take them. For example, Stanford doesn’t have a general math requirement for all students. Classes in these departments are wonderful and engaging, but there are numerous ways to fill the Ways breadth requirements. However, for some courses, to take your first Stanford class in that subject, you do have to take the placement diagnostics or exams. These placements are needed to give you guidance as to which class you are best positioned to succeed in. So if you are considering any of those courses, we encourage you to take the placements as soon as possible.” While the conversational tone has its merits, these 7 sentences could have been condensed into one: “Placement exams are only required if you plan to take a chemistry, math, physics, or language course.” These 7 sentences are hard to read, difficult to make sense of, and clog up the emails, covering up other important information. Besides just being frustrating for incoming students, the complexity of these emails creates several other repercussions. For much of its existence, Stanford’s student body has resembled what you’d expect of an elite educational institution: white, wealthy, and well-connected. Even though the demographics of its student body have shifted slightly over recent years, and Stanford has begun to vocalize its commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion more loudly, the transition to Stanford for a low-income student or a student from a historically marginalized group will inevitably still be more difficult than for those from more privileged groups. And while the obstacles that these emails present might not be difficult to navigate for an incoming student with parents or friends who attended Stanford, or a community with the resources to assist them through the process, it is the students without these resources who will struggle the most. And while most of us ultimately make it to the other side, these emails may have planted the question of “do I belong here?”, which will ring louder for some than others. So Stanford, do better. Your d.school classes teach that the first step towards making something welcoming is accessibility. And the first step towards accessibility is simplification. Just like you showed us with your application questions, it is harder to write in fewer words than more. True intellect is not measured by how many fancy words and acronyms you can throw in, it is measured by how efficiently you can communicate an idea. I don’t mean to sound ungrateful; I am extremely appreciative of the effort that this university is making to provide us with opportunities and knowledge. I simply hope that by improving the “Approaching Stanford” emails and making them more concise and organized, we can make these opportunities and knowledge even more accessible.

rice_thresher_2022_19,"ByPaul Mayer9/20/22 11:44pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. In the 18th Century, Immanuel Kant (often consideredthe central figurein modern philosophy used the phraseSpaere audein a 1784 essay titled “Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment.” Translated from Latin, it means “dare to know,” or in some cases, “dare to be wise.” Kant argued our inability to think for ourselves was due to fear, not due to a lack of intellect. In the opening paragraph of his essay, Kant states “Have the courage to use your own reason—that is the motto of enlightenment.” Have you ever been afraid to ask a question or participate in a discussion, inside or outside the classroom, out of fear? I know I have. Ironically, my fear of appearing uneducated or uninformed was holding me back frombecominginformed. I was so caught up in avoiding ridicule or making a mistake that I became a passive observer in my education instead of taking an active role. And I’m not alone: as David Getterwrotefrom his experience, “Students have withdrawn from discussions to which they might otherwise meaningfully contribute and suppressed their views for the sake of maintaining their standing.” Furthermore, several of my friends and classmates lament that they can only discuss certain topics in the safety of a classroom. When we stop engaging and asking questions, we prioritize our own comfort over our intellectual development. Instead, as Rice’s new campaign encourages, we should “Be Bold” and cast ourselves into the learning process. Of course, none of this occurs in a vacuum, and I am concerned that in our current landscape ofincreasedpolitical polarization, there is now more at stake than just being wrong. By expressing an idea or engaging in the learning process, we may fear being judged, losing our friends and even verbal and physical harassment. For example, a recent trending post on Fizz had multiple comments encouraging the poster to dox their classmate due to their controversial views on sexual assault. Silencing perspectives using shame or fear is ineffective at changing or opening minds and antithetical to the academic freedom integral to the university (See Rice’spolicy . Furthermore, Rice’s facultyhandbookaffirms, “Where people hesitate to speak their mind, critical thinking has no purchase, and the university cannot even begin to carry out its mission.” Maintaining a diverse learning environment is not an easy task. It requires a confidence in the efficacy of reason over manipulation: that the dialectic method of considering diverse viewpoints and experiences can help us arrive at truth. And finally, it requires the humility that we may be wrong ourselves. But to me, there is value in learning how to listen, engage with and argue against ideas, even those we think are harmful. Perhaps wisdom isn t so much about the state of being right as it is the process of engaging with others and asking the right questions. With that being said, the way we express our ideas and the language we choose can impact others, so I believe we should also do our best to be charitable and kind when interacting with our peers. Working together, we can create a culture where we are not afraid to think for ourselves by embracing opportunities to make mistakes, learning from them and celebrating our peers when they do the same. We can normalize the process of improvement by admitting when we have changed our minds, been wrong or done poorly on an assignment or exam. In classroom discussions, students and faculty can welcome different viewpoints and perspectives, even if they do not agree with them. Offering kindness and respect towards classmates and peers can help them overcome their fear of participating in a discussion. Furthermore, we don’t have to agree with everything someone believes to be friends with them. Lastly, we can practice being kind to ourselves when we are wrong or make a mistake. I strongly believe we should make the most of the valuable but limited time we share with our fellow students and professors. I challenge my fellow Owls and myself: dare to be wise. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month.

wildcat_arizona_2022_23,"The cover of “The Memory Index” by Julian R. Vaca. “I am not fine. As long as these haunting, unwieldy visions throttle me, how can I be?” Freya Izquierdo is not a normal high school girl. She is a degen, a type of person who needs artificial help to access memories she should rightfully have. In an alternate 1987, Freya isn’t the only one who can’t access her memories. The world has been at the mercy of a plague that steals human memories so that everyone, even the lucky few who still have access to most of their mind, must use artificial recall. Facing this terrible reality, Freya does the best she can to move forward while trying to reconstruct the truth of her father’s death. Yet, her life is turned upside down when the dean of Foxtail Academy recruits her to join its rank of students. Freya is suspicious — she is the only degen at the school full of kids who can recall their memories with less artificial recall than she — but she attends the school anyway, quickly discovering a group of friends who help to guide her through. When the students at Foxtail begin to disappear, Freya and her friends will have to rely on more than just their memories to discover the truth of their existence. “The Memory Index” is unlike any book I’ve read. Creating a unique blend of dystopia, sci-fi and historical fiction, this book brings readers a fresh story that tastes a little something like “The Maze Runner,” the smash hit book and movie series that was first released in2009. The historical setting and throwback to a dystopian genre not in style for the last decade helps to keep Julian R. Vaca’s YA fiction debut firmly rooted in the past: right where it needs to be. What’s great about this book is that memory, and how it haunts us, is investigated at every turn. Vaca isn’t afraid to be introspective; Freya cannot escape her past and the blurred, half-formed memories that linger in her mind. While I was reading, I was uncomfortably aware of the real-world implication of this book. In a reality so heavily guided by technology and artificial intelligence, how many memories are actually our own? How much does memory make of us? Vaca poses these questions for both his characters and readers. RELATED:REVIEW: ‘Dance Theatre of Harlem’ in Centennial Hall For a story intended for a young adult audience, Vaca gives his readers material beyond gossip, smartphones and petty high school drama. Vaca treats his young audience with respect, as though they have the capabilities to face such ethical dilemmas because they do. In a genre that is so saturated with muted stories imitating the truth of teenage life, I appreciated that Vaca doesn’t hesitate to ask the big questions in this book. He knows his teenage readers will one day be grappling with their own memories and the ghosts that may or may not float through their heads. He asks that readers do not look away, that they confront their past so that they may one day move beyond it, a strong lesson for more than just the characters in “The Memory Index.” *Editor’s Note: All opinions expressed in this review are held by the writer only and are not shared by the Daily Wildcat.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_45,"Public transportation fares are making acomebackin Los Angeles after being eliminated in March of 2020. Now, two years into the pandemic, residents are still struggling, especially withrising prices,goods shortagesandwage fightsacross the nation. Free or fare-reduced public transportation is necessary now more than ever. The United States needs to shift from a car-dependent society towards public transportation, both to help those in our communities and aid against climate change affecting our planet. Public transportation benefits everyone — not just working class, low-income communities who often make up themajorityof riders. Compared to automobiles,public transportationreduces air pollution and traffic congestion. According to theAmerican Public Transportation Association (APTA , just a single commuter switching from a private vehicle to public transportation can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 pounds a day, or 4,800 pounds a year. Public transportation is also a relatively cheaper option for both individuals and communities. In a report published byThe Future Is Public Transport, investing in public transportation could create 4.6 million new jobs by 2030, creating an influx in jobs for communities that need it. But fewer and fewer Americans use public transportation consistently. Since 1990,bus ridershiphas decreased by 17%. More and more people are choosing to purchase multiple vehicles rather than using the public transit systems that are readily available. Public transportation is integral to thousands of LA residents. However, ridership has been on the decline for years, despite the city’s increase in funding to improve the system. Why is public transportation decreasing in popularity? As America at large tends to favor cars, public transportation systems often inherit astigmathat categorizes them as “unsafe,” “slow” and “inconvenient.” But the real issues lie in American infrastructure and local governance. In many cities like LA, the landscape favors a car-centric model rather than one that relies on public transportation, resulting in insufficient public transit systems, regardless of how necessary they are for working class communities. Riders frequently deal with concerns about safety, a lack of reliable information such as arrival times, how extensive routes reach within the city, and simply how to use public transit. LA as well as other cities that prioritize cars over public transportation need to take these issues into consideration if they want public transportation to flourish.Concerns over crimeare especially rampant in New York City, with 90% of subway riders in a survey citing safety as important in their decision of returning to riding. As a result, the mayor of NYCannouncedan increase in patrolling. While this is a viable solution,over-policing, especially in communities predominantly made up of people of color, may pose additional safety issues. For an increase in patrolling to work, a fine line must be drawn between protecting public safety and over-policing. The lack of reliable transit information can be solved if cities make public transformation information easilyaccessible, whether by providing information in a multitude of languages or improving technology to adequately reflect accurate, up-to-date travel information. LA has been making initiatives such as theirLIFEandDASHprograms, which incentivize low-income residents and students to utilize public transportation. Reducing fares could significantly encourage residents to make use of their local public transportation systems. For public transportation to work efficiently nationwide, more cities need to follow suit. While it’s ultimately up to local governments to put in the work on public transit systems, residents themselves can also make small changes to support public transportation. Simply choosing buses, subway systems or trains over cars during more suitable commutes is one way we can contribute. If governments and citizens can take the initiative to prioritize public transportation in American society, it can gradually replace means of car transportation, promoting an environmentally cleaner and more efficient way of traveling.

rice_thresher_2022_3,"ByThresher Editorial Board11/15/22 10:16pm For the first time since 2019, Rice is not allowing undergraduate students to remain in their on-campus housing during winter break. While this is a disappointing development, we understand why this decision needed to be made. Like students, staff need a break after a long semester. Further, keeping students on campus by providing housing over break was originally implemented to address pandemic travel restrictions, which are mostly gone. However, the need for winter housing is not gone. This decision still leaves some international students — or any other on-campus student looking to remain in Houston — scrambling for housing. Recently, Lovett College came up with a solution to this problem that still gives staff the break they deserve. Their college coordinator and off-campus representatives have reached out to other off-campus students about subletting to students searching for housing while they’re gone during break. This not only solves the initial problem, but also gives off-campus students a chance to recover some of the rent that would otherwise be wasted. It’s a win for everyone involved. We want to encourage all residential colleges, and all off-campus students, to follow Lovett’s lead. For one thing, isn’t this the core purpose of the residential college system, to provide community support in sustainable ways that benefit us all? And if being a good person isn’t reason enough to let a student in need crash in your off-campus room for a few weeks, consider this: It will be the easiest bag you’ve ever made. This also stands as a reminder to all of us that there are many resources we take for granted, in this case an empty room over break, that can help support our fellow students. We honestly aren’t sure we’ve ever come across a better or easier solution to a problem. Genuinely, the editorial board is struggling to write more than 300 words, because it is so obviously a good idea. So, shoutout to Lovett for coming up with this idea, and we hope to see it implemented campus-wide.

stanforddaily_2022_20,"For the cost of $25.99 on Amazon, you can be a Playboy Bunny this Halloween! The costume includes Polyester Bunny ears, a pink corset with snap closure and more. Maybe you’ll invite a male friend to wear a faux velvety robe and don the infamous Hugh M. Hefner sailor cap for just $44.99. If you and your friends are opting last minute for Hefner and his bunnies, I would advise you to think twice. The costumes are emblematic of a company that profited off of women’s bodies through the disguise of “sexual liberation.” The company’s ringleader, referred to as “Hef,” was a larger-than-life man who set out to manufacture America’s finest utopia. The operation, which aims to satisfy men’s urges, monopolizes American lives in the form of print, film and an immersive adult playground known as the Playboy Mansion. The history of Hugh Hefner and “Playboy’s” regard for gender is oftentimes incongruous. Hefner and “Playboy” rose to prominence in apostwar1950s “crisis of masculinity.” Although the time period heralded anti-feminist sentiment, Hugh Hefner claimed the magazine’s feminist origins byinsistingthat the playmates, models featured in the magazine’s centerfold, “fulfill their own needs and desires” while satisfying men. Hefner frequently made sexist remarks inconsistent with the magazine’s public statements in support of women’s rights. Hefner’s biographer Steven Wattswrotethat he asserted “no sane woman would really want equality,” yet in 1970, the company spoke in support of access to contraceptives and abortion. “Playboy” has also been critiqued for seeking legitimation from the academic world. In refusal of being a pornographic publication, the magazine includes interviews, music focuses, philosophy highlights and life guides. The intellectual materials in the magazine at times trivialize its pornographic aspects; young boys who are unsure how to approach manhood use “Playboy” as an ideological manual. Instead of allowing a natural pattern of male growth, Hefner established aquasi-monopolyover coming of age in America. Generations of women have pledged to unlock the secrets behind “Playboy.” Alexandra Dean, the Emmy award-winning filmmaker who directed A&E’s “Secrets of Playboy” (2022 , wanted to capture the relevance and vibrancy of “Playboy” through film. During her research process, she instead discovered Hefner’s friendships with sexual predatorsBill Cosby and Roman Polanksiand realized it was time for the empire’s reckoning. She redirected the show to answer the question: what is the history of “Playboy” from the women’s perspective? The “Secrets of Playboy” series tells the story of a prominent Bunny and seven-year girlfriend of Hefner, Holly Madison. Madison was first attracted by the magazine’s allure and the prospect of making college tuition money. She confessed that Hefner kept his dynasty intact through blackmail, intimidation and assertion of power over the Bunnies. With the history of “Playboy” in mind, wearing the Bunny costume has more significant implications than just sex appeal. The costume began as a choice for women but soon became a mental and physical prison. Corsets shaped the playmates’ bodies into hourglass form while Hefner subjugated their brains. Wearing the Bunny costume meant initiation into a cult of enchantment and trauma. In the third episode, “The Bunnies & The Cleanup Crew,” interviewees describe the coverup of horrors that occurred in the mansion. Sondra Theodore, who referred to herself as Hefner’s drug mule and girlfriend, told a story of two new Bunnies who went missing from the “Playboy” club for three days. They had been kidnapped and sodomized by a VIP of the company. The women were never permitted to go to the hospital or call the police, even in situations of extreme danger. “Playboy’s” logo exists on tracksuits and dorm room posters as an emblem of fame, glamor and masculine ideals. While the classic bunny stamp is relevant in today’s y2k fashion resurgence, the magazine itself has lost traction. As a last-ditch effort to save the company’s reputation and monetary value, “Playboy” is making strides toward diversity and inclusion. The attempt to turn “Playboy” into a woman-led, pleasure-focused magazine does not excuse its sexist history. While Hefner was not properly held accountable for his actions in his lifetime, stories of abuse have been given attention since his death in 2017. The college culture of Halloween as an opportunity to look sexually attractive is deeply damaging. Boys dress up as Hugh Hefner to feel suave and macho. Girls wear Bunny costumes to display their bodies. Not only does the Bunny evoke years ofabuse, but dressing as Hefner also positions men as exploitative and aggressive. While rabbit tails and sailor caps seem alluring, “Playboy” cosplay glamorizes a culture of assault and extortion."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_53,"Editor’s Note: This article includes an interview with former UCI professor Dr. Aaron Kheriaty conducted on Nov. 21, roughly three weeks prior to his termination. The University of California’s current COVID-19vaccine policymandated full vaccinations for university members before the start of fall quarter 2021. This mandate included students, trainees, personnel and any other person who works, lives or learns at the university’s locations. A student could request vaccine exemption if they reported having a disability, medical reason or religious objection. More recently, the UC have also required all members to upload proof of a booster shot by Jan. 31. When the health of the people around you is endangered, the only consideration a person should have is prioritizing the health of the community. A community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease; a person’s religious ideology should not be held above the health of others. Vaccination policy is historically one of the most effective public health interventions in the world for saving lives. InBruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, Justice Antonin Scalia stated that “the elimination of communicable diseases through vaccination became one of the greatest achievements of public health in the 20th century.” In August 2021, former UCI psychiatry associate professor and Medical Ethics Program Director Dr. Aaron Kheriaty sued the university because he believed that their vaccine policy failed to acknowledge people like himself who have immunity from previous COVID-19 infection. However, Kheriaty also supports all COVID-19 vaccination exemptions, including religious exemptions. In ablog postposted on Dec. 17, Kheriaty shared that he was fired from UCI for his refusal of vaccination. Like most people who support COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions, Kheriaty believes that religious exemptions are protected under the First Amendment. He assesses whether a vaccine mandate should or shouldn’t challenge the free exercise of religion by analyzing “the circumstances and the empirical realities at work.” “One of the problems with our pandemic response and with COVID-19 is that there are a lot of built-in assumptions that people have about this virus and about vaccines based on prior experience with vaccines that they’re projecting onto the COVID-19 situation that don’t necessarily apply,” ​​​​Kheriaty said. Kheriaty states that there isn’t a strong enough case to challenge religious exemptions because the current COVID-19 vaccines don’t have sterilizing immunity — meaning they not only diminish the risk of severe illness but also prevent infections and transmission to other people. “The free exercise of religion is a First Amendment right, and I think it’s a natural right,” Kheriaty said. “It doesn’t mean that the free exercise of religion always trumps every other interest or public good, and that is not how the First Amendment is interpreted in our country … If we had a sterilizing immunity vaccine, then the common good or the social good argument would have a lot more force for the vaccines.” While Kheriaty is correct that the COVID-19 vaccine cannot prevent all transmissions, the vaccine’s reduction of symptom severity significantly decreases the ability to infect others. Unvaccinated individuals on the other hand — especially those who, unlike Kheriaty, don’t have “recovered immunity” — generally have significantly higher transmission rates. Even Kheriaty’s “recovered immunity” argument is being called into question due torecent evidencethat the Delta variant antibodies, likely what Kheriaty had, will be less protective against the Omicron variant. In any respect, unvaccinated people without immunity endanger the health of everyone — not just the immunosuppressed or medically exempt people but also those who are vaccinated. The debate is whether religious exemptions pose a great enough danger to the general public that it should take precedence over the First Amendment, and it’s clear fromscientific datathat any unvaccinated person without immunity does pose a significant danger. Therefore, the First Amendment isn’t quite compelling enough to grant religious exemptions. Another legal aspect that supports religious exemption isTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act. Currently used to offer protection for workers declining vaccination due to religious beliefs, this law was created in an attempt to respect the beliefs of and protect religious people from extreme discrimination such as forced work on a religious holiday or forced removal of a religious clothing item. Nowhere does this act imply that protection extends so far as to hold someone’s religious belief above the common or social good. While it remains important to not discriminate against someone’s religious, ideological or philosophical beliefs, those individual’s beliefs have no place in dictating a system or the wellbeing of other people who don’t share those same beliefs. The standard is that the government should not deny someone their freedom to exercise religion unless there is acompellingenough reason to do so. While the Supreme Court has never made clear what constitutes a “compelling reason,” protecting the community’s overall health seems like it should be one of them. Title VII requires businesses to “reasonably accommodate the religious beliefs or practices of employees or applicants unless doing so would impose an undue hardship upon the agency.” The Supreme Court hasinterpreted “undue hardship”to mean anything more than a minimal expense. According to an interpretation by University of Virginia’s School of Lawprofessor Douglas Laycock, this would imply that employers are not required to allow religious exemption from immunizations. The fact that the Supreme Court has made these interpretations makes the case against religious exemptions that much more convincing; however, regardless of what’s understood at the federal level, vaccine mandates are unfortunately still decided by the state. Most states explicitly authorize student religious or philosophical exemptions. Despite California beingone of five statesthat doesn’t, the University of California school system still grants religious exemptions. “It’s not because the university thinks that the religious reason for not taking the vaccine is more compelling than medical reason,” Kheriaty said. “I think the university would deny religious exemptions more aggressively if it could, but it knows that then it would have to answer much harder questions in court … Lawyers don’t want to get into legal battles over the sincerity of their religious convictions or centrality of your religious convictions to your life or identity.” Unfortunately, this creates a loophole to get out of the vaccination requirement. The UC system should not be basing their health policies on the fear of legal battles. What makes the situation of religious exemptions worse is that the majority of religious exemptions have been falsely claimed, according to asurveyconducted by UC Hastings law professor Dorit Reiss. Exploitation of religious exemptions has only increased since the pandemic began. The fear UC health officials have of challenging the First Amendment and Title VII has not only allowed dangerous populations of unvaccinated people to roam around campuses, but it also has inadvertently invited this population to grow even larger by creating the option for people to falsely affiliate with a religious objection in order to avoid vaccine mandate compliance. For years, anti-vaccine websites and forums have even admitted to these levels of exploitation of religious exemptions. “So can people abuse the religious exemption claim? Yes they can. Can they claim to hold beliefs that are a pretense for what is really a medical reason or personal beliefs kind of reason for not wanting the vaccine? Yes,” Kheriaty said. While religious exemptions are a complicated legal terrain, it’s evident that the danger unvaccinated people without immunity pose to the greater health of the public should override any interpretation from the First Amendment or Title VII that an individual’s personal religious freedom should trump public wellbeing. Those legal rights protect religious beliefs, not suggest their importance is above everything else. With California already being one of the only states in the country that doesn’t explicitly authorize religious exemption for immunizations, the UC system needs to take that extra step to protect their universities by refusing religious exemptions for COVID-19 vaccines. The protection of public health should always come first.Erika Cao is an Opinion Staff Writer. She can be reached atcaoea@uci.edu."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_0,"Philadelphia rapper Lil Uzi Vert changed their pronouns in their Instagram bio to they/them on July 16th, signaling that they identify asnon-binary: “n either male n or female.” While some fans praised Lil Uzi Vert for coming out, other fansthreatenedthem to change their pronouns back to he/him or risk losing their fans’ loyalty. Lil Uzi Vert’s problematic past has also re-entered public scrutiny — in February, theypleaded no contestafter being accused of assaulting their ex-girlfriend, Brittany Byrd. Lil Uzi Vert has not made a public statement regarding the change, but they responded to aTweetposted by rapper Yeat with “Yo yeat” when Yeat tweeted “Yo they.” Ironically, Lil Uzi Vert’s controversial past includes transphobia. In their 2019 single “That’s a Rack,” Lil Uzi Vert rapped “I was checkin’ my DMs, found out she was a man/ I can’t DM never, ever again/ Lucien on my vision, that’s the only thing that’s tran.” Lil Uzi Vert’s transphobic lyrics were shocking, as they have previously shown support to the LGBTQ+ community by wearingrainbow flag apparelon Instagram and wearingwomen’s clothing. Lil Uzi Vert’s past transphobia and their newly revealed gender identity leave people scratching their heads as to whether their identity should be embraced or questioned, but their transphobic history does not give us the right to disrespect them by dismissing their pronouns. In Lil Uzi Vert’s case, we should separate their identity from their beliefs and actions and validate their new identity. It is often difficult to conclude whether one’s identity can be separated from their past mistakes and personal beliefs. Actions speak louder than words and expose one’s true colors, but harmful actions from those under the LGBTQ+ umbrella are often used toinvalidatetheir identities. Yet other groups’ identities are never questioned in the face of one member’s wrongdoings. For example, politically active pro-life men are still regarded as men. In this instance, their actions of attending anti-abortion rallies and belief that abortions result in the intentional killing of human beings negatively influence our perception of them because they fail to consider women’s bodily autonomy and the health ramifications that childbirth imposes upon vulnerable women, but their identity is always respected. Many people refuse to use someone’s correct pronouns and cast them off as illogical, unnecessary, and confusing, which invalidates many LGBTQ+ members’ identities. In reality, it isgrammatically correctand a simple sign of respect. Elon Muskstatedthat he supports the LGBTQ+ community, yet calls all pronouns “an esthetic nightmare,” leading his transgender biological child todisassociate herselffrom him. When singer Demi Lovato came out as non-binary, American conservative Candace Owens spread insulting misinformation about non-binary gender identities by posting a hatefulTweetsaying that “Announcing your pronouns are they/them is just poor grammar. I don’t care your reasons — please stop trying to make low academic achievement a thing.” After Sam Smith came out as non-binary, they wereexcludedfrom gendered categories at the 2021 Brit Awards. English television personality Piers Morgan thenbrandednon-binary gender identities as a “fad” and “an excuse for people to be different.” He also falselyaccusedSmith of using their pronouns as a publicity stunt to promote the success of their upcoming album. When it comes to navigating identity inliterature and media, gender identity is often associated with sexual orientation by grouping transgender people under the LGBTQ+ umbrella, generalizing the entire LGBTQ+ community in one set of experiences. The lack of a popular label like TGNC (transgender and gender non-conforming deprives the transgender community of necessary inclusion into society. It is clear that the LGBTQ+ community continues to struggle with being accepted, which is why some may perceive Lil Uzi Vert’s past controversial actions as a reflection of the rest of the LGBTQ+ community, damaging their image worldwide. The idea ofgeneralizingthe specific characteristics of one person and applying derived conclusions toward the rest of their social group is a major, devastating fallacy that we have often fallen victim to. The same root feeds on the emergence of harmful stereotypes and widespread hate. The LGBTQ+ community does not deserve to be slandered because of Lil Uzi Vert’s past. Because of this, Lil Uzi Vert’s identity should not be considered when judging their past controversial actions and beliefs — their identity should be accepted without any judgment. We should respect Lil Uzi Vert’s identity and pronouns, but we certainly do not have to respect them as a person given their past abuse. Lil Uzi Vert is a flawed representative of the LGBTQ+ community, and they should issue an apology for their past transphobia, but still their harmful behaviors should not lead to hatred against the LGBTQ+ community."
wildcat_arizona_2022_35,"Protesters march in downtown Flagstaff with signs, one of which reads “Abortion is Health care! Health care is a right!” on Friday, June 24. The protest was in response to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade earlier that same day. OnSept. 23, protesters gathered outside the Arizona State Capitol building in response to Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson’snear-total abortion ban. The overturning of Roe v. Wade in June sparked a wave of abortion bans across the country. Johnson responded to the reversal of Roe v. Wade by lifting an injunction on an1864abortion ban. The reinstatement of this 1864 ban effectively made almost all abortions illegal in the state of Arizona, even in cases of incest and rape. Fortunately, onOct. 7, the Arizona Court of Appeals temporarily blocked this decision, meaning that abortions can thankfully resume. However, this decision by the Arizona Court of Appeals should not stop the fight for more abortion access. Strict laws, regulations and bans are being implemented in states across the country. Although our state was fortunate enough to bypass this ban, we still need to continue talking about the impacts of punishment for having an abortion. I ─ along with many others ─ am terrified for the future of our reproductive rights and our livelihoods in Arizona. Student and activist Jennifer Vo shared what many young women and people with reproductive capacity are feeling right now. “It is scary ─ especially in college ─ because even if I wanted to get into a relationship, I now don’t want that form of intimacy due to the risk,” she said. Vo is a senior in high school as well as the Southwest regional director of the grassroots organization,Generation Ratify, which works to ensure youth gender equality across the United States. She and I had similar sentiments and concerns about the repercussions this ban will have on students across Arizona. As someone who is about to enter college, she relayed that a lot of young women and students with reproductive ability are not as inclined to stay in Arizona due to the fear that their basic rights may be stripped away again. Similarly, with the threat of harsher restrictions on reproductive healthcare, college students and young people who are obtaining their education are finding it more difficult to remain in places with harsher regulations and bans on abortion. With such severe limitations on bodily autonomy that are becoming more common in legislation across the U.S., there is no doubt that students will not feel comfortable working or pursuing their education in states where their reproductive rights are threatened. I also spoke with Sarah Outland, the research director of the nonprofitGET Cities, which focuses on gender equality in tech workspaces. In regards to workplaces and companies, Outland found that, “In order to attract top talent, you really need to be in an equitable space, or you’re going to be missing out on half of the population that can make you so much more powerful.” A survey of4,400participants conducted by the Morning Consult found, “more than two in five working adults who say they’re concerned about losing abortion options for themselves or a family member are open to relocating to another state if they could keep their current job and pay.” If states like Arizona continue down the path of repressive bans on reproductive health, the universities and companies residing here must realize that they are losing students and workers. With access to abortion under Roe, a study done by American University found that with more access to reproductive rights, “womenexperienced a significant increase in labor force participation” and “women’s educational attainment also grew.” Student retention rates at any university can determine measures of success. It affects how universities are ranked, perceived, funded and the credibility they have. Workplaces also are concerned with retention rates for the same reasons. Therefore, it would be wise if universities and workplaces remain cognizant of how policies surrounding abortion access are affecting younger students and workers. RELATED:OPINION: Vote blue for the 2022 Arizona governor race I believe it is important to mention that ─ although many can find other places to work, live and seek abortion care ─ there are many who are in marginalized or low-income communities that do not have the capacity to move elsewhere. That only makes bans and regulations on abortion even more critical and urgent. Our rights deserve to be respected in all aspects of our lives, including our education and places of work. The University of Arizona, places of education and businesses must uphold these rights to maintain our willingness to pursue a future here. Unfortunately, it is often left up to us to decide the fate of the future in Arizona, so please get involved andvotefor this upcoming election. Arizonans’ reproductive rights depend on it.

You’ll find them or they’ll find you, and soon you’ll take part in classic UBC traditions with them. You’ll be convinced to Storm the Wall. Or you’ll fall incredibly ill after taking the plunge at the Polar Bear Swim at the end of term one. Maybe you’ll even come toThe Ubyssey’s retreat on Pender Island and get (safely shitfaced. These memories are what make these traditions worth it. Who knows, you might even create a few traditions of your own. Whether you’re taking your first few steps on campus or studying at IKB deep into your last year, know that you belong at UBC. But, if you need someone to rant to or celebrate your wins with, you have your friends and you also have us — a newspaper filled with students just like you.

crimson_2022_159,"“Dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es.” Tell me what you eat, I’ll tell you what you are. This line appears in French lawyer Anthelme Brillat-Savarin’s 1825 treatise “Physiology of Taste,” a foundational text for the field of gastronomy. With time, the aphorism evolved into the more familiar “you are what you eat.” As a vegan, the opposite rings truer for me — I am what I don’t eat. That is, I am known for what I don’t eat. And because of this, while I was at Harvard, I was the inevitable recipient of all of my friends’ grievances against HUDS vegan food. The greatest offender by far was the vegan cheese. Wherever this faux dairy solid appeared — kale-and-potato enchiladas, seitan cheesesteak subs, balsamic-glazed pizza — outrage followed. I’ve heard so many opinions on HUDS vegan cheese, almost all ferociously negative: “Why is the vegan cheese so gross?” “This pizza was perfectly fine until they put vegan cheese on it.” “Why can’t they just use real cheese?” Sometimes, it got personal — “It’s your fault they started putting vegan cheese on everything!” That isn’t true, though. I was not the only HUDS diner who didn’t eat dairy. A poll conducted last year by students in the “Animals and Politics” Expos section reported that, of 129 students surveyed, 6 percent followed a vegan diet. If we apply that rate to Harvard’s 7,095 current undergraduates, we get roughly 426 total vegans. So, at most, the responsibility is 1/426 mine. Nevertheless, among my friends, I endured the bitter whining alone. This culinary intolerance exists far beyond college dining halls. On Aug. 1, Southern-style comfort-food chain Cracker Barrel announced on Facebook that, for the first time ever, it would include plant-based meat on its all-day breakfast menu. Outrage ensued. Hundreds of commenters lambasted the restaurant for the “new meat frontiers” it advertised. Notably, this new option did not take the place of any existing meat choice — these people were outraged that a vegetarian meat substitute would be featured on the menu at all. As you “Build Your Own Homestyle Breakfast,” you still have the choice of bacon, smoked sausage, country ham, grilled chicken tenders, hamburger steak, spicy chicken sausage, country fried steak, Sunday homestyle chicken, sirloin steak, sugar ham, or country ham. What amazing abundance — more than ten breakfast meats to choose from, all day, every day, as part of a full breakfast that can come in at less than $10. Impossible Sausage merely joins the ranks. I’m from Nashville, Tennessee, a stone’s throw from the first Cracker Barrel restaurant, which opened in 1969, a time when plant-based Southern comfort food would have been an oxymoron. In this sense, Cracker Barrel’s pro-veggie menu expansion is a weighty sign of the times. The Cracker Barrel hullabaloo and my friends’ determined animosity toward vegan cheese exemplify an attitude I’ve observed throughout my two years of being vegan: All too often, non-vegans are hostile towards the inclusion of vegan alternative foods. To these militant animal-product purists, I say: Forgive me, I’m vegan. I couldn’t help but give up meat — I studied Earth Science and love this planet! I began college as a standard-issue omnivore, but during the summer after my sophomore year, a research project led me to quit eating animal products cold turkey. Actually, it was chicken — Trader Joe’s mini chicken tacos were my meaty Last Supper. That summer, I learned that livestock contribute 14.5 percent of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions globally, and that cows are especially egregious global-warming offenders, producing — or, more specifically, burping — copious amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. What we eat, I realized, can decide what our planet will become. And right now, it’s getting hot in here. In a world where massive corporations and governments make most major choices surrounding emissions of rich countries, eating a plant-forward diet is one of the most impactful choices the individual consumer can make to vote with their dollars for a cooler planet. I won’t lie to defend the gustatory merit of vegan cheese. Frankly, I think it’s kind of gross. It’s ooey-gooey-gummy in all the wrong ways. The texture’s off, the flavor’s off, but I cannot deny that I look forward to its appearances on the dining hall menu. I miss the flavor of real cheese, and vegan cheese hits the spot despite all its flaws. As this new semester begins, please skip the vegan cheese hate speech. Your non-dairy friends have heard it all before. If you don’t like it, just don’t eat it. And if you’re non-dairy-curious, give it a try. You might even enjoy it. Candice F. Z.

stanforddaily_2022_107,"— Dr. Ruth Starkman is a lecturer in Stanford’s Program in Writing and Rhetoric. I was dismayed to read in The Daily on Friday that the Board on Judicial Affairs will institute “yearly training on the Honor Code for every student upon entrance to Stanford and annually thereafter,” require students “to sign or otherwise affirm” their “commitment to abide by the Honor Code for every exam and major assignment” and other intensive interventions. Surely, the Board on Judicial Affairs well-meaningly intends fruitful discussions about students’ ethical obligation to do their own work. For newcomers unfamiliar with the rules, such training remains imperative. However, it is unclear how this new annual university enforcement will “give students ownership” or might ameliorate the problem of cheating. More likely, the proposal will exacerbate student anxiety while ignoring the root cause of cheating, i.e. poor assessment tools and exclusionary pedagogy. Some students may cheat because they remain unaware of the rules or because they had “poor time management” or “ought to have studied more.” Yet, the majority of students who cheat do so only in crisis. They arrive at Stanford with the best ethical intentions but too often find themselves floundering — usually in an introductory STEM course. Even with Stanford’s excellent tutoring services, some students continue to struggle with foundational concepts while the course moves to greater challenges. The pace remains notoriously fast. There’s too much material for 10 weeks. Worst of all, assignments far exceed beginning skill sets and high-stakes tests represent more than 50% of the grade. Students who perform poorly on heavily weighted tests may fail even if they complete all the other assignments for the course. This zero-sum game drives students to despair and cheating. Perhaps the top third of students confidently complete such prohibitively difficult introductory assignments, but statistics show this cohort comes from more privileged learning environments, which include high schools with AP courses and additional educational coaching, such as private tutoring, before arrival. These more privileged students enjoy greater success in STEM core courses that act as gatekeepers to desirable professional fields like computer science and medicine. Some people are let in, and some people are kept out. No amount of honor code training will prevent cheating if students feel they have no recourse and nothing left to lose. Stanford knows this; all of the academic deans who meet with students over honor code violations hear these stories of despair every year. These deans know the problems as well as the problem courses which disproportionately fail low-income students. Fixing those courses would do a lot more than compelling students to undergo honor code training. Stanford offers abundant resources for improving pedagogy, and they have long recommended changing unjust grading systems comprised of high-stakes assignments and exams. Our pedagogy experts offer cutting-edge advice on how to teach difficult subjects and keep standards high, while also being truly accessible. Despite awareness of Stanford resources, change remains slow. Currently, Stanford’s worst gatekeeping courses communicate a confusing mix of bravado and false inclusion. Some departments assert that mastering difficult p-sets should be like “learning to ride a bike, where you fall a lot.” Others gesticulate expressively, claiming “everyone can do this!” But talking the talk about inclusion means little if one’s assignments serve primarily the most privileged students. It is time to walk the walk and abandon the gatekeeping approach to learning. Stanford should undertake an investigation of the courses that produce the most cheating and ask what can change to make them more equitable so that all students can succeed. Instead of blaming students and policing them, we need to ask how instructors can do better. The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.

stanforddaily_2022_77,"Emma Master ‘19 is a staff member in student mental health and well-being. She serves as the Program Coordinator for “Meeting the Moment,” run by the Office for Religious and Spiritual Life, the Stanford Storytelling Project, LifeWorks Program for Integrative Learning, Health and Human Performance and Wellness Education. In Part One, I introduced the widespread problem of mental health distress in Stanford’s student body. I also reevaluated the University’s responsibility to address its students’ mental health needs, especially when those needs are becoming a safety concern and are created in part by the University and its high-achieving culture. Here, in Part Two, I offer some pathways to progress for mental healthcare at Stanford. There are concrete steps that Stanford can take to address this distress in a preventative and communal way rather than as a reactive response to tragedy. Many students have relationships and communities that support them when they face challenges; often at the heart of this are the Resident Assistant (RAs . I will not address RA roles much in this piece, but the topic deserves an article of its own. Student RAs are on the front lines, serving their peers in some of their most extreme moments of crisis, as well as providing everyday support that should not be overlooked. They do their best despite training that is inadequate for the mental health crises that they must handle, struggles to be heard and supported by the administration, low pay and more, all on top of leading their own lives. Currently, student RAs bear the brunt when formal institutional resources for student well-being lack the funds to meet student demand. In terms of these formal institutional resources, I see two major areas in which increased funding would greatly benefit students: Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS and wellness-oriented curricula (spanning Wellness Education, Health and Human Performance, LifeWorks, Institute for Diversity in the Arts, the Office for Religious and Spiritual Life, the Leland Scholars Program and more . Last fall quarter, Wellness Department classes at the University filled up even before freshmen had their enrollment holds lifted, so they could not enroll. For this spring quarter, my 35-person Wellness class “Meeting the Moment” filled as soon as enrollment opened, as did our 40-person waitlist. We are still getting emails from students asking to be added to the waitlist. CAPS is also under-resourced relative to students’ demands for care. Students have long complained of multi-week wait times between sessions and the difficulty of procuring long-term placement after they are referred out. When I was an undergraduate (2015-2019 , Stanford was constantly encouraging students to reach out for help when they needed it. At that time, the common narrative among students was, “I’m capable and competent. I can’t let anyone know I am struggling.” That narrative has changed. Now, many studentsareasking for help; the departments who give that help just do not have enough resources to meet that demand. Immediate-Term: Increase Resources to Meet Student Need As an immediate-term measure, both CAPS and Wellness require more funds to employ enough staff members to meet student needs. CAPS needs to be able to employ enough staff to effectively triage short-term mental health care and reduce wait times. While CAPS does have an on-call service for immediate crisis response, students in distress cannot experience weeks of wait time in between appointments. Wellness departments need to be able to offer enough classes to meet student demand, instead of having consistently long waitlists that are filled with students who are asking for skills to manage their distress and are being denied appropriate and timely care. Longer-Term: Structural Change As a community, we need to be clear about what CAPS is and is not. With 37 clinicians (some of whom work part-time , CAPS physically cannot provide long-term care for a student body of almost 17,000 — nor is it meant to. What CAPS is meant to do, as efficiently as possible, is to triage care so that students can be seen in the short-term, and then *ideally* be referred out to long-term providers if they still need care or ongoing support. Here’s the problem: the referral process is so long and arduous that students often give up before they are connected with long-term care, leaving them in a distressing state of mental health care limbo: needing care but not being able to get it because their short-term care expired andlong-term care is extremely difficult to obtain. CAPS gives students a provider search engine called “The Shrink Space,” which seems straightforward enough. However, due to high demand in the Bay Area, many providers on that list do not have openings, are not responsive to phone calls, or have openings too expensive to sustainably afford. The process of contacting a ton of therapists and having to keep track of all the threads is especially grueling when, as is the case for most people in this position, you are already in mental health distress. If you have a stomach condition and your doctor at Vaden cannot help you, they will refer you out to a specialist, where you can get an appointment through your Cardinal Care insurance. The same process should apply to mental healthcare. One possible solution here is for Stanford’s insurance to partner with long-term providers (both in-person and telehealth options to subsidize the cost of appointments, so that students can be referred out reliably and affordably. Stanford already has partnerships through its SHCA insurance with local providers that subsidize long-term therapy with copays as low as $5. While this is a considerable investment, further partnerships with long-term providers would be a powerful statement of Stanford’s commitment to supporting student mental health. Wellness Curriculum With regard to an integrated Wellness curriculum, I propose a Wellness class requirement for frosh year, perhaps in collaboration with pre-existing programs such as FROSH 101. We have STEM and humanities requirements. Why not a life skills requirement where students learn orientations and practices to cope with the darker sides of high-achieving and develop healthier relationships with perfectionism, stress management, self-criticism and dealing with failure? Students can learn emotion regulation and communication skills to strengthen their relationships, which are one of the strongest protective factors for mental health, according to theHarvard Study of Adult Development. These classes can also be spaces for reflection andthe cultivation of values, which are critical for meaning-making, another protective factor. In such a highly stimulating, fast-paced environment, students would hugely benefit from scheduled time in which to pause and reflect on how they want to make use of their time at Stanford and why — before launching into the workforce. While a wellness course is not a remedy for mental illness, it is a preventative measure which, when taken early, can encourage students to be more balanced and internally resourced. It gives them enough knowledge about their own emotional state to know when they need to outsource help to mental health professionals, as well as how to communicate with their peers if their peers are the ones who need support. Student mental health is multifaceted, and these issues run deep. While increased funding for CAPS and wellness curricula are necessary steps, there are many other factors outside of the scope of this article that I hope my peers and colleagues will bring to light; for example, the unsustainable pressures on RAs previously mentioned and efforts to support ongoing cultural competency initiatives at CAPS. Culturally, we stand at an inflection point with respect to mental health care. High-achieving athletes such as Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka are speaking out publicly about their struggles with mental health andthe strain of high performance. Health insurance providers are now covering more telehealth therapy and beginning to see mental health as on par with physical health after a surge in therapy use during the pandemic. Bay Area techcompaniesare expected to provide mental healthcare benefits in addition to physical healthcare benefits for their job offers to be considered competitive. Given the modern mental health crisis’disproportionate impacton our young people, universities are sure to follow suit. For any institution, where it puts its money is the true sign of its values. I invite Stanford to take accountability for what it is — one of the most selective schools in the nation with the best and brightest high-achieving students, taught and guided by an innovative faculty and administration — by stepping up in a concrete, financial way to prioritize the mental health of its students. Stanford is a national and global leader in research, academics and athletics alike. And comprehensive, accessible mental healthcare has become a basic, pressing student need.

rice_thresher_2022_58,"ByWills RutherfordandDiego Palos Rodriguez2/15/22 11:21pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. The other day I (Rutherford broke Rice’s rules — at least that’s what the security guard in the golf cart told me. Growing up as an avid runner near another small, private university in Texas, I, like much of my community, ran frequently on the university track. Hoping to maintain my fitness in college, I jogged to the on-campus Rice track early one morning through the open gates, and after barely finishing two laps was stopped by security. “You can’t run here,” he said. “The track is for Rice athletes only, and the gate should’ve been locked.” Why it’s a problem for a Rice student to run a few minutes on the empty Rice track, I don’t know. But rules are rules, and I politely exited the track to make way for the non-existent athletic practice. We think this policy is absolutely ridiculous, and we believe that Rice should open its track to student use outside of athletic practice hours. Running isone of the healthiest thingsstudents can do as it prevents many diseases, reduces stress and boosts happiness. Rice should continue to encourage this and open the track to all students, rather than only giving access to athletes. We’ve run on five different university tracks in Texas now, and only Rice makes it into an issue. While students can run many other places, opening the track to students would solve many problems. First, it would provide a safer place to run. In the evenings and early mornings — when many students like to exercise — the unlit outer loop is eerily untraveled and far from any blue light emergency boxes, while car and bike traffic on the inner loop means an increased risk to runners. Additionally, given the status of COVID-19, Rice should do everything it can to encourage students to exercise outside. Running on treadmills indoors at the Gibbs Recreation and Wellness Center is not onlyfar more likely to enable virus spread, but themask mandate makes treadmill running quite dangerous.. Anyone who’s run on a treadmill with a mask will know the associated feeling of light-headedness that often ensues, and passing out orfalling on a treadmill can lead to serious injury. Sprinting on a treadmill too, which is commonly seen at the Rec, brings an especially large safety risk compared to sprinting on a track. Lastly, track access makes running more accessible. Without a track, measuring distances becomes much more difficult without an expensive GPS watch or a clunky andoften-inaccuratephone app. If we would like to test our mile times for example, a track makes it so much simpler. Track running is alsoalso much easier on runners’ muscles and jointsand it’s essential for anyone hoping to practice specific distances (100m, 400m, etc . We struggle to see how a university which trusts its students with take-home and non-proctored exams should have any issues with its own students using the on-campus track outside of athletic practice hours. While there may be concerns about interrupting scheduled team practices or keeping the soccer field maintained, this is easily solved through a combination of communication from the athletics department and trust in students to follow the boundaries. This isn’t a novel idea, the Recallowsanyone with a membership to swim in the competition pool so long as they are not doing it while the swimming team is holding practice or another group has reserved the space. We think Rice should open the fence surrounding the track to Rice students, publish its available hours online and onsite and encourage students to build a healthy routine of running on the track. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

ubyssey_2022_44,"Dec. 22, 2022 Written byRynn Zhang I attended COP 27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt from November 6–18. According tothe UN Secretary-General, it s one of the most important gatherings this year since “climate action truly is the top global priority. Due of the location, there was a special focus on the African continent’s specific needs when adapting to the climate crisis. As world leaders, policy-makers and activists gather, I felt beyond honoured to have the opportunity to take up space in this conversation as an Official Observer. This means that as a student, I could, you guessed it, observe the negotiations and discussions that take place at a high level, and give my opinion when given the opportunity. On a personal scale, it’s difficult to begin to process and digest the incomprehensible statistics I’m confronted with every time I look at the news. I often feel like a single drop of water trying to terminate a forest fire. For me, choosing proactivity over reactivity likeStephen Coveytaught me has allowed me to want to change how things are done. I want to make traditional processes more environmentally responsible and better for the earth. I’m a materials engineering student because I want to change the way we extract, process, and manufacture materials. On a global scale, expectations were high for COP 27.Targetsand agenda topics included accelerating conversations about a country s climate action plan, delivering on an adaptation agenda, clarifying action to support loss and damage, making financial flows a reality and ensuring a managed and just transition. After two days of overtime negotiations, for the first time ever, a“loss and damage”fund was established, providing funding to countries that are vulnerable to the climate crisis. At the opening of the World Leaders Summit of last year’s COP 26, Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, delivered a powerful and movingspeechthat called on anyone who has “eyes to see, ears to listen and a heart to feel” to take climate action. Compassion is a mighty motivator because it moves us to become advocates for the injustice we see. In order to be compassionate towards those affected by the brutal impacts of the climate crisis, we must start with ourselves. As a perfectionist, the narrative I lived by was that no matter what changes I’m making in my life, it won’t ever be good enough and that whatever I’m doing, I’m not doing it right. It took deep inner work to uncover where this narrative was stemming from. This is also where self-compassion comes in. Acknowledging that the climate crisis is too massive for any one person to solve, I must lower my expectations of myself so then from that place of showing kindness to myself, I can then learn how to show it to others. The climate crisis is the biggest issue facing our generation and its adverse effects are felt by everyone. That can also add a new stressor and a new form of anxiety that previous generations haven’t felt before called climate anxiety. It’s all the more reason to be less self-critical. None of us are ought to carry the weight of this alone nor are we the only ones responsible. The last thing this planet needs is a bunch of perfectionists who are all waiting for the perfect solution before taking any action. Through my engineering studies, I’ve learned that climate action must be interdisciplinary. It takes synergizing and collaboration. It requires creativity in the ways that we see solutions. “To make a better future, we need our imaginations,” saidUBC Professor Simon Donner, a lead author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent Sixth Assessment Report. I must give myself permission to explore and collaborate, eliminating the pursuit of perfection, as imagination does not grow there. In preparation for COP 27, that was the narrative I told myself. Therefore, a compassionate heart must be at the centre of all climate action and it must start with compassion for ourselves. From a place of knowing comes wholehearted care, and then, and only then, comes sustained climate action. Rynn Zhang is a materials engineering student and attended COP 27 as an official observer.

stanforddaily_2022_98,"On Feb. 16, Fossil Free Stanford (FFS filed a complaintwith the California Attorney General alleging that Stanford’s continued investment in the fossil fuel industry violates California state law. Divestment is Stanford’s ethical imperative. The scientific reality of climate change isundeniable, and Stanford’s continued oil and gas investments financially and symbolically condone the industry’s continued release of greenhouse gasses and efforts to delay the green transition. Additionally, through itsinvestmentsin severalexchange-traded fundsandinvestment banks, Stanford continues to support companies such as ExxonMobil that haveattacked and discreditedmembers of Stanford’s faculty. Given the growing urgency of the climate crisis, FFS will take whatever actions are necessary to compel Stanford’s Board of Trustees to divest. While Stanford’s endowment remains invested in the past, peer institutions such as Harvard University have decided to stop funding corporations which are already responsible formultiple tragedies. Harvard’s Board did not make this choice on its own; rather, they were pushed to divest in large part because of the concerted efforts of student activists, and in particular the organizationDivest Harvard. While activists had been pushing Harvard to divest for years,successonly came in Sept. 2021, after these activists filed alegal complaintwith the Massachusetts Attorney General alleging that Harvard’s oil and gas investments violated state law. Now, in the face of Stanford’s complete administrative inaction, FFS has chosen to file a similar complaint with California Attorney General Rob Bonta. As the complaint alleges, Stanford’s oil and gas investments are not only environmentally and socially unjust — they are also illegal. Stanford’s investment in the oil and gas industry violates California law. Stanford’s endowment is regulated by the California Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (CUPMIFA , which stipulates that universities must consider “charitable purposes” when managing their endowments. Given the fossil fuel industry’s role in causing environmental degradation and social harm, including in the area around Stanford, Stanford’s continued investments in oil and gas are a dereliction of this duty. CUPMIFA also requires universities to invest their endowments “in good faith” and with “the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise;” Stanford’s fossil fuel investments violate these requirements as well. In funding oil and gas companies, Stanford has failed to act in good faith, because these investments violate its other commitments to the Stanford community. Fossil fuel investments are risky, meaning they violate the University’s duty under CUPMIFA to make “prudent,” non-fraudulent investments. As I noted in an earlier piece on divestment, due to energy price shocks, regulatory pressure and declining profit margins, “credit rating agencyS&P informedthirteen oil and gas companies in January 2021 that it might downgrade their credit score, a sign that fossil fuel investments are becoming riskier.” Especially now that peer institutions such as Harvard have chosen to divest, Stanford’s increasingly high-risk funding of the oil and gas industry infringes on its duty to invest with “the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise.” Stanford has made several other commitments regarding the University’s social and ecological impact that its fossil fuel investments directly subvert. Among the most important are Stanford’sFounding Grant, written in 1885, which commits the University to “promote the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and civilization,” and itsLong-Range Vision, which states that Stanford needs “a new way of working that enables us to tackle long-standing issues facing our society and our planet.” Yet by funding fossil fuels, Stanford is promoting the destruction of the future of humanity, civilization and the planet — a far cry from its ostensible commitment to “a new way of working.” More directly, the University has a duty to its students, a duty that Stanford flouts by funding companies which are destroying the planet’s future. Absent a livable planet, every other investment Stanford makes in its students is meaningless. And we do not need to wait 50-100 years to witness climate change’s effects; climate change is already endangering Stanford’s student body. Santa Clara county, where Stanford is located, is already athigher riskof wildfires and flooding, as well as heat-related illnesses, mental health conditions and socioeconomic disruptions, and this risk will only increase. Stanford’s investments are not just endangering the world at large; they are also directly impacting its student body’s safety. By failing to divest, Stanford is violating its duty of care and good faith to all of its students. FFS joins student organizations at four other universities — MIT, Yale, Princeton and Vanderbilt — in filing legal complaints with their respective state attorneys general. FFS firmly believes that sustained student pressure is the most powerful driver of the divestment movement. At universities around the country, student activists have successfully pressured their administrations to cease their support of the oil & gas industry. Now, with this complaint filed, FFS is hopeful that Stanford will finally accede to student and faculty pressure and divest. Will Halverson is a member of FFS.

wildcat_arizona_2022_62,"“Woman Vaping on Electronic Cigarette (JUUL ” byVaping360is licensed underCC BY 2.0. June 23 will henceforth be a day of mourning for vaping fans. TheFood and Drug Administration banned Juulfrom selling its infamous vape pen as well as four types of Juul pods containing nicotine amounts varying from 3% to 5%. The move is an exceptionally harsh one for Juul and its parent company Altria, the tobacco giant that sunk$12.8 billioninto the e-cigarette company in 2018. Banning Juul products from the U.S. market will likely help curb rates of teen consumption of nicotine, something that has plagued American high schools since Juul’s release in the mid-2000s. As early as 2018, high schools were struggling to deal with students who, as a result of vaping Juul products, began tosuffer from nicotine addiction. Those of us who recently graduated from high school surely remember the rushed bathroom breaks that saw billowing clouds of fruit-scented vapor pouring from tightly-packed stalls. It was, and still is, an epidemic that the FDA has sought to stamp out with military-like determination. But the FDA’s tough stance on Juul — and their larger aim of addressing public safety — pales in comparison to their weak response when it comes to public health hazards. Tobacco products cause upwards of7 million deathsacross the globe per year, but so do many of the products we put into our bodies every single day. Materials like non-stick cookware, cosmetics and many types of food packaging contain chemicals known asPFAS, which are well-known to cause somecancers and damage to internal organs. And the danger of these chemicals in our everyday products does not go unnoticed. In a study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2018,51% of adult Americansbelieved that the additives they were exposed to in their food presented a major risk to their health. Many factors influenced this type of thinking, but the fact remains the same: most Americans do not trust the FDA to keep us safe. And why should we? It took the organization seven years to take any meaningful stance against Juul and its pimply-faced teen worshippers during which children and adults alike were getting addicted to a product containing the amount of nicotine found inan entire pack of cigarettes. RELATED:OPINION: Graduating college is a big deal, be proud of yourself All of this is to say: the FDA ban on Juul and its products is a step in the right direction. But, it is not nearly enough to keep Americans and their children safe. Juul is not the only e-cigarette company with a chokehold on consumers. Cigarettes are not banned nor are the thousands of dangerous chemicals and additives that are in the food we eat and the things we buy. The type of dangerous additives thatwill stay with us, in our bodies and our environment, for decades to come. The prolific nature of these nicotine products and the other numerous hazardous chemicals that are commonplace in the U.S. raises many questions about how best to ensure human health. Yet, time and time again, the FDA has utterlyfailed to ensure the safe regulationof American food and consumer products. Sure, the ban on Juul is good. Maybe it will even help to calm down the irritatingly pervasive trend of vaping in every highly-populated public space. But until the FDA actually decides to begin regulating, and even banning, products with the attention and severity they have given to Juul, widespread public safety will still be a pipe dream.

On April 2, 2022,MIT announced that it was bringing back standardized testingrequirements for the class of 2023, amid massive waves of its peer institutions dropping them. This decision once again raised the issue of equity in the college admissions process. While the SAT and ACT have been criticized as “wealth tests” — students with more money generally have more resources to perform well —MIT actually citedthe tests’ ability to display excellence in spite of socioeconomic status as a main reason for reinstating the requirement, writing that it “helps MIT identify socioeconomically disadvantaged students who lack access to advanced coursework or other enrichment opportunities that would otherwise demonstrate their readiness for MIT.” But all this debate over the institutional use of standardized testing raises a broader question about the college admissions process that seems to get lost on the adults involved: how does this all make the students feel? For a high-achieving high school student, getting into your “dream college” seems like exactly that — just a dream. The class of 2025 faced a Stanford with a record-low3.95% acceptance rate. Harvard, Yale and MIT all had similar single-digit admissions rates, and thesefigures are falling fastat colleges and universities across the U.S. A perfect SAT or ACT score and stellar extracurriculars only help edge an applicant’s foot into the door of a college admissions office. And notwithstanding the extremely low chance of getting into these highly selective schools, the methods these colleges and universities use to admit students routinely tell students that their self-worth is defined by their college acceptances. Take the first question on the Common App: “Some students have a background, identity, interest or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.” At its core this question asks students to exploit the most meaningful aspect of their identity for the hope of a college acceptance. These types of essay questions are typical of “holistic admissions,” whichthe College Board definesas a process of evaluating an applicant based on “Mission alignment, … their likely ability to succeed … their ability to enhance the educational experiences of their peers … Consideration of multiple, often intersecting, factors — academic, nonacademic, and contextual — that, in combination, uniquely define and reflect accomplishments and potential contributions of each applicant in light of his or her background and circumstances.” In theory, this practice would allow students to succeed based on their authenticity as an applicant regardless of socioeconomic background. Instead, students mold their very being into an image of an applicant they think will appeal to admissions officers — undermining this goal of authenticity while simultaneously forcing students to exploit themselves in the hope of a college acceptance. And, as Stanford lecturer and Challenge Success co-founderDenise Popesaid, “some of these kids have had college on the brain since sixth or seventh grade or even earlier.” When at 10 or 11 years old one already believes that they have got to start making themselves into a competitive college applicant, the line between oneself and oneself as it appears to colleges becomes increasingly blurred. Getting rejected from your dream college, far from being a normal rejection, feels like a rejection of your verybeing, your heart and soul that you put into your application. Each component of the college process adds to the stress and anxiety students feel, especially among students looking for a coveted spot at a top 10 school. And note — since the pandemic,student anxiety has only gone up. In many exceptionally wealthy communities around the US — and especially the greater Stanford area — this anxiety and depression manifests itself in dark ways. Growing up in the Bay Area, it feels as though I’ve been acquainted with the negative impacts the college admissions process has on a student’s psyche my whole life. Hanna Rosin’s Atlantic article “The Silicon Valley Suicides,” which examines the suicide clusters of 2009-2010 and 2014-2015 in the greater Palo Alto area, came out when I was in eighth grade. It exposed the life-or-death bend that the competitive high school culture and the college admissions process can have. Rosin defines a “suicide cluster” as “multiple deaths in close succession and proximity.” Palo Alto is an exceptional case: “the 10-year suicide rate … is between four and five times the national average” at Palo Alto high schools. In the 2014-2015 school year alone, Palo Alto saw two youth suicide clusters — for context,in the US there are about five a year.The CDC conducted an investigationinto the suicide epidemic in Palo Alto after that cluster and found that the city had the largest youth suicide rate in the country, with 14.1 per 100,000 residents committing suicide between 2003-2015. After the 2009-2010 case, professionals from Stanford and the Bay Areahelped train staff and created a “toolkit”to prevent an echo cluster — a second cluster in the same location within a decade. Echo clusters are extraordinarily rare, so the two Silicon Valley clusters suggest that the band-aid solution of a “toolkit” won’t cut it — the culture has to change. Rosin argues that, when a high school consistently ranks nationally in terms of STEM programs, theater and arts programs, academics at large — not to mention the massive success of neighbors such as Mark Zuckerberg, Paul Allen or Elon Musk — excellence always seems out of reach. Part of this pressure stems from the economic environment in which these students exist. Professor Suniya Luther conducted a study that concluded that “rich middle- and high-school kids … show higher rates of alcohol and drug abuse on average … They report clinically significant depression or anxiety … at a rate two to three times the national average.” These stressors seem to stem from the pressure to excel academically and extracurricularly to ultimately “make a lot of money.” Many talk about the pressure parents put on their children to succeed, but — perhaps as an extension of their parents’ beliefs or some conviction of their own — other students apply this pressure to each other, too. This competitive culture creates a space in which it’s fine for students to brag about how late they stay up doing homework, lie about their test scores or humble brag about their summers abroad — creating a never-ending cycle of stress. While a lot can be said to the importance of creating a home environment in which students don’t feel this enormous pressure to succeed from their parents, the onus ultimately falls on all institutions to meaningfully improve the mental state of college applicants across America. Competitive high schools need to internally examine the types of behavior they promote and award — namely, asking students to stay up all night studying and working on college-level assignments starting at age 14 while simultaneously being star athletes and artists. And colleges need to stop demanding this profile from applicants to even get their name on the table. In the rush to label themselves as “prestigious,” “highly selective” and “nationally ranked,” these institutions have failed to actually uplift the population that relies on them the most: students.

rice_thresher_2022_59,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/15/22 11:19pm After last year’s Student Association election saw less than a fourth of the student body turnout to vote, we penned aneditorialcalling on students to engage further with the SA and its elections. As we approach another election — voting opens next Wednesday — we feel it necessary to reiterate our call. For anyone who has tried to raise student awareness of an issue, aired a grievance against the administration or tried to spur change on campus, now is the time to cast your ballot for who you want to represent the student body and fight for the issues that matter to you. There is a common misconception, somewhat excusably, that the business of the SA only concerns a small number of students. With this perception, people feel that they have nothing at stake in the elections and therefore don’t bother casting a ballot. But this year, the SA has been thrust into the spotlight over a variety of issues, such as the debate overmoving the Founder’s Memorialand thedisabling of the EarthCam. In both of those controversies, administrators cited SA concerns and suggestions as guidance for their actions. It is clear now more than ever that the SA plays a direct role in student life on this campus. So what should y’all do? Vote. Luckily, the voting process couldn’t really be any easier. The SA conducts its elections antithetical to everything for which the newTexas election lawstands. Every student is automatically registered, the ballot is emailed directly to each voter, and voting takes place online, 24/7 over eight days. All that being said, voting just for the sake of voting is not enough. You can and should educate yourself on the candidates to make an informed decision through any number of means. Visit the candidates’ websites and read about their platforms. Read our election coverage this week and our candidate endorsements next week. Attend the SA Presidential Debate on Monday night. And if all else fails, approach the candidates personally and ask them for their position on an issue you care about. Use your vote to shape the organization that can bring the issues you most care about to the forefront of campus discussion.

April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.

But, Senate can often be hard to understand for the average student, and theagenda docketcan be super long and dull to read. Senate Recentred is written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month. Here’s what to expect at the December 14 Senate meeting. Several changes are up for approval for this Senate meeting. Here’s a snapshot of a few of them: At tonight s meeting, the Nominating Committee will seek to approve three Senate members to join the President’s Advisory Committee for the Selection of a Vice-Provost and Associate Vice-President, Teaching and Learning. The position is currently held by Dr. Simon Bates. The University Librarian, Susan Parker, is presenting a recap of all notable library achievements and improvements over the 2021/22 academic year. The achievements are split into sections: advance research and scholarship; engaging with community; create and deliver responsive collections; inspire with innovative spaces and services; and steward the organization. Some highlights include: The Provost, Gage Averill, released theExternal Reviews of Academic Unitsat UBC Vancouver for the 2021/22 academic year. An external review committee determined key findings and makes recommendations to the university. Averill also released a memo that summarized the agreement between UBC and the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies (PWIAS . The Vancouver Senate approved the creation of the Wall Fellowships and Research Awards programs at its October 19 meeting. The Wall Fellowships and Awards will be funded by the Peter Wall Legacy Fund (formerly known as the Peter Wall Endowment . Each year, the fund will support two fellowships and a number of research awards for UBC faculty members and students, totalling approximately $4 million each year. Awards and fellowships will be committed to research that focuses on sustainability, at least for an initial period. This agreement “leaves the future” of the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies “explicitly in the hands of the Vancouver Senate.” Funding for current benefitting PWIAS scholars remains intact until August 31, 2023. Another academic committee, with input from the Vancouver Senate, will consider the future of the PWIAS as well as the desirability for an institute for advanced studies here at UBC. UBC will also be creating the Wall Collaboration Centre, a space to serve members of the UBC community, Wall Fellows and Wall Research Awardees.

stanforddaily_2022_99,"“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” – Goodhart’s Law As a fellow CS 106B student, I was reading dozens of Fizz posts about our midterm a few weeks ago, when a recurring comment struck me. It asked, in various forms: “did CS 106B get harder since I took it, or have freshmen just gotten softer?” Posts reporting extreme mental and physical distress as a result of the exam, which was taken over a 48 hour period, were followed by other posts, generally by older students, telling them that class/college/CS is meant to be hard, so we should get used to it. While I don’t think the “get over it” narrative is ever helpful, it brings up a valuable conversation about our approach to intro CS and education more generally. It’s probably most relevant to us fresh-faced first-years, but will be familiar to every student who has felt the pressures of Stanford’s perfectionist culture. The problem with simply being told to “toughen up” is that it presumes some kind ofchoiceto falter at hurdles; achoiceto be anxious and afraid, that is too often framed as entitled laziness. It’s not as though kids now are born with lower stress tolerances than kids growing up thirty, or even three years earlier. Rather, we are simply the results — the “successful” results — of a school system that equates intelligence with test scores and doles out opportunities based on that “intelligence.” Schools themselves are evaluated by these scores, and consequently inflate grades instead of addressing the root of the problem. As students, we need to reframe our entire view of education, viewing it not as a means to an end but as an ongoing process of mind- and person-building. We forget that the point of a class like CS 106B — an introductory CS class — is tolearnnew ways of thinking and problem-solving, not to measure our ability and weed us out of a field we’ve only just begun to explore. We don’t expect toddlers to run as soon as they can stand; we expect them to fall, we help them up and guide them, and most importantly, we delight in watching them gain confidence and go further and further. If toddlers were perfectionists, we would all still be crawling around, having miserably convinced ourselves that this is just the way it is. I’ve often fallen into the trap of thinking that if something doesn’t come easily to me — even after attending lectures, asking questions when I’m confused, doing assignments and studying a reasonable amount — then it’s not meant for me. If I can’t solve this problem even after staring at it for hours, then I just can’t hack this kind of thinking. But why am I juststaringat a problem for that long? Perfectionism makes it difficult to even try out an idea, which is precisely the process of learning; try, fail, fail again and again. You’ve probably heard this mantra a million times — “fail fast, fail often” is a favorite aphorism in Silicon Valley. However, not everyone has the same freedom to fail. For example, feminist academics have pointed out that the perfectionist mindset particularly limits women and girls, who are often raised with far less emphasis on building things “just to see what happens,” and getting back up again after being hurt. Additionally,people who are underrepresented in fields such as CSare often implicitly regarded as representatives for other marginalized students, especially when it comes to potential shortcomings. If we fail, we know we may confirm others’ biases, which adds even greater psychological pressure to immediately succeed and hide failures. Perfectionism isn’t inherent to anyone — it’s learned from the way that we are taught to reckon with failure and its consequences. This is not a “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” argument. There is a massive onus on Stanford to continue scrutinizingwhy certain classes lead perfectly capable students to cheator change their majors, and especially to provide greater support to students who come to Stanford from underserved high schools. But since these systems will be imperfect for our times at Stanford, being a little hard-headed and remaining adamantly undiscouraged throughout the struggle will help us to learn more than we ever expected, which will gradually lead to genuine confidence. If you’re not finding things difficult, you’re probably not in the right class for your current ability. I’m definitely not saying that I’ve achieved some sort of enlightenment and will now be perfectly happy to receive bad grades. But next time I’m trying to debug a few lines of code, whether alone in my room or in LaIR, I hope I can recognize thatthisis what learning feels like — not being able to pass all the tests after 5 minutes of work. As long as you’re trying, you are learning and you aresucceeding, whatever that means. Joyce Chen ‘25 is the chair of the Editorial Board for Vol. 263.

wildcat_arizona_2022_63,"A person takes a selfie for Instagram. Recently, I have been dissecting and pondering a compliment I receive sometimes: that I have a nice Instagram. I’ve been given this compliment more times than I can say, and my friends have, too. ”So-and-so has a nice Instagram,” we agree. We stare into the lives of these girls — because they’re usually girls — through a carefully crafted and filtered lens. We ooh and aah at their perfect social lives, effortlessly beautiful photos and what they had for brunch. We know that so-and-so just loves her sorority sisters and misses her dog that passed away last spring. We’ve never met so-and-so. But we know they have a nice Instagram. And perhaps while admiring them we begin to loathe ourselves. The beauty of so-and-so is that every single one of us is so-and-so. We all post perfect pictures with an audience of silent admirers who are deceived by the illusion we try to uphold. I look at my Instagram and while I see myself, I also see photos that couldn’t be less linear with both what I look like and what my life looks like 75 percent of the time. I don’t post photos of me crying, or bloated or when I don’t have any plans on a Saturday night. I don’t post these moments and neither do you — neither does your favorite so-and-so. Whether that is a comfort or incredibly unnerving, I guess, is entirely up to the individual. I want to emphasize that there is nothing wrong with not posting these “non-Instagrammable” moments of life — it’s human. We want to present ourselves in the best way possible, in a way of our own design. We can do this with Instagram, manipulate and control the way we want people to perceive our lives. We recognize this performative behavior within ourselves but cannot seem to discern it within others. RELATED:OPINION: Young people need to offer more humility to those experiencing homelessness in Tucson How have we become so blind to real life? Recent Instagram trends like photo dumps or the “make Instagram casual again” make it even harder for us to clear our vision. It is a sort of out-of-body experience looking at these seemingly effortless yet meticulously planned series of photos. A collection of drinks with friends, an aesthetic cigarette laying on the floor — all for the perfect Instagram feed. I see these photos and ask myself if we all collectively realize that the act of attempting to portray something as natural and effortless is a performance within itself. I see these photos and feel tired because the authenticity of our lives and how we perceive them deteriorates with each and every post. It’s easy to peer from the outside in, asking ourselves why our lives don’t look as fun as person A’s or why our abs aren’t as toned as person B’s. But, if we can’t separate real life from its Instagram counterpart, we won’t ever be content with the moments that matter. A study done by theRoyal Society for Public Healthfound that four out of five major social platforms made people feel worse about themselves and their lives. As crazy as it sounds, the terrible way social media makes us feel isn’t a deterrent for most — especially girls.A recent studyby the University of Essex and the University College London found that 40% of girls admitted to being on their social media accounts for more than three hours a day in comparison to only 20% of boys. It’s no coincidence that these statistics go hand in hand withgirls having higher rates of body image issues, depression and more. We know Instagram isn’t real, yet we continue to scroll. We know that it is harming us and yet we cannot seem to find the willpower to stop. We all have a nice Instagram, but unfortunately, that will never suffice for a nice life. It’s important to remember that our Instagram feeds and profiles are only a small and rather meaningless fraction of who we are. I can guarantee that so-and-so is much more interesting than the posts they curate for their Instagram profile — and so are you. If we are so wrapped up in the way that we want to be perceived, we’ll be unable to recognize ourselves. Follow Olivia Krupp onTwitter Olivia is a freshman who has yet to declare her major.

crimson_2022_158,"During much of the year, you won’t find Cantabrigians — residents of this frequently dark and frosty town — complaining about the heat. But from May to mid-October, it’s hot and humid in Cambridge. And it’s only gettinghotter. Opening the windows does little to circulate the stagnant air of my third-floor Westmorly bedroom. While hot dorms might seem inconsequential, sweltering suites carry consequences. Comfortable indoor temperatures enhance learning in two ways: by improving sleep and long and short-term educational achievement. Harvard must keep this in mind now and while renewing the Houses. The College should allow personal air conditioning in undergraduate housing, and incorporate central, building-wide air conditioning in renovated Houses. Extreme temperatures have negative impacts on sleep, performance in the classroom, and overall health. And campus is getting hotter — Boston set multiple heat records this summer, reaching almost 100 degrees in early August. In dorms with bad ventilation, the indoor temperature can remain hot throughout the night. Not only do people with sleep disorderssleepbetter at lower temperatures, but people who sleep in warm environments also experience elevated stress hormone levels. Cooler temperatures also increase metabolism, which can help peoplemaintaina healthy weight. Regulated temperatures in dorms are especially important in the post-Covid era, given that some courses, research projects, and many job interviews remain completely virtual — meaning students are spending substantially more time inside, exposed to unpleasant temperatures. High school students learning and taking exams at high temperaturesperform worse, both on the particular exams and over their cumulative high school careers, demonstrating the short and long-term effects of unregulated temperatures. Even if exams at Harvard are held in air-conditioned spaces, consistent learning in an uncomfortably warm environment can still lead up to inferior exam performance. House building managers and Yard-ops cite several reasons to disallow window air conditioners, from thepotential fire hazardtoelectricity consumption. However, these concerns are outdated. Fire hazards are not the worry they once were because many new styles of personal heating and cooling units are muchsaferthan previous models. If building managers are still concerned, they could check that portable units are properly installed, instead of banning them altogether. While it’s true that both personal heating devices and air conditioners use significant amounts of electricity, modern portable air conditioners have significantly reduced power consumption — some use just five times the power of the College-approved minifridge offered by Harvard Student Agencies. Window air conditioning units must be allowed in College housing, but they are not an ideal long-term solution. Central, building-wide air conditioning must be installed in renewed Houses. To be clear, air conditioning should be available in all student rooms, not just hallways and public spaces like the House library or dining hall. Central air conditioning is more equitable, too: Every student should have access to air conditioning, not just those who can afford a window unit. The upgrades will likely use more electricity, and they won’t be cheap. But the improvement in student health and comfort is well worth the cost. Regulated temperatures are not only a matter of comfort but also educational achievement and health and safety. The College should not sacrifice the health, academic potential, and comfort of its students to save on energy costs. The advantages of regulated temperatures are great. The College must invest in central and building-wide air conditioning in the renewed Houses. For now, a (verboten window unit will have to do. Kanishka J.

stanforddaily_2022_106,"At the end of Vol. 260, The Daily conducted its third demographics survey. The survey allows The Daily’s editorial staff to evaluate its initiatives on fostering diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI and also provides staffers with the opportunity to share feedback on what they would like to see change at The Daily. As part of our commitment to transparency, we are sharing the results of this survey. You can find the results from our past two end-of-volume demographics surveyshere. 91 staffers filled out the survey, and though the data are not fully representative of our staff, which numbers over 250, it still offers important insights. The Daily aims to have the demographics of its staff and editors to meet or exceed Stanford’s regarding the representation of staffers from underrepresented backgrounds. We generally achieved this goal with regards to our representation by race and international student status, but can still improve upon diversifying our editorial leadership and staff in regards to LGBTQ+ students and students with disabilities. About half of respondents identified as cisgender women, with this category making up 50.5% of all survey participants. 41.8% of staffers who filled out the survey identified as cisgender men, while transgender and nonbinary indiviudals made up 1% and 3.3% of respondents, respectively. 31.9% of survey respondents identified as LGBTQ+, and approximately 10% of respondents identified as having a disability, infirmity or longstanding illness. The majority of participants were not international students, with international students making up 11% of all respondents. For comparison, international students are 13% of Stanford undergraduates and one fourth of all students. In addition, 56% of Daily staffers who responded to the survey are receiving some form of need-based financial aid from the University, compared with 49% of respondents from our Vol. 259 survey and 47% of all Stanford students, according to the University’s financial aidwebsite. 17.6% of our respondents identified as first-generation college students, and 18.7% had a parent who attended Stanford. The survey shows that a majority of staff is white and East Asian, which is consistent withfindingsfrom the Vol. 259 survey. Approximately 15.4% of respondents identified as Latinx and 11% identified as Black, in comparison with 17% and 7% of Stanford students, respectively. Native American students are the most underrepresented ethnic group at The Daily, which is also reflected indatacollected by Stanford’s IDEAL (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Access in a Learning Environment initiative. Finally, just over 50% of survey respondents had no journalism experience prior to joining The Daily, in comparison with nearly two-thirds of respondents from the Vol. 259 survey. The survey also solicited qualitative feedback from staffers on their perceptions of DEI initiatives at The Daily. Some common threads included a desire for more mentorship of students with no prior journalism experience, requests for increases in community-building initiatives — especially at the desk level and among graduate student staffers — and more transparency and education in regards to the pay structure of the editorial staff. Furthermore, while most respondents said they felt valued for their contributions and appreciated the opportunities The Daily provides for professional development, some did not feel they had a voice in decision-making at the paper. The Daily takes this feedback very seriously and is committed to bolstering community-building initiatives, listening to the voices of staffers and the broader Stanford community and increasing transparency and access for all members of our organization. Some steps we are taking to achieve these goals include launching editor feedback forms, which will allow staffers to provide their editors with suggestions and recommendations for how they can be as helpful as possible. These feedback forms offer a safe avenue for staffers to share what’s working and what’s not, and to voice concerns. In addition, we hope that these forms will help us improve our editing practices and carry crucial institutional knowledge. In addition, in response to requests for more mentorship, we are hoping to expand and strengthen our mentorship program for new staffers, continue to host affinity group events for staffers from different backgrounds and again hold aSummer Journalism Institutefor incoming first-year and transfer students from backgrounds underrepresented in journalism. We hope that these measures will help us bolster diversity, equity and inclusion at The Daily and beyond so that our staffers feel at home at The Daily and so that our readership is able to consume a diverse range of content that represents their communities.

The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. The words “free speech” will likely elicit groans from Thresher readers. Over the last three years, there have been three articles in the Opinion section bemoaning the need for a “classically liberal” political discourse at Rice. Unfortunately, between their self-righteousness and needless wordiness, they read more like whiny lectures than conversation starters. However, despite their condescension, their existence does suggest something unsettling about not just our campus politics, but politics at large. As the electorates of democracies around the world have become more sharply divided, the way we speak to each other, not just across the aisle but to our similarly minded partisans, has become more accusatory, exclusionary and violent. Put simply:we do not want to talk to each other, and understandably so. It is exhausting, and, more than that, we just don’t seem to know how to. In the lead up to the midterm election, I spent a lot of time thinking about why we’re so divided. Why do those free-speech articles seem so commonplace? Why did the Rice University College Republicans pull out of the Baker Institute Student Forum debate last Monday (because there was, in fact, plenty of time to prepare ? Why, in a nation that ismostly alignedon how it should progress — with the majority of Americans agreeing on the need to address the climate crisis, abortion, gun regulation, legalizing cannabis, teachers’ pay, preserving social security, congressional term limits, etc. — do we still find ourselves stuck in a decades old, mostly rhetorical, culture war? Discounting structural barriers to fair representation like the electoral college, suppressed turnout or gerrymandering, it seems to me that the cause of our marked disagreement is the rise of neopopulism — that being populism and the internet. Populism requires an enemy. Right-wing populists make enemies out of those deemed threats to economic or social tradition — be that the “establishment,” “socialists,” “illegals” or any other group. Left-wing populists find an enemy in the extremely wealthy and cultural conservatives — rebranded “fascists.” Populism is thus both reductive in its name-calling and addictive in its effect. It’s based on just enough truth, no matter how twisted, that most people, from moderates to radicals, feel that there is a group to blame for their problems: it’s their fault. It’s your fault. Really though, fault lies with the emergence of an information ecosystem whichthrives on hate-clicks. We have been gradually conditioned to become really bad communicators. We fear each other. We distrust one another and do not want to listen. Why would we? Doing so would require listening to perspectives we view as ignorant, hateful, cynical or just plain wrong regardless of where each arguing party falls on the political spectrum. But there is another way. There exists a simple politics of humanness. A politics where we begin our conversations with a single, irrefutable baseline assumption: we are the same species, worthy of the same respect and the same fundamental rights. We are homo sapiens with different skin tones and individual presentations. We are homo sapiens with, more or less, the same physiological components. The constructs that we have created to separate us, like race or religion, distract us from how alike we all are and that it is in our best interest to collaborate. Where we must agree: We need places of our own to call home. We need access to healthy food and clean water. We need respect for our bodily autonomy. We need to live lives free of arbitrary oppression and to rid ourselves of every trace of its legacy. We need to be able to work sustainably, and have time for other pursuits. We need to exist with dignity and need justice when we are wronged. We need to acknowledge where we differ and afford each other understanding. We need mobility, joy and love. To create a world without extreme division and which emphasizes the best quality in our species — our ability to work together – we must first have consensus about what our shared humanity means. If we cannot agree on the core premises above, then we have every right to collectively call out those who do not see everyone as equally human. A failure to recognize what makes us human is a failure to come to the table for discussion. Those who hold fast to positions of supremacy at the expense of others by dehumanizing them or who promote hierarchy on the basis of artificial difference, cannot be reasonably debated and have forfeited their ability to make an argument. There is, undoubtedly, strength in diversity. Natural divisions, such as the tendency of humans to form communities of like-minded individuals — or of those who share our specific identity — can be extremely beneficial. I do not believe that we should all be the same in every way, or that our differences are not important; often the identity of a person or group is central to how we go about resolving a problem — such as the way we approach the many manifestations of systemic inequality. However, I increasingly believe that working together with our ideological opposites will require emphasizing issues of human importance. We must first agree that humans, being fundamentally the same, require the same basic prerequisites to live well. We can build a university culture and world which rightfully acknowledges our differences, but to build a world that is humane, we must start with the things that we share. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2022_21,"I have followed the issue of sexual harassment and sexual violence for some time, and am particularly struck by Stanford’s insistence that students serve as “upstanders” and act to discourage and report sexual assault. While in principle there is nothing wrong with this notion, it seems to shift the responsibility back onto students. The responsibility for this violence should be shared, and disproportionately by the administration, faculty and staff. Those who have been invited to Stanford to learn and enhance their educational experience have more than enough to do. As a member of the faculty, I am most disappointed that, outside a handful of faculty like Michele Dauber and Roanne Kantor, hardly any of my colleagues have taken a vocal, public and consistent stance against sexual violence. It is relatively easy to sign petitions, it is much harder to sit in faculty meetings and bring up this subject in a sustained, and often uncomfortable, manner. On the contrary, faculty who wish to address this issue are often ostracized. And this has been happening for decades — Herbert Lindenberger, an extremely senior member of the English faculty, now deceased, told me that he was effectively shut out of the English department because he pressed his colleagues to do something about Jay Fliegelman, who has beenaccused of rapingone of his former Stanford advisees. The overwhelming tendency has been to close ranks and to grasp onto any excuse not to say anything. Hardly a case of being “upstanders.” Sadly, this is a national phenomenon. A well-publicized and ongoing case is that of Professor John Comaroff at Harvard, who has targeted female graduate students for years. As Inside Higher Educationreports, although Harvard found Professor John Comaroff guilty of “verbal conduct” that “violated the institution’s sexual and gender-based harassment policy and professional conduct policy,” Harvard has welcomed Comaroff back to campus after a mandated leave of absence. As noted in the same article, Harvard’s graduate student union is circulating a petition that states, “We reject the widespread norm in which senior academic figures who jeopardize or end the careers of their junior colleagues through misconduct and retaliation are themselves subject to only mild and brief professional consequences, and are indeed supported by their peers.” Three graduate students are suing — but they are naming Harvard, not Comaroff, in their suit. Stanford might want to pay some attention to this case. The complainants accuse Harvard of badly mishandling nearly every aspect of the case, includingobtainingone student’s psychiatric records and sharing them with Comaroff’s lawyers. Harvard has argued that it should not be held responsible for anything, but the US Justice Department has filed anamicus briefarguing the opposite. It reads in part: Harvard’s claim that it is immunized from liability for the retaliatory acts of its own faculty members lacks support in the applicable law. In fact, the relevant case law instructs that: (1 retaliation is a form of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX; (2 unlawful retaliation may be carried out by the employees of a federal-funding recipient; and (3 the recipient may be found liable for damages under Title IX for such retaliation where it amounts to an official act or policy of the recipient, or where the recipient is on notice of such retaliation and is deliberately indifferent to it. What is most shocking to me as a faculty member is the fact that in the midst of the Harvard investigation, 38 very senior members of the Harvard faculty rushed to defend their colleague. They signed a passionateletterquestioning the process and personally vouching for Comaroff’s character. In doing so, they endorsed an account rooted almost exclusively in apress releaseauthored by Comaroff’s lawyers. Let there be no mistake — those who signed include many of the most “progressive” scholars in studies of race and ethnicity, history, literature and environmental justice. They include Homi Bhabha, Paul Farmer, Henry Louis Gates, Jr, Stephen Greenblatt, Jennifer Hochschild, Jamaica Kincaid and Marcyliena Morgan. All to say that one cannot expect intellectual commitments to trump social capital. “Upstanders” indeed. The Harvard Crimson issued this scathingeditorial: The well-documented, informal norms that lead American police officers to shield their colleagues from accountability have been dubbed a “blue wall of silence.” As we look at this ill-informed open letter, signed by 38 tenured faculty members, among them some of Harvard’s brightest stars, it is impossible for us not to worry that this power asymmetry continues because members of our faculty have erected their own wall of silence within our Cambridge campus. In the long shadow of that wall, it can only grow harder for victims to come forward with their stories. Shielded from transparency or accountability, faculty-student power imbalances will continue to cause concrete harm. We thus reaffirm our belief (rooted in a different, also disturbingly mishandled, set of accusations that sexual misconduct should be grounds for revoking tenure. I myself would support revoking tenure from any faculty member found in violation of University policy or federal law regarding sexual harassment or sexual violence — it would send a strong signal that, in order to remain a part of the Stanford community, faculty can no longer act with impunity. For those who are untenured, it would be grounds for deferring tenure. It was only after a massive national and international protest that many, but not all, of the Harvard signatoriesretracted— and their retraction was almost as embarrassing as the initial letter itself. Entitled simply, “We Retract,” theletterstates, “We are retracting our open letter published in the Harvard Crimson on February 4th, 2022. Our concerns were transparency, process and university procedures, which go beyond the merits of any individual case. We failed to appreciate the impact that this would have on our students, and we were lacking full information about the case.” There are many lessons for Stanford’s faculty to learn if they want to seriously address issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence, rather than close ranks around offenders, pretend the problem does not exist, or throw up their hands and say there is nothing they can do. First, we can work with experts to make a profound change in culture. In 2016, while a fellow at the Clayman Institute for Gender Research, I organizedan eventthat brought faculty from across the nation to share experiences, strategies and information. Among the participants was Professor Jennifer Freyd, who haswritten extensively on institutional betrayaland the common behavior of institutions in addressing issues of sexual harassment and violence. Freyd coined the term “DARVO” (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Oppressor . Another participant was Professor Simone Sharoni, who started the national organization,Faculty Against Rape. Professor Dauber also invited leaders from the organizationKnow Your IX: Empowering Students to Stop Sexual Violence. But even outside becoming involved in national campaigns, with just a little imagination and political willpower, faculty can take important steps forward. For example, faculty can ask their departments to put a statement condemning sexual harassment and sexual violence on their website’s landing page, clearly explaining how such acts are destructive to any learning community and that they will not be tolerated in any shape or form; add statements in graduate student handbooks committing the department to watch against any possible act of retaliation for bringing complaints forward; actively provide students every resource necessary to engage outside scholars as mentors should their relationship with their mentor be stained by sexual harassment; listen when students ask for extra time or extra funding if they have had to use both to address instances of sexual harassment; give financial support to students who wish to form reading groups and support networks to learn about their rights. Individual statements of support, saying that you are available to meet, are important, but they cannot take the place of proactive, sustained efforts on a collective level to change the culture of silence and acquiescence.A previous version of this article misspelled Roanne Kantor’s name.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_1,"18-year-old law student Debanhi Escobardisappearedafter partying in the outskirts of Monterrey, Mexico, on April 9. On April 21, Escobar’s body was found in an underground water tank near a motel where authorities searchedfour timesprior. The cause of death was determined to be ahead wound, meaning that she died before she was dumped in the tank. Escobar’s death sparked massive protests because while her case is chilling, it is not uncommon. In Mexico, more than24,000women are currently reported missing and1,000were murdered last year. To make matters worse, Nuevo León state prosecutor Gustavo Adolfo Guerrero remained dismissive of the tragedy, claiming that women who disappear are doing so voluntarily or as an act ofrebellion. The statistics concerning missing and murdered women in Mexico, as well as the response of those in power, provide ample evidence that a cultural shift is necessary. In the early hours of April 9, Escobar left the party in a private car and exited the vehicle into the side of a highway, where the driver allegedly left her, with no apparent cause as to why, leading Escobar’s father toaccusehim of trying to grope her. The driver, identified asJuan David Cuéllar, who has been previously investigated on account of harassment and attempted kidnapping of women, was interviewed for Escobar’s disappearance, but authorities stillhave notdeemed him guilty or related to the incident. A picture of Escobar taken by Cuéllar went viral, partly due to the victim’s family’seffortsto garner attention to the case. It is very possible that had it not been for the family, Escobar’s case would have been ignored by the authorities, like thousands before her. Before Escobar, public outrage had been brewing after astringof young women disappeared in Monterrey, only to be neglected by the authorities. The New York Timesreportedthat “despite the staggering numbers, the cases of missing women are often downplayed or ignored by the media and local authorities,” who treat cases as “as isolated incidents, not a systemic issue.” Worse than the disappearances are the killings. Escobar’s likely murder also rekindled memories of a wave of femicides in 2017 that took the lives of3,825women. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a progressive politician elected to the presidency in 2018, promised to“transform”Mexico into an equal and less corrupt country, so many Mexican feminists were hoping that he would put an end to the devastation. However, things only got worse: on average10 to 11women were killed daily, compared to six before his inauguration. The start of 2020 witnessed two horrific femicides that sparked protests, in response to which López Obrador complained about a“feminist collective”that holds beliefs he does not share. The president’s response highlights the complete disregard for women that is encouraged in a patriarchal society. In order to reduce femicides, one must understand the cause and consider the context of violence against women. The United Nations Human Rights Council considersfemicidesto be “end of a continuum of violence against women, set against general patterns of discrimination against women and tolerated impunity of perpetrators.” According to manyLatin American feminists, such violence stems from “gender inequality, society structures such as patriarchy, impunity and institutional violence;” all of whichfunction alongsidemale ownership and entitlement, masculinity associated with dominance, strict gender roles, and an attitude of passiveness and acceptance towards domestic violence. If the United Nations, as well as Russell Diana and Radford Jill, whom Toledo Vásquez references in her report Feminicidio, are right in saying that femicides represent theextreme continuum of anti-female terror, which includes a wide variety of verbal and physical abuse, such as rape, torture, sexual slavery, emotional harassment, sexual harassment (on the phone, on the streets, in the office, and in the classroom , genital mutilation, unnecessary gynecological operations, forced heterosexuality, forced maternity, and other things, then tackling these issues one by one — starting from the bottom up — can shed a light of hope to despaired women in Mexico. It is probable that the issues of femicides and disappearances are not given the attention they deserve because other forms of sexusm still thrive, which pose a peril to women’s humanity and autonomy. Therefore, changing the perception of even something seemingly unrelated, like abortion, for instance, may very well act as a step in the right direction. While abortion is legal in Mexico, many statesprohibitit. Abortion bans serve to dehumanize a woman by treating her merely as avessel, so it is not surprising if the perpetrators of gender-based violence subconciously internalize the message that a woman’s body is not her own and can be disrespected and abused because the law implcitly permits it. Advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights can also function to greatly reduce femicides, as women and their bodies are respected and given autonomy instead of forced to a man. Stopping sexism from its root, too, is an important aspect. The “light” sexual harrassment directed at women in the workplace and on the streets contribute to the idea that femicides are accepted, because, from the very beginning, women are viewed in terms of sexual objects, rarther than fully-fledged humans with lives. It is easier to verbally abuse, physically torment, and eventually kill an object than it is to kill a human being for this reasonlaws againstworkplace harassment, abortion bans, domestic violence, rape, and many more, should be fixed to protect women. Martin Luther King famously said that “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” Arguably, the reverse holds true: justice anywhere can be a threat to injustice anywhere. Eradicating sexism and all of its gritty forms is only a part of the equation. However, Mexican law grants impunity to those murderers. In 2018,93 percentof crimes were either unreported or uninvestigated. This is not surprising given that the victims are “battered and discriminated against when trying toaccess the justice system”, both of which show alack of credibilityof the reports. In short, women lack access to a judicial system to which they should be entitled. When men do not receive fair punishments for their crimes, they are not discouraged from committing them, Ana Carcedo argues in heranalysis. The State sends a message of“permissiveness and tolerance” towards violence against women, which leads to77%of Mexican women reporting feeling unsafe in their own country. Both Carcedo and Marcela Lagardemaintainthat femicides are more likely to happen in places where they are not punished harshly. Therefore, in addition to battling “milder” forms of sexism, femicides should betypifiedas a unique kind of crime, distinct from general homicides. While the Senate did vote to make the crime a separate felony, it committed a grave mistake by blaming previouscorrupt administrationsrather than addressing systemic sexism. The criminalization of femicides and the confrontation of institutional misogyny must go hand in hand; fulfilling one without the other dilutes the cause. Moreover, since authorities are just as guilty of perpetuating femicides as the murderers themselves, theUNHRC hypothesizesthat “If public authorities can be punished because of negligence, public authorities are discouraged from discriminating women or exonerating victimisers… femicide rates should decrease ”. There is a third, quite insidious, factor to the rise in women’s disappearances and murders: the culture of machismo. Machismo is a type of toxic masculinity prevalent in Latin American and Hispanic cultures,characterized byan entitlement to dominate, superiority of men, and the assumption that virility and outward demonstrations of strength are tied to masculinity. Many Latina womenrecountthe ways in which the men in their family asserted dominance over the women, while othersrecallhow they were taught to accept sexual harassment and assault as a form of flattery. When male dominance is actively encouraged and violence against women is viewed as complimentary, femicides and disappearances of womenceaseto be seen as a problem requiring national attention. The good news, however, is that despite being ingrained so deeply in the fabric of Latin American and Hispanic societies, machismo can be unlearned, according to feminists. To start, it is important to talk openly about the issue, according toCarolina Hoyos Bolívar, a member of Las Guamas, a collective that organizes monthly meetings in Colombia. In the United Nations, the American Psychiatric Association has publishedguidelineson how to approach the issues men face, and theManKind projectis encouraging men to open up about their emotions. A similar program has reached Latin America, with the EU in Colombiasetting upThe National School for the Unlearning of Machismo (ENDEMA . In both countries, the goal is the same: to allow men to ponder deeply the harmful attitudes of machismo and to teach them that anger is not the only emotion they are allowed to express. In Mexico City, Gendes, a civil society organization,offers group therapyfour days a week to men who have engaged in domestic violence. The group gives examples of men who have benefited from the program, includingJorge Alberto, who learned to respect his girlfriend’s decision to end their relationship and has attempted to promote Gendes to colleagues. To encourage more men to seek professional help, however, the stigma against both therapy and men’s mental health must be removed. Educational and literacy campaigns, such as incorporating chapters on mental health, including men’s mental health, in school curriculums, and providing better training to healthcare providers about the issues men face, have been found effective atreducingstigma. Such educational efforts must also consist of an understanding that mental illness is not purely psychological and cannot be fixed just by a change of behavior.“When her Latino patients understand that chemicals in the brain play a primary role, they view the diseases differently.”explains Dr. Lorenzo. Men like Guerrero and López Obrador have already given in to the patriarchy and based their masculinity upon mistreatment of and disregard for women, but there is hope that the next generation’s leaders could be men — and women — who have unlearned toxic ideals.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_52,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a plan that would expand the state’s Medi-Cal program to virtually everyone in the state on Jan. 10. Currently, Medi-Cal is California’s health care program for low-income residents. It is currently available to those under the age of 26 and over 49, providing coverage to over13 millionCalifornians. Newsom’s proposed expansion would provide coverage to all California residents who meet the income requirements, regardless of age and immigration status. The expansion could potentially provide access to over700,000 additional people. The proposed plan, if agreed upon, would be fully rolled out by January 2024 and would cost an estimated$2.2 billionannually. “California is poised to be — if this proposal is supported — the first state in the country to achieve universal access to health coverage,” Newsom said in a Jan. 10 budgetnews conference. California has long been a trailblazer in progressive policy. However, Newsom’s proposed plan would still fall short of the“single-payer healthcare”idea, which was integral to his campaign platform in the 2018 election. This means that those who do not meet the income requirements for Medi-Cal will still have to secure their own coverage. Despite the frustrating difficulty of implementing single-payer healthcare, the proposed Medi-Cal expansion must be approved. In recent years, California has seen a steep decline in the number of uninsured individuals primarily due to theAffordable Care Act. However, the federal expansion of health coverage leaves behind one of California’s most important demographics — undocumented immigrants. Newsom hopes to change this. According toa studyconducted jointly by the UC Berkeley Labor Center and the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, nearly two-thirds of undocumented immigrants under the age of 65 lack health insurance in California. This is staggering when compared to only 10% of all other Californians in the same age range. Californians and Americans alike should all be working towards a healthier population. To achieve this goal, health care access should be available and affordable for everyone. Because there is undoubtedly more work to be done, California legislatures should continue pushing for a more affordable universal approach. Recently,CalCare, California’s proposed universal free healthcare that would leave behind premiums and deductibles, was introduced in the state assembly. However, this program has along and difficultroad to implementation. California’s more modest Medi-Cal expansion to include undocumented immigrants is a needed step toward achieving a healthier population. Moreover, the undocumented population largely contributes to programs such as Medi-Cal through the$3.2 billionthey pay in taxes each year. By providing access to Medi-Cal, the undocumented population will finally have access to the programs they help pay for. The need for unrestricted healthcare has never been more clear. The COVID-19 pandemic has causeddisproportionate effectsfor undocumented individuals due to many factors. Undocumented workers are much more likely to be essential workers, with an estimated fourout of fiveworking jobs that are deemed essential and high risk for catching COVID-19. Americans have always relied on the contributions of undocumented immigrants — this was only made clearer when the pandemic started. As jobs were divided into “essential” and “non-essential,” Americans were forced to gain a new appreciation for those doing the jobs that are too often overlooked. The least that California can do is provide safe and secure healthcare to those who help the nation’s largest state function. While it is important to highlight the many ways in which undocumented immigrants contribute to our society, it is even more crucial to understand thathealthcare is a human right. Immigrants must be seen as human first and foremost before they are ever considered as documented or undocumented. Their needs must be met regardless of immigration status. Sure, Newsom’s plan may not be the single-payer healthcare he or his supporters originally hoped for and more radical change is needed, but the magnitude of this plan must not be underestimated. It will send the message that all Californians are human and deserving of basic human rights regardless of immigration status. This plan, if agreed upon, will change lives.

wildcat_arizona_2022_34,"An image of the album cover ofMidnights, Taylor Swift’s newest addition to her discography. Taylor Swift released her 10th studio album,Midnights, on Oct. 21. The 13-track album is about 13 sleepless nights she has had throughout her career. This album marks her return to pop after her previous two albums,folkloreandevermore. Swift has not released an all-original album sinceevermorebecause she has been busyre-recordingher first six albums. After Swiftannounceda new album when she was onstage at the MTV Video Music Awards, I freaked out. I have been a Swift fan since 2006 and have loved the music she has released. She has helped me through all the ups and downs of my life, and the release ofMidnightsis no exception. When the clock struck midnight (or 9 p.m. in Tucson , I rushed to Spotify to listen to the album for the first time. I could tell this album would be one of my favorites from the first song. The first track, “Lavender Haze,” shocked me because I did not expect this album to be a pop album. Being a fan for so long, I have heard her country, pop, indie and now her return to pop. This song is about wanting to be in a bubble when you are in love, where nobody’s comments can get to you. The second track, “Maroon,” is a more grown-up version of her song “Red,” in which she uses colors to represent her emotions. In the song, Swift writes about different shades of red, and maroon is a darker version. This song goes through all the stages of a relationship: becoming friends, entering into a romantic relationship, facing the trials of long-distance, having issues and eventually breaking up. “Maroon” is more grown-up than “Red” because it’s about a more mature relationship that mentions intimacy and sex. The third track, “Anti-Hero,” is an upbeat song with heartbreaking lyrics. It’s about her insecurities about her moral character and how Swift feels she is never doing enough. She calls herself out with the lyrics, “It’s me / Hi! / I’m the problem.” Swift has beenridiculedthroughout her career for dating, and this song is her rewriting how the public views her and taking back some of her power. The fourth track, “Snow on the Beach,” featured Lana Del Rey, which I was excited about, but I was ultimately disappointed as Del Rey only had background vocals. The song is about feeling weird about falling in love, but how it’s a beautiful thing. It’s about a person falling in love with you at the same time you’re falling for them. I love this song, and one of my only dislikes of this album is that Del Rey did not get a verse. The fifth track, “You’re on Your Own, Kid,” made me cry the first time I listened.Notoriously, track fives on Swift’s albums are the most personal and vulnerable, and this is no exception. It follows a girl who loved someone in the past, but he was holding her back. She writes about how you’re on your own now, but you made it without them. This song resonated with me because I’ve been independent for so long that I didn’t realize I didn’t have anyone around me to celebrate my accomplishments with me. The sixth track, “Midnight Rain,” took me by surprise because of the interesting synth intro, but it quickly became one of my favorites because of the lyrics and the experimental synth. It’s about ending a relationship to keep her career as a musician. Swift and her lover were opposites, but she sometimes thinks about what could have been if they had stayed together. The seventh track, “Question…?,” is about asking questions to a former lover to see how the two relationships compare. She wants to know if her ex still thinks about her when she reminisces about their relationship. This song reminds me of sharing secrets with my friends about the people they’ve kissed and teasing each other about who we’ve been with. The eighth track, “Vigilante Shit,” has majorReputationvibes and is about getting even instead of being sad. The song follows the story of a mistress helping the wife get back at her cheating husband. This song is surrounded by rumors of who it is about, but Swift rarely mentions who her songs are about. This song reminded me of the late Princess Diana Spencer because of hericonicrevenge dress and Swift mentioning “dressing for revenge.” The ninth track, “Bejeweled,” is the song that grew on me the most. I did not like the beat or the lyrics during my first listen, but now I adore them. It’s about Swift knowing her worth and going out knowing people will be in awe of her. She knows she is the ultimate prize and is not waiting for a man to realize that. The way she says the word “shimmer” in the song scratches my brain just right. The 10th track, “Labyrinth,” is about being scared that you’re falling in love so quickly. She thinks the love will not last because she barely got out of a relationship and is already falling in love. I liked the repetition of the lyrics “Oh no, I’m falling in love” because every time she sings them, she adds a different emotion, like being scared or being excited. The 11th track, “Karma,” refers to afan theoryabout Swift making an album calledKarmaafter herreputationera that she did not release. The song is about Swift sitting back and watching her enemies get what they deserve. This song surprised me because I thought it would have darker lyrics instead of being an upbeat and fun song. RELATED:Concert Review: The Joy Formidable at The Rialto Theater The 12th track, “Sweet Nothing,” was written with William Bowery, aka her long-time boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. This song is a beautifully written love song about finding peace in the chaos. Since Swift is one of the most famous musicians in the world, her life is chaotic, but her relationship with Alwyn grounds her and helps her to be more at peace. The 13th track, “Mastermind,” is about a relationship being meant to be. She planned to ensure Alwyn would be in a relationship with her when she first saw him. When she told Alwyn that she schemed to get them together, the song mentioned that he had known all along. I think it was a great album closer because it wraps up the album by being about love and how women have to be calculated to get what they want. When Swift releases an album, the world listens. On Oct. 22, SpotifyannouncedSwift broke the record for the most-streamed album in one day. In its first four days of release, Swift had thebiggestequivalent album units sold since Adele’s25. It also had the biggest traditional album sales week since her albumReputation. After four days,Midnightshad the biggest streaming week of the year with357 million on-demand streams, the largest streaming week ever for an album by a female artist. All of the records she’s broken so far have been well-deserved. She has constantly been reinventing herself to have a successful music career — and it worked. Her experimenting with darker lyrics and returning to her roots of writing autobiographical songs has helped her connect with her fans. I loved that she went back to writing about her personal life because, other than her music, she doesn’t share her personal life with the public anymore. The release ofMidnightsshows that Swift still has what it takes to be a powerhouse, even after her 18 years in the music industry.

The blog is dedicated to platforming those traditionally left out of comedy circles like BIPOC, women and 2SLGBTQIA+ people. Blog also wants to produce aspoofissue thatbreaks the internetjust as much as last year’sGirlbossmopolitandid. The science section strives to decolonize its reporting by prioritizing the voices of Indigenous researchers. We also want to make peer-reviewed research more accessible to students to spotlight and interrogate the groundbreaking research UBC produces. Our photo section wants to foster a diverse and welcoming community that facilitates access to the photojournalism industry and inspires a general interest in photography. The photo section also wants to include those traditionally underrepresented in visual narratives to increase both breadth and depth of coverage for those communities. We are committed to ethical and engaging visual reporting and hopes to provide guidance by hosting workshops and guest speakers . The visuals section — the paper’s graphic design and illustration team — wants to create a welcoming environment for students by holding workshops that focus on design fundamentals and providing a space for students’ art and creativity to flourish. Visuals will also be providing education on the Adobe Creative Suite, what we use to make our beautiful bi-weekly print issues. As the only newspaper that covers what’s going on at UBC down to a ‘T,’ we have an obligation to hold the power on our campus to account. Our news section is working to demystify governance, whether that’s about the University Neighbourhoods Association and how it impacts students, or our continued coverage of the AMS, Board of Governors (BoG and Senate. And our news, features and sports sections are continuing their commitment to hold campus institutions — like the BoG and UBC Athletics — accountable through investigative pieces. Like the news section, opinion is looking to demystify governance by re-establishing guest written columns that relate to student governance, as well as holding institutions on campus accountable for their sustainability promises throughUnwreck the Beach,The Ubyssey’s sustainability column. These are our goals for the next year and we ask that you hold us to them. With you keeping us accountable while we keep the institutions around us accountable, we’ll become better students and journalists, one article at a time.

stanforddaily_2022_37,"Imagine: Come this fall, the new Doerr School of Sustainability will welcome its first cohort of students onto the Stanford campus. They will be joining a team of leading scholars, practitioners, and students to advance sustainability solutions at the speed and scale required to address the urgent climate crisis. Transdisciplinary scholarship and a commitment to environmental justice will be embedded across research projects. Instead of providing research funding to sustain their current business models, fossil fuel companies will look to the School to implement ambitious and credible action plans aligned with the Paris Agreement, entailing immediate, systems-scale investments in clean energy. This is not the School we have today. Following the announcement of the new Sustainability School in May,many have questionedthe School’s commitment to climate and sustainability solutions, with more than780 people signing a petitioncalling on the School to decline future funding from fossil fuel companies. The Coalitionhas demanded atransparent processfor determiningshared values and principlesfor the School, including open public forums and a commitment to establishing strong criteria for industry funding partners. We have not yet heard a response to these demands. The Doerr School must take a more proactive approach to address the concerns that have been raised. Here we summarize why the Doerr School’s relationship with the fossil fuel industry is damaging to our university’s reputation, values, and research integrity, and invite the Stanford community to imagine a different future for the Doerr School. 1.Our current stance damages Stanford’s reputation. It is clearly detrimental to Stanford’s reputation that a new school focused on climate and sustainability issues isentangled with the fossil fuel industry, which has actively undermined action on climate change fordecadesandcontinues to do so today. While we cannot change the School’shistorical tiesto the industry, our future reputation depends on the choices and decisions we make today, including decisions about phasing out partnerships with companies thatdo not meet the School’s own minimum criteria. 2.Partnering with fossil fuel companies undermines the School’score values. In addition to itswell-documentedhistoryof disinformation campaigns, the fossil fuel industry has repeatedly engaged in unethical, corrupt, and polluting practices (seePetrobras,Chevron,Shell,BP,ConocoPhillips,ExxonMobil that have contributed toenvironmental racismanddisproportionate harmtovulnerable communities. Here also lies a clear contradiction to the school’s commitment toenvironmental justice. How can the School claim to take environmental justice seriously, when it does not hold accountable the very actors who have created many of the problems we are trying to solve? If you don’t find the above two arguments convincing, you might say: The logic that our economy depends on fossil fuels — and therefore we should help fossil fuel companies be cleaner — breaks down once we consider the disproportionatelobbyingandmarketingdollars (including aSuper Bowl ad that our partners have spent tolock in fossil-fuel dependency. It took significant external pressure, a failed project, and rising debt levels for a company likeØrsted to turn away from fossil fuels, not the sudden vision that a fossil fuel-free future was possible. That vision seems far away when theindustry reaped $205 billionin 2021, and stands to gaineven more this yearsince the war in Ukraine (ExxonMobil posting itslargest everquarterly profit of $17.9 billion , with profits going to increase short-termshareholder valueoverinvestments in clean energy. And, as a research university, we absolutely cannot compromise on the third argument: 3. Accepting fossil-fuel funding damages our research integrity. The influence of industry funding on research lies not only inwhat gets published, but also in theresearchnotundertaken, the words that remainunspoken, and the questions thatdo notget asked. Thus far, ourindustry-funded researchspans oil reservoir exploration and management, enhanced recovery of oil, and hydraulic fracturing. Meanwhile, marginal contributions tostorageandcarbon captureresearch remain part of the industry’slatest strategytodelay true climate action. Despite public statements supporting the Paris Agreement,none of our partnersare on track to comply with the Paris Agreement and they have not made commensurate investments in renewable energy. Exxon-Mobil invested only0.22% of capital expendituresin low-carbon projects between 2010 and 2018, andBP invested only 2.3%,while quietly divesting all of its solar and wind assets by 2013. Meanwhile, their affiliation with Stanford for a fee of $25k-250k a year plus“additional funding”of undisclosed amounts distracts from the millions spent topromotefossil fuels andoppose climate policies, most recently againstelectric vehiclesandCO2vehicle tailpipe standards. Not only do industry partners claim their contributions to Stanford as a contribution to climate action (seeExxonMobil,BMJ reporting , they haveexclusive accessto Stanford faculty and students, while members paying a premium are given permanent seats on a governance board that gets toset research priorities in the Natural Gas Initiative(ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips , a direct violation ofStanford’s policy. This is not an equal relationship: Stanford’s fossil fuel industry partners have much more to gain from their affiliation with Stanford, while Stanford becomes a complicit partner indelaying climate actionand incrementalism. If we stay silent as Stanford community members, we are equally complicit. An Alternative Future We believe the case is clear that the status quo is more damaging to Stanford’s reputation, values, and research integrity than an alternative scenario where the Doerr School proactively revamps its industry affiliate programs, establishes clear and stronger criteria for funders and partners, and commits to transparency in its future funding decisions. If we agree on the above, then we can start asking some important questions: Stanford’s actions and words matter. This fall quarter will be critical for laying the foundation for the Doerr School’s future. We hope that you will join us in building atrue School of Sustainabilitythat we can all be proud of.

rice_thresher_2022_18,"ByWills Rutherford9/20/22 11:46pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Comments like “What’s with the suit? What’s the occasion? Who’s getting married?” surrounded me as I strolled into my college commons one day last fall. It caught me off guard; why am I the only one dressed up on career fair day? My bioengineering friend quickly answered my question. “Why should I bother going to the career fair?” he said. “There’s no bioengineering companies there.” He’s absolutely right. But the problem extends beyond just bioengineering. Rice is undeniably thebest university in Texasand arguably the best university in the southern United States. We’re home to the brightest students and tomorrow’s innovators and leaders. Yet, Rice stifles its competitive edge by failing to connect its high-achieving students with the nation’s top job opportunities. I firmly believe that the simplest way for Rice to jump from regional to national prominence is for it to attract the greatest companies from across our nation to our campus. I know that Rice is certainly capable of it. Who wouldn’t want to hire a Rice graduate? Looking at the list of companies attending this year’s official career fair, however, I see a different picture. According to Handshake, the career fair this year contains just ONE bioengineering company. No Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Moderna to be found recruiting at theNo. 9 bioengineering school in the entire country. As Rice celebrates 60 years from President Kennedy’s famous speech, I wonder what happened to our connection with space exploration and aerospace? Only two aerospace companies recruit at Rice, and none of them are Boeing, Lockheed Martin or SpaceX. Why are semiconductor companies like Intel, Texas Instruments, NVIDIA and AMD, that are desperate for talent, not recruiting our electrical engineers? Apple is building a$1 billion campus and hiring 4,000 new employeesa mere three-hour drive away in Austin;Tesla recently completedits Gigafactory there. IBM, Google, Oracle, GM and many others have huge campuses in the city too. Yet, if a Rice student wants to work at any of those companies, their best option now is to upload their resume along with thousands of others and hope for the best. I can count on one hand the number of fellow students I know who’ve been successful at that endeavor. Getting into Rice should be the hard part. When I tell friends and family about this issue, they’re taken aback. “Those companies don’t recruit at Rice?” They’re not alone either. Some frustrated Rice student-run organizations even took it upon themselves to create “Night of Networking” to expand opportunities for Rice engineering students. This event is only for engineers though and occurs very late in the recruitment cycle (when many companies are already interviewing candidates . It also doesn’t use Rice’s official recruitment platform Handshake. As someone who’s been through four recruitment cycles, I see how those factors greatly limit the event’s impact. The bigger issue I see here though is why aren’t the companies that attend an unofficial Rice event at the official career fair? It makes me wonder if Rice ever even reached out to any of the above-mentioned companies regarding recruitment. Surely many companies are seeking the high-caliber talent that Rice offers. Many of them go to career fairs at other Texas universities, like theUniversity of Texas at Austin,Texas A&M Universityand Texas Tech University, to fill their open roles. I will say that Rice does find some great opportunities, particularly in oil & gas. But it leaves so much on the table, especially for non-engineering students and those looking beyond a career in energy. I also don’t wish to bash any companies currently attending the career fair. I thankfully found a job through the career fair that I absolutely enjoy. I merely feel that given Rice’s reputation, it should attract a much broader set of companies and should expand far beyond just the energy industry. It’s no surprise to me that Rice ranks the lowest of the top 20 schools for outcome in TheWall Street Journal’s 2022 ranks, falling right below the University of Florida. I went to a large Texas high school that usually sends a few students to Rice every year, and I often receive calls from younger students interested in Rice. I always tell them the same thing: Rice is awesome, I absolutely love it. But if you want a job in industry, think twice about coming to Rice. Save your money, go toUTor A&M, and you’ll have more career options. Until Rice provides its students with the career opportunities that they deserve, my belief stands firm.” April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

wildcat_arizona_2022_22,"A headshot of Julian R. Vaca courtesy of the subject. On a mid-November afternoon, I had the chance to sit down withJulian R. Vaca, author of the novel, “The Memory Index.” Vaca had reached out to me via Twitter about reviewing his book, a young adult dystopian novel that focuses heavily on memory and what it means to us. The novel was a great read — especially if you’re a fan of any and all things 1980s — but I had an even better time chatting with Vaca himself about his book, career advice and the nature of authenticity. Vaca may have burst onto the publishing scene with this debut, but he has been in the game for a long time and knows how to talk about a good story as much as he knows how to write one. “The Memory Index” follows two young teenagers in an alternate 1987 where a perplexing disease has stolen the memories of almost the entire population, leaving most to rely on artificial recall to access histories that should rightfully be theirs. This book is one that is close to Vaca’s heart. “I’ve always been fascinated with the intersection of identity and memories and memory keeping and memory making,” he said. “The book kind of goes into heady, philosophical questions of identity.” Such philosophical questions (like does memory make us who we are — a big order for a dystopian novel to fill imbue the novel with literary meaning but also with a sprinkling of personal flavor. Vaca talks about “The Memory Index” like it is a beloved family heirloom passed down from generation to generation — and for him, it likely is a culmination of many different pasts and presents. “For me, as a first-generation Mexican-American,” he said, “I have a really interesting story in that I didn’t learn Spanish growing up. In a lot of ways, my mother’s memories, my father’s memories, their memory keeping of their own stories and their own childhoods really helped bridge the gap between my present and my past .” A nice touch in the novel, Vaca told me, is that one of the protagonists, the determined and whip-smart Freya, shares her last name with Vaca’s mother. Izquierdo was his mother’s maiden name, and so having a piece of her in this story is something that makes his words glow with pride. However, Vaca did not always have one of his protagonists in his dual POV debut be Mexican-American, an identity he also shares. In the first iteration of “The Memory Index,” Freya was actually a 17-year-old Black girl. This choice, Vaca noted, was to try and provide a bit of representation for his niece and nephews, who are mixed race. Yet after his editor flagged a few parts of the manuscript and sent it over to a sensitivity reader, Vaca realized that Freya’s story needed to be more authentic to him. “When you tackle something like that, writing in a voice like a 17-year-old Black girl, you’re going to be called to task on the authenticity of the voice,” Vaca said. “So that was a big realization for me to make the decision to pivot and have Freya be a first-generation Mexican-American.” The subject of authenticity in fiction writing, especially in young adult fiction writing, has been a hot button in the publishing world in the last few years. With the rise and fall of the#OwnVoiceshashtag that existed on social media for a brief but impactful moment, the search for diversity and representation in children’s and young adult books has exploded. While there is some disagreement about what makes a book have “good representation” — a term so vague that a Google search will yield thousands of articles with different takes on the subject — Vaca stands on the side of what the #OwnVoices movement would have affectionately called “authentic representation.” He elaborated on the choice to change Freya’s race, saying, “I had this look in the mirror moment where I was like, ‘what am I doing?’ I’m forcing something here.” Even over Zoom, I could tell how passionate about this subject he was — his voice, a bit crackly due to an unsteady WiFi connection, rose audibly and cast a resounding echo around my room. “I have an opportunity to speak to my own heritage and my own story from an authentic place. This is an opportunity for me to actually speak to my story and my core, and so that was a huge light bulb moment for me,” Vaca said. In a time ripe with confusing notions of what is and is not okay to write about in a fictional universe, Vaca’s humility both surprised and delighted me. It takes a brave person to admit their wrongdoings, and an even braver person to try to make it right. Vaca isn’t just focused on writing authentic stories in his books going forward, he is also determined to be a guiding light for young readers — many of whom may be struggling to find stories that represent them and the lives they do (or want to lead. When I asked him about his thoughts on writing fiction that offers guidance and provides comfort to young readers, Vaca had a lot to say. “I was on a panel this weekend with some truly remarkable authors and one of the authors said ‘authors in the young adult space need to be more intentional with showing hope and light in our works’ — not everything is despair, not everything is just incredibly, incredibly tragic,” he said. Vaca paused there and looked into the distance — a mysterious and slightly shrouded place beyond the purview of the Zoom camera — before doling out his resounding words of wisdom. “Yes, there is a lot of brokenness to humanity, and we ought to continue to incorporate that into our stories, but there’s also a responsibility to show hope, to show light.” This was a take that I found interesting coming from an author who created a dystopian world that gave me chills just imagining it. But, this opinion seemed to fit into Vaca’s ideology about writing, especially when that audience is young and impressionable. The duty to create content that is helpful for young readers goes beyond just writing authentic characters and stories and into intentionality. Vaca also talked about the pervasiveness of inauthentic content, the type that comes to us in the form of short, 15-second Instagram reels that feature hilarious videos one second and sweeping travel porn of Ireland the next. This type of media — at least in Vaca’s view — is there purely for consumption. It’s content that makes you want to pull out your phone during the short pause a red light will offer you. “Intentionality is key because there is so much vying for people’s attention these days,” he said. So, in his own work, Vaca prioritizes authenticity over everything else because of his belief that writers (authors in particular have an “urgent responsibility” to create work that brings more good to the world than they take from it. This desire for authenticity, to speak to his character’s experiences and provide meaningful stories that might one day help someone who needs it, is a touchstone of his work. “I think as artists, as writers, as creators, we owe it to our readership and to our fans to be really intentional in what we create, because people are going to see right through it if you’re just creating for creating’s sake or if you’re not being authentic,” Vaca said. RELATED:OPINION: BeReal is a masterclass in performed authenticity Yet, striking the balance of authenticity can be difficult to find even for an author like Vaca, who has seen his fair share of success. Young writers in university who are just beginning to find their voice when putting pen to page (or fingers to the keyboard feel the pressure of churning out content for content’s sake. Many of our own writers here at theDaily Wildcathave expressed the frustration of creating stories that wow as much as they incite reflection. Having traditionally published a fiction novel with another forthcoming next year, spending some time writing for season three of the PBS show “Reconnecting Roots” and working on a documentary called “Pencil Test” (currently in post-production , I figured Vaca may be able to shed some advice on how to not only produce authentic content but be successful with it. Vaca prefaced his advice with a dose of salt, “My journey is a little unorthodox,” he said, but moved on quickly, almost sounding sheepish as he shared his industry secrets. “I think for so many people who get work in this industry, a throughline — and gosh, this sounds like such a cheap cop-out answer — is discipline and work ethic.” I have to admit I found myself deflating just a bit. The hope for newbie writers such as myself is that there will be one branch in a sea of thorns that you may be able to grasp hold of to climb your way to the top. However, there was a sort of comfort in Vaca’s words, his bare-bones advice giving both me and himself a kind of breath of relief. “Put in the work reading, and put in the work writing, and it will surely bear you fruit,” he said. At the end of the day, Vaca stressed that your success is what you make of it, but you don’t have to do it alone. In an industry known for being cutthroat, not many people advertise turning to a community for guidance; but Vaca underscored the importance of surrounding yourself with a community as a writer — for help, for guidance, for accountability. “I don’t believe we were created to be in this individual mindset. We were created to be a collective. A source of encouragement and hope, especially in my most insecure moments, has been my community,” Vaca said. This sentiment was tinted by a love and admiration for his support network that was clear even through a video call. I was inspired by Vaca’s obvious closeness with his community, his joy at getting to lean into their encouragement and love. It made me think that there might be a bit of hope for those of us who wish to one day be where Vaca is now: A successful author buoyed by a community that won’t let him disappoint them or himself — a community that helps him tell the most important stories that speak to his soul. “The Memory Index” is Vaca’s book of memory and ghosts — both good and bad. The book is steeped in blurry lines and complicated questions of morality, but Vaca’s own life and philosophy stand in a bright outline that’s clear to anyone who meets him. Above everything else, Vaca is grateful, and I can think of no better authenticity than that. Follow Sophie Applin onTwitter Sophie Applin is the Opinions Editor for theDaily Wildcat.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_44,"UCI Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Hal Stern sent an email on Jan. 21, announcing that in-person instruction would resume on Jan. 31. “The decision to proceed was based on broad consultation with the community, including … student government leadership,” Stern stated. According to the Associated Graduate Students (AGS and the Associated Students of the University of California at Irvine (ASUCI , this is false. As AGS’ Vice President of Financial Affairs, I can attest firsthand that we were blindsided by the University’s announcement. ASUCIsharedour bewildermentat the claim that student government leadership had been consulted in the university’s reopening decision. UCI claimed they consulted leaders. But did they really? The lack of communication suggests that administrators’ words simply cannot be trusted. Stern’s email is particularly frustrating because student government leadership had specifically asked UCI leadership at the advent of the omicron variant last quarter and again at the beginning of this quarter to consult with the student governments. From our perspective, UCI flagrantly ignored that request. ASUCI and AGS believe that the university must publicly apologize for falsely claiming that student government leaders were consulted and for failing to consult student government leaders about a decision that directly impacts students. There are manyquestions that the university has failed to answer as a direct result of their failure to consult with student government leaders. Among the most pressing is how education at UCI will continue to be accessible for disabled and immunocompromised students. Some of these students are currently able to seek accommodation from the Disability Services Center (DSC . However, the DSC cannot help students who are not themselves disabled or immunocompromised but who live with and/or care for someone who is. One student, for example, told AGS that they live with their 89-year-old diabetic grandmother. This student commutes to UCI, but current university policy gives this student no option to continue learning online in order to protect their vulnerable loved ones. The AGS Board has heard dozens of cases like this in the past week. Again, there are manyconcerns the university must address to allow for a safe and accessible reopening. It is urgent that UCI immediately enact a policy of universal access, allowing anyone to self-determine if they need to continue learning or working online. No documentation needed, no questions asked. Many students may prefer a return to campus. However, obligating students to return — as is the case for many students under the current policy — is ableist. I am, frankly, shocked at the lack of planning and care that UCI’s current actions demonstrate toward disabled and immunocompromised people. The university still has time to make this right. To do so, they must publicly apologize for their false statement and for failing to consult student government leaders. They must also immediately enact a policy of universal access. Until then, the question remains: can students trust UC Irvine? Canton Winer is a sociology Ph.D candidate at the University of California, Irvine. He is also the Vice President of Financial Affairs for the Associated Graduate Student government. He can be contacted atcwiner@uci.edu."
crimson_2022_119,"Suffocated formore than two yearsby an agonizing pandemic whose global grip only finally appears to be loosening, Muslims around the world look forward to the revival of community life with the recent start of Ramadan — a month of fasting from sustenance and sin, observed each day from the hours of sunrise to sunset. For Muslims who practice this ritual, Ramadan is a profoundly special period. The month’s value sits uniquely at the interface of personal and collective spiritual growth, where, in abstinence of worldly pleasures, our devotion to Islam can be cultivated both within ourselves and our Muslim communities at large. For me, this year’s observance of Ramadan promises a particularly exciting, though almost unfamiliar, return to spiritual community. It marks my first communaliftar— the meal to signify the conclusion of the daily fast — and my firsttaraweehprayers — the set of community-led, nightly prayers distinct to the month of Ramadan — in three years. Perhaps most exceptionally, this will be my first Ramadan away from home, at Harvard. Before Covid-19, I had never considered that it would be a luxury to no longer merely imagine, but to live a proper, in-person, Ramadan on Harvard’s campus. And at a time when my memory of a communal Ramadan has begun to slowly erode, the newly-resurrected opportunity to cherish this sacred experience with the Harvard Muslim community this year — from iftar to taraweeh to simply our presence with each other — should be fundamental to remembering this month’s central project of community-building. But tonight, I’ll be breaking my fast in an organic chemistry lab. Canonized as the boogeyman of undergraduate pre-medical requirements, organic chemistry is certainly no small mountain to climb. It is often regarded as the most well-oiled machinery in the industry of pre-medical hazing, whereby introductory science courses are often cruelly designed to carve hierarchies of the most “capable” future scientists and physicians — and all those who elect to prioritize other passions oreven their own mental healthare systematically discarded as the “weeded out.” My organic chemistry lab section, though — a four-hour-long program of molecules and mechanisms from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. each Monday night — has the additional pleasure of weeding me out from parts of my first experience of an on-campus Ramadan. Tonight, and every Monday night in April, I will exchange my communal iftar for my lab coat, my taraweeh prayers for my lab notebook, and my religious community for my lab section. This month is my first Ramadan on campus, and it is my first Ramadan in a lab; the fact that I must — in the words of course staff — find a way to “balance” the two reveals the existence of an insidious infrastructure festering beneath Harvard which judges marginalized identities as inconveniences. Students of underrepresented backgrounds should not be pushed so far to the margins that they must plead loudly and uncomfortably to belong at Harvard. Yet I have done so since January: I requested accommodations for additional, earlier lab sections and for options to exit the lab early so that I might still be able to partake in our communal iftars and prayers. But the fruits of my labor — the permission I have since received to break my fast for a predetermined period of less than twenty minutes in a side room in the lab — are rotting. They reduce the spiritual richness and complexity of Ramadan to a transaction of food and drink and entirely distort the obligations of my religion as a loss in productivity and in caliber as a pre-medical student at Harvard. To reconcile lab and Ramadan, it seems, is code for reconciling being at Harvard and being Muslim. These scars of unbelonging for Muslims are inscribed far and wide around Harvard’s campus. The soul of this issue lives not only in organic chemistry labs, but also in Harvard’s very foundation — in the small and poorly-lit lone prayer hall Harvard cast aside for its hundreds of Muslim students in thebasement of a freshman dormitory, or in theonly two permanent Halal meal stationsacross 12 undergraduate Houses for which Muslim students must compete. I once believed that our requests for belonging were grueling demands, as if my Muslim identity somehow strained and exhausted a corporation thatgrew $11.3 billion during a pandemic— the very pandemic that made me a virtual student last spring and my memories of a communal Ramadan feel like shards from a distant past. I once believed that erecting a Muslim prayer space comparable to the impressively-towering presence of Memorial Church, that offering Halal dining stations in each undergraduate House, or that extending accommodations for a religious practice observed bynearly two billion adherentswould be too taxing on Harvard. I once believed that when it came to institutional support for the expression of my identity, I should settle. But the boundary between accepting the status quo and reimagining a better, more just future is porous — and it requires crossing. Muslims at Harvard will not be content to break our fasts with the crumbs of visibility this institution affords us. We need — and we expect — this University to mobilize itself in our support, to lift the burden of hoping for more that we Muslims too often shoulder and to finally do more for us. So, as I break my fast in my organic chemistry lab tonight, I will pray to live that future, for myself and for the rest of my Muslim community. Sameer M.

thetech_mit_2022_39,"I’m an MIT AeroAstro student, and I look at the sky daily. This is relaxing, bringing optimism and motivation: I know that I can predict various phenomena in the universe and put the forces of nature to humanity’s use, to the best of my ability. I like to observe the physical interactions in our surrounding environment, because careful consideration of the processes within it allows one to clearly foresee world states and trajectories and make higher-value decisions in most situations. Our world has many interesting and observable patterns and tendencies. Among them I consider the evolution of life-forms and their habitats to be of paramount importance, especially in the context of global warming. One essential aspect that apparently eludes the reasoning of many is the physical space that the biosphere exists in: this is the main constraint dictating the resources available for life to persist, evolve, and expand, of which matter composition, thermodynamic conditions, and energy fluctuations are the most important. When addressing global warming, in recent years, many decision-makers have tended to focus only on “bandaging the Earth.” While the development of new technologies that would allow us to pollute less is definitely economically feasible and beneficial for the planet, instead, politicians often support anti-industrial social movements, allowing these movements to gain momentum and popularity. Think of the anti-nuclear energy movement in Germany, or movements to reduce industrial production or extractive industry activity in the U.S. (hurting businesses and workers . Think of public opinion on space exploration and colonization, that they are too expensive and too far in the realm of “science fiction” to be even remotely feasible. These are naive perspectives not supported by scientific fact and are usually promoted by those with a narrow vision of the world. Obviously I consider the idea of reducing our industrial activities overall without starting new ones to be absurd. Considering economical aspects, even social tension phenomena would be generated through taking uncalculated decisions. From my perspective, the global development of fission and fusion plants in addition to research in the field of nuclear energy are essential to our sustainable evolution as a highly technological civilization. High energy levels and rates are requirements for traveling throughout the solar system, processing matter, and ultimately either terraforming celestial objects or creating purely antropic environments (artificial bodies . These energy levels and rates are attainable with the strong nuclear force. At the level of the social conscience, by following lines of thought without making use of reason, we are physically limiting not only our horizons, but that of other living beings. We also have to take care of a biosphere often neglected by most members of the human species. The reality is that we are the highest on the trophic chain and have the most developed conscience. Science gathers knowledge much faster than humanity gains wisdom. Polluting an entire planet, causing a mass extinction, and not taking serious action towards finding a new home in space don’t seem reasonable. Actions are being taken in many highly developed countries to protect the planet through technological modernization of industry. However, in order to maintain an equilibrium between the development of our different fields of knowledge as a species, we must also take action in other scientific fields including, but not limited to, space exploration, human habitat extension onto the moon and Mars, and genetic engineering for accelerated evolution and disease prevention. Moreover, without guidance at a high level of society, there is plenty of room after the pandemic for the youth to find escape through libertinage, hedonism, political violence, and many other things. Values in each nation are projected by prominent individuals, so when the dominant classes are not setting reasonable ideals for society, the social organism may end up evolving slowly, chaotically, or even backwards. If you are a true leader, you must provide a sense of purpose and meaning to others. Otherwise, you are just a demagogue using cheap rhetoric and immoral acts for the purpose of maintaining your position of power. I prefer societal lines of evolution in which we are looking at and reaching for the sky with the purpose of expanding our habitat and that of Earth’s biosphere while understanding what in the past would have been deemed “secrets of the universe.” This idea is well-documented at a hypothetical level in science fiction books such as those by Issac Asimov or Frank Herbert. Wasn t it always our dream to fly? If you look into the past, the gods from our mythologies were navigating the seas of the skies and heavens. Whether you’re religious or atheist, looking at the sun, moon, stars, and beyond gives you a sense of power and intimacy with nature itself. This was felt even by our prehistoric ancestors who used the sun’s position relative to stars to calculate agricultural cycles. We should especially feel this intimacy today as humans prepare to occupy the near solar system. Only nations capable of highly organized and scientifically founded planning of their collective efforts will be true leaders at global level: they will become the most influential at the interplanetary level, silently leaving others somewhere behind in history. Preparation for space exploration is motivating for some individuals, including myself. We are lucky: technologically, we already have the resources and ability to colonize space. We have the technology to transport materials for colonies on the moon and to bring equipment to Mars for a self-sustaining city, with enough people eager to be pioneers and explore these new frontiers. We have the materials, the software and hardware. It is mostly a lack of will that separates us from the vision described by Elon Musk as comparable to the fleet of one thousand ships sent to the shores of Ilion, under the leadership of Agamemnon. If no action is taken to fix the lack of willpower, especially from political leaders, we will likely enter a stagnant phase in our evolution as a civilization. Insufficient resources on an overpopulated planet will lead to economic tension and conflicts. We are not confined to a single planet. We are the generation of the space age, and we have great chances to make life multiplanetary. What I and others ask our leaders to do is to support high-caliber projects that will mobilize all of humanity in a collaborative effort. We think of individuals like President John F. Kennedy, who started the most demanding space program on the planet and said clearly that we “choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.” Sadly enough, these visionary leaders often have fates similar to that of Prometheus. Regardless, we must look into the future with hope and be determined in using our strength to win. We already have gifted people across the planet willing to help scatter humanity across the universe, we have much of the technology developed, and we definitely have the economic basis to support this endeavor. It will be just a matter of ratios of various means and forces across the planet whether we achieve a higher level of social conscience and global collaboration. Knowledge and reason are the foundation of our strength. Codrin Paul Oneci ’21 is a first-year Master of Science student in AeroAstro."

The first one is from St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican City, and there are totem poles and old articles from residential schools. The second one is Westminster Abbey in London, with Northern Lights, handprints in the circle detailing and shoes out front. The final one is of the Siena Cathedral in Italy with beaded earring details and current(ish articles about the unmarked graves. My great grandfather was a residential school survivor, but was also a very proud Catholic man who found solace in his relationship with God. I, on the other hand, did not grow up religious in any sense. I have had countless conversations with my grandmother about my anger towards the Church for what they have done to Indigenous communities and how it has influenced our family, but it is always met with a heavy sigh and a “it’s more complicated than that.” The bottom line is it is complicated. Of course, the anger towards the Church is completely justified, but this raises a lot of internal struggles for Indigenous peoples that grew up Catholic, which is what I want to emphasize in this piece — the beauty, the anger, the mourning and the re-emergence.

Ned Chambers received his B.S. in human biology in 1973. He recently retired from a neighborhood family medical practice in San Diego. Neither belonged to a housed fraternity while at Stanford. In her opinionpiecepublished Apr. 27, former undergraduate Alex Young (a founding member of Abolish Stanford Greek questions why only Greek organizations deserve campus housing over what she contends are 650+ open membership clubs on campus. Her suggestion is that because members of these other organizations do not have the option to stay multiple years in their residences, nobody should have that option. We argue that instead of ending this option for the fewer than 500 students who now benefit, it should be expanded to all students. Acknowledging a housing shortage, the original row houses were built by Greek alumni to meet a severe housing shortage for undergraduates. In response, alumni raised what would be tens of millions in today’s dollars to assist the University in housing undergraduates. The organizations that did so raised funds that both increased the undergraduate housing supply and allowed the organization’s students to be housed. In the 1960s, Greek alumni were approached again and encouraged to abandon their Row houses to build even more student housing on the Knoll and by Lake Lagunita. They were once again asked to be the principal funders of new undergraduate housing. One group, Sigma Chi (550 Lasuen , rejected the offer, but continues to maintain their own property under a lease with the University, paying a 6-figure ground lease rent and performed a multi-million dollarrenovationin 2006. Ms. Young’s proposed solution to what she perceives as an inequity is the opposite of what ought to be University policy. The real solution here is not taking away the option of multi-year housing from the fewer than 500 students in those residences; it is offering that type of housing toallstudents who want it. While Ms. Young cites statistics that are several years old, this spring’s rush tells us how dramatically undergraduate housing demand has increased in the years since Ms. Young was an undergraduate. As one example, over 435 Stanford men rushed fraternities this year, according to our conversations with the IFC. Only about 200 received bids. We estimate that less than half of them will be able to live in a Greek residence next year. Sorority rush this spring saw similar numbers. 396 students rushed sororities; 254 received bids. Demand was also way up for students rushing groups in the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC and African-American Fraternal & Sororal Association (AAFSA . Given strong demand, the University should find ways to add more Greek housing options rather than removing existing housing. Approximately a thousand students (versus a freshman class of 2,350 wanted to join Greek lettered organizations this spring. The housed Greek organizations draw the greatest interest. These students likely want to live in multi-year housing largely to develop thecloserrelationships and lifetime bondscreatedin such an environment. Based on our assessment of housing capacity, we estimate that the 10 houses now assigned to Greek organizations can hold just under 500 students. This spring’s rush suggests that there’s demand for Greek housing by as many as 3300 students, given a spring rush of 831 multiplied by four class years. A more conservative estimate might put this number around 2500 — still five times the available supply. Ms. Young contends that this dynamic is unfair. What she does not share, and presumably does not know, is that it is Greek alumni who for at least 15 years have lobbied the University to dramatically expand this housing option to all students. Given the lack of similar housing options for non-Greek students, it is evidently the Office of Student Affairs that stubbornlyresistsdoing so. The University should be meetingdemandby either increasing the supply of Greek residences or letting all other student organizations and students have an opportunity to live in an expanded pool of similar residences. Instead of placing blame with the Office of Student Affairs, Ms. Young contends there is “only one explanation for all this: donor influence.” She claims it is “well known that Greek alumni donate more to their universities than non-Greek alumni.” She asserts that Greek alumni tend to be the “wealthiest and the most powerful alumni.” Whether Ms. Young’s claim that the University’s most successful alumni are Greek is accurate or not, it is undisputed that Greek alumni do contribute significantly more at most schools, including Stanford. There is a reason. Ms. Young’s linked documents establish that students in Greek life are more likely to say they formed relationships with mentors and professors, were more active in extracurricular activities and had better access to internships. All of these positive outcomes are the necessary by-product of the relationships and lifetime bonds that are created by living with a diverse group of roughly 50 individuals from different class years for multiple years in thesameStanford residence. Alumni who strongly bond with their university as a student will be more bonded as an alum. They volunteer more. They give more. Stanford would do a service to all its students (and its endowment by dramatically increasing the housing stock devoted to multi-year living options for all students and organizations. Let supply rise to meet the overwhelming demand. Stanford has formed a new task force to see how to restore fun to the campus. One solution is to make everybody happy with their housing options, instead of making everyone equally unhappy as Ms. Young proposes.

With finals week coming up and all the stress that comes with it, students should not be pulling all-nighters. It damages our brain function, and it is not an effective way to study for finals. Although theMain Libraryis open 24/7 starting April 30 for finals, students should not stay all night to cram study for finals. According toMedical News Today, 20% of college students pull an all-nighter every month and 35% stay up past 3 a.m. at least one night every week.Studieshave shown that students who pull all-nighters regularly have lower GPAs, have experienced more sleep deprivation and make more mistakes than those who do not stay up all night. The lack of sleep is asdamagingto one’s academic performance as extreme alcohol and drug use. Pulling all-nighters throughout the semester also takes a toll on one’s mental health. Completing all-nighters consistently can lead to sleep deprivation. Because of sleep deprivation, one can become more stressed due to anincreasein cortisol levels, which is the stress hormone. According to theNational Library of Medicine, “Increased anxiety levels have been widely recognized as one of the most important consequences of sleep deprivation.” Sleep deprivation can also be a more significant mental health issue like insomnia or depression. Consistent all-nighters can also take effect on one’s physical health. Sleep deprivation canleadto high blood pressure, type-2 diabetes, weight gain and heart disease. No sleep canalsodecrease energy, increase fatigue and increasepain sensitivity.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_13,"In June 2021, President Bidensaidthat it has been difficult to get “Latinx” people vaccinated because they are fearful of being “deported.” Biden’s sentiment is shockingly racist, with his usage of the term “Latinx” being the ironic, insensitive cherry on top. The term “Latinx” is intended to function as an all-encompassing, gender-neutral version of “Hispanic” or “Latino.” Given the continued rising profile ofnonbinarygender identities, it’s more important than ever to normalize language that emphasizes inclusion for nonbinary people. The intentions behind the term “Latinx” are well-meaning, but its usage is not as beneficial to the community it was intended for as it seems. In fact, in a June-July 2021 Galluppollthat asked Hispanic adults to choose a preferred term, 57% of them selected “Hispanic” and 37% chose “Latino,” while only 5% picked “Latinx.” In this way, it’s clear that “Latinx” has been largely rejected by the Hispanic community. The term “Latine” is a stronger option that achieves the goals of gender inclusivity more effectively than “Latinx” does. Changing one letter may seem like a minor difference, but in comparison to “Latine,” “Latinx” is disconnected from the Spanish language and dehumanizing. Replacing the “x” with the “e” also makes “Latine” feel more natural. Additionally, “Latinx” has been thoroughlymockedfor the ironic fact that it is awkward to pronounce in Spanish. “Latine” is pronounced similarly to its gendered counterparts: “lat-een.” Its adoption also enables a monumentous shift towards nonbinary inclusion in the Spanish language. In Spanish, adjectives are gendered to indicate whether someone is masculine or feminine, but using ”Latine” as a gender-neutral term would pave the way for non-binary people to be represented correctly. A tall nonbinary person could be described as “alte” in the same way that a tall man is described as “alto.” When nonbinary people were gaining mainstream attention in America, there wasbacklashalong with claims that using “they” or “them” to refer to a singular person would be too confusing. In reality, it’s as easy as referring to somebody as “they” instead of a gendered pronoun like “she.” Using “Latine” and adjusting the endings of gendered adjectives to “e” would be a similarly trouble-free way to properly reference nonbinary people. At the same time, “Hispanic” is an acceptable, inclusive term, as long as it’s correctly used to refer to someone from a Spanish-speaking country. As a half-Mexican man myself, I also understand that “Latino” does not inherently exclude women or nonbinary people. This doesn’t mean the Spanish language cannot adapt to reflect the major changes in how our society views gender in modern times. Other options like “Latino/a” and “Latin@” are not only even more impossible to pronounce, but fail to provide the gender inclusivity of the previously mentioned terms. Terms like “Latin@” erase non-binary identities — it’s like saying “his or hers” instead of simply saying “theirs.” Using either of these terms is more difficult than using “Latinx.” At this point, non-Hispanic peoples’ usage of “Latinx” is performative due to its high unpopularity with Hispanic people themselves. People like Biden and academic institutions thatcontinueto use “Latinx” do so in an attempt to project a socially conscious image, but are actually displaying their lack of awareness on the issue. “Latine” is a better gender-neutral alternative, but it seems that the non-Hispanic people who use “Latinx” are too disconnected from the Hispanic community to realize it.

But, Senate can often be hard to understand for the average student, andthe agenda docketcan be super long and dull to read. Senate Recentredis written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month. Here’s what to expect at the October 19 Senate meeting. This will be the first UBC Vancouver Senate meeting with our new chair, interim UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Dr. Deborah Buszard. As the acting president and vice-chancellor, Buszard will be chairing the meeting, confirming items approved by the Board of Governors that were previously approved in Senate and approving candidates for degrees effective November 2022. The Senate Admissions Committee is bringing forward a motion to remain test-optional for undergraduate US applicants. The SAT and ACT became optional during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this motion would extend this permanently for the future. This motion being brought by the Senate Admissions Committee will extend the Master of Occupational Therapy Distributed Program to the Fraser Health region, which will help to“better meet the healthcare needs”of the Fraser Valley. If approved, the program will have two cohort sites: the North Cohort at the University of Northern British Columbia and the Fraser Valley Cohort at UBC Surrey. The Senate Teaching and Learning Committee will be presenting their Final Report on Student Experience of Instructions (SEI Survey Recommendations. In May 2020, the Student Evaluations of Teaching Working Group presented a report to the Senate with 16 recommendations. Currently, 9 of the 16 initial recommendations are complete, with 3 in progress, 3 ongoing and 1 labeled as being within the Senate s purview. Work that will continueincludes progressingin “investigating and testing automated systems for analyzing text comments,” a “dual-campus working group… to develop Senate policies for evaluation of teaching” and “regular analyses of SEI data done by Planning and Institutional Resource Office (PAIR , including for bias”. A motion proposing changes for eligibility of membership in the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies (FGPS . These changes will clarify their membership criteria and limit membership by making Educational Leadership (EL Faculty ineligible. EL Faculty include Professors, Associate Professors, and Assistant Professors of Teaching. EL Faculty has high representation of many equity-seeking groups who will now be actively excluded from FGPS within UBC Policy if this motion passes. If you are in LFS, the Senate Academic Policy Committee is bringing forth revisions regarding the faculty’s promotion and standing for approval this Wednesday. If passed, criteria for academic standing will no longer depend on the number of credits you are enrolled in for the winter session. Good academic standing will be sessional averages 60 per cent or greater, and academic probation will be sessional averages greater than 50 per cent but below 60 per cent. Students will have failed standing status if they either reach a sessional average below 50 per cent or if they meet conditions for academic probation two sessions in a row. The Academic Policy Committee is motioning to allow, in specific circumstances, supplemental examinations in the Flexible Doctor of Pharmacy program (PharmD — which are currently not allowed. Another motion, brought by the Admissions Committee, seeks to suspend admission to this program effective for the 2023 Winter Session onwards. The materials state that all students currently in the PharmD program will be supported through to graduation. The PharmD program is intended for current pharmacists who wish to further their careers while also working part or full time.

stanforddaily_2022_110,"One insecurity I think about often is my wobbly foundation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math subjects. I didn’t grow up with a sustained interest in Legos or RC (remote-controlled, radio-controlled cars. I was always more occupied with perfecting my nail art skills, shoddily designing the next couture dress of my dreams and crafting anything and everything. My interests expanded as I grew older, but I became more self-conscious and regretful of the childhood hobbies I filled my downtime with, increasingly feeling that the activities I liked were girly and “non-engineer-ey.” Though these choices of activity should not inherently limit anyone’s ability or aptitude towards their profession or interests, the fact that I often doubted the validity of my interests and identity threatened my chances of staying in a STEM profession. Our society systemically differentiates between girl and boy activities — a quick google search for “toys for boys” brings up “robots & robotic pets,” “vehicle, trains & remote control toys” and “building sets & blocks” while the first eight results in searching “toys for girls” includes either “dolls,” “accessories” or “clothes.” Whether or not girls truly have these preferences, society has long viewed the interests and activities of girls through a certain lens — one which does not correlate strongly with our society’s description of engineer/scientist — and it’s become increasingly important to instill a level of confidence in girls to continue making these stereotype-breaking choices once they identify STEM as a potential interest. So what can we do to remove these self-doubts for women in STEM? How can we instill a confidence in them so that whoever they become and whatever they’re interested in is extremely valuable and valid? How can we help them craft an identity which should not shake the validity of their choice to embark in the STEM profession? We can facilitate this through a number of initiatives. Extracurricular STEM programs early on in life have been cited as one technique forincreasingthe number of women majoring in STEM disciplines. These STEM programs have the freedom to take on numerous forms, as they must focus on a wide range of early ages; between the ages of 6 and 18, girls’ interest in STEMdecreasesfrom 66% to 4%. Additionally,researchshows that subject choices by classroom peers affect girls’ preference for STEM subjects; when their female peers do not have a preference for STEM subjects, other girls are less encouraged to display these preferences for fear of violating gender norms. Not only do these extracurricular programs allow girls to perform better in STEM because they provide exposure to these subjects earlier on, but finding these communities can also help them know, and believe, that they belong. Breaking the stereotype is uncomfortable: most girls make the choice toveer awayfrom STEM subjects when seeing more boys choose STEM activities. Some girls will even “underperform in tasksin which they have to ‘think like scientists’” because they already associate thinking like a scientist with a masculine trait. Girls as young as age 6 begin toharbor ideasthat STEM is meant for males; exposing them to communities of other girls who choose STEM can help to combat this preconceived notion. Some programs include Girls Who Code, a nonprofit organization aiming to increase the number of women in computer science, and STEM for Her, a non-profit foundation promoting education and providing opportunities for girls to pursue successful STEM-related careers. These programs have proven highly effective in influencing undergraduate majors down the line — Girls Who Code reported its participants to study computer science in college at15 to 16 times the national average. Educating adults who have a significant impact on a child’s early years can also help solidify a girl’s sense of belonging in STEM areas. A large percentage of adults harbor a number of biases such as believing STEM subjects like mathematics require a natural ability and arefixed-skills. Additionally, parents unintentionally reinforce gender stereotypes when theyoverestimate their sons and underestimate their daughters, unconsciously choose to process praise (a type of praise that emphasizes the work, effort or actions of a child their sonsmore oftenand believe thatdaughters must try harder than sonsto succeed in subjects such as mathematics. Considering a 2013studywhich found that parents’ praise to 1-3 year-olds was predictive of their children’s motivational frameworks five years later, early adult interactions seem to have made solid contributions to the gender disparity in STEM. Additionally, the impact of more female role models cannot be overlooked. The fact that STEM roles are often portrayed as men’s jobs or associated with more male-dominated culture and activities may deter females from discovering a passion for STEM or envisioning a sustained interest in the field for themselves. Personally, inspiring female role models have played a huge part in keeping me in STEM, from Gwynne Shotwell to Hedy Lamarr, especially because I have been able to see more of my diverse passions represented in their work, reminding me that I am as much an engineer as the boy next to me. Thisfeelingis generally true for other girls; when girls come into contact with female role models in STEM, and more broadly, individuals with whom they can identify, their self-concept in STEM, attitude toward STEM and motivation to pursue STEM careers improve. It’s unfortunate that a boy playing with his toys may be seen as a curious kid with an aptitude for tinkering and problem solving, whilst all the times I diagnosed my sewing machine in order to continue my fashion projects were seen just as a feminine hobby. Though it will take generations to combat the years of subtle reinforcement of gender stereotypes in STEM, priming a girl early on for STEM can give her the confidence and knowledge to sustain her STEM choices and provide her with the best possible chance of staying true to her professional dreams.

ubyssey_2022_28,"May 9, 2022 Written byStephanie Okoli In the latest forBlack Voices at UBC, Stephanie Okoli has written a collection of letters and poems that follow a young girl through childhood. Hi God, My mom told me if you love something more than God, you should sacrifice it. So, I got rid of Blankie for you. He was my best friend, my confidant, my partner-in-crime. We did everything together. He was Boots to my Dora. He stayed in my backpack when it was time for class. I only brought it to school once, though. Mom and Remi say I should be a big girl. I’m ten and puberty hit me like a truck. You gave me pimples, boobs and armpit hair. So now I give you Blankie. His final resting place is the blue shed at the side of our house. Now that I’ve given you Blankie, I, of course, am going to need some things in return. My pastor said if you give to God, he’ll send blessings in return. First thing first, I need a new Nintendo D.S Lite. Can it be Black like my old one? I tried to sell my first one, but I broke it instead. I took out the battery and was going to sell them separately to Matthew Mattia. He didn’t know it was going to be sold separately and now hates me, but business is business. He broke it on the tarmac under the basketball net. It would be great if I could get it for Christmas or my birthday. The next thing on my list is an iPod touch. Everyone at church has one. We are all the body of Christ and should be treated equally, right? Right, good. Christmas or birthday. I would separate these gifts, though. I don’t want my mom getting suspicious. I assume that all this stuff is gonna come through here and I don’t want my mom second-guessing her good deeds. The last thing is a phone. Now, if you want, you can replace the iPod with the phone, I don’t mind. I like the Samsung S3. I’m Team Android all day. Plus, if I get an iPod, I can have the best of both worlds. I know this is a lot… actually, nevermind. You parted the Red Sea and made Jesus walk on water! A Samsung is nothing. Anyways, thanks for listening. Sincerely, Stephanie Hello God, I need a new best friend, but it seems like all the best friends are taken. Joy was my first choice. We run ‘buy me McDonald’s’ schemes during my mom’s choir practice, so it only seems fitting that we jump into the next phase in our relationship. But, she’s best friends with Ariana. Abi was my second choice, by the way. I met Abi before Joy and we share a deep connection. We only meet on Sundays, but our bond strengthened due to my comedic nature. They both laugh at my jokes but don’t want to be my best friends. I want a best friend that’s as funny as me. I want her to laugh at my jokes and I want us to talk about everything. She has to be a girl, of course. My mom would act like I was getting married if I had a boy best friend. I can imagine my mom screaming, “Stephy, where’s your husband?” She can be real annoying sometimes. I pray that she makes me laugh and is kind. I want us to talk on the phone all the time and share secrets with one another. She can be from anywhere too — Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia — I don’t care. As long as we share a love forSuper Mario 64, I’m down for whatever. She doesn’t need a D.S. We can share mine. Well, I mean, she can use mine. She can’t take it home or something. And we can’t share mine unless I get a new one for Christmas. Or my birthday. I wonder what she’ll look like. Will she be tall? Maybe she’ll like basketball. God, make her like basketball! I don’t watch it all the time, but it’s fun to play. I’d show her all my favourite TV shows,The Fresh Prince,Everybody Hates ChrisandMy Wife And Kids. She probably already knowsThat’s So RavenandThe Proud Family. I want her to be the Carlton to my Will. I’d like to meet her soon, please. Not having a best friend is tiresome. I want us to have matching braids and cornrows. I want them covered in jewels and beads. They might scratch our faces when we run and play, but that’s okay. Thanks for listening Stephanie You are the Am that I Am, The Beginning and the End. How I worship You I kneel before You in splendour, and gaze upon Your throne. Yahweh!I call You answer me with horns, And serenade me with trumpets I dance before the angels A smile graces Your face How I love Thee The only Father I’ve ever known Your warmth surrounds me As Your light brightens the shadows And Your voice beams through the noise Hosanna When I speak, You listen. You’ve always been close. I recite your ways And heed your words I do my best to obey. I know you’ll never leave me. I know you’ll never forsake me. For your words hold truth. Thank you for this day Thank you for the birds chirping and blue skies. You made the clouds swirl together, perfect ivory. I sit on a stoop, taking it all in. I watch the squirrels run up and down the trees. Laughing at the sight of them fighting for nuts and pine cones. The screams of children fill my ears They race around the park, Leaping off the swing sets, trying to fly. The men play soccer The field becomes their sanctuary The women cheering on the side become their choir. Go! Go! Go! I catch my fellow teenagers dancing from the corner of my eye. They rehearse their TikTok dances in the parking lot. The sun bounces off their skin, Giving them a radiant glow. The homeless man laughs with his friends. They pitch a tent in the corner. They slap the mosquitoes as they land on the bare skin. I stretch myself across the grassy floor And think of the ways you’ve been good to me. Dear God, There are two Canadas. One of vigour and one of isolation. My joints pop as I’m stretched between the two. I’m sent down the path of the broken because of the colour of my skin. My lack of money keeps me there. But, my birthright makes its way to me, education. It holds me and equips me with the grace to tell Black Canada’s story, And show the world my own. Dear God, My ancestors are struck by the master’s whip. Their flesh burns under the southern sun. Where were you when all this was happening? Where was our Moses? Marie Angelique’s leg was crushed by the Brodequin. Through the pain, she confessed to the crime. But what crime was that Father? Setting fire to Old Montreal was her birthright, Her right of passage. Where was her Red Sea? I’m told to get over it. “It was a long time ago,” Mother says. Our lineage stayed in Nigeria, so my mother’s sympathy is thin. But I can’t get over it. Where were you? Dear God, I’m mad at you. You knew how Africans would find out about Your Word, and You let it happen. You’re supposed to hope, but instead, You aided in Africa’s destruction. I wonder about the Israelites. How they were enslaved under Pharaoh for hundreds of years. You brought them from their destruction and positioned them to be Your Holy people. You led them to the promised land as a cloud in the day and a torch in the night. Why couldn’t You do the same for us? Was it because we were pagans and had to be taught a lesson? You left us to suffer, and we’ve been suffering ever since. I think of my mother, who douses herself with bleach cream to get ready to enter your holy sanctuary every Sunday. She’s already light-skinned, but she itches for more; she chases after whiteness. Do you know how that makes me feel? The foundation of my life succumbs to the frail image of western beauty as she adjusts her favourite blonde wig. Are you happy with her? Are you satisfied with us? Yours truly, Stephanie Okoli What are we now, dear Lord? Your distant, You don’t talk to me anymore. I guess that’s fitting since I pushed you away. I did it in anger, fury. You left my people to die. You were never supposed to forsake me. I want us to start over. I want to love You. Dear God, We’re life partners. I get that now. It was hard to see you or feel you before. The aching sensation of regret and pain flowed out of me during prayer. I could never reach you like I did before. Our connection was broken. The thing that mended our severed lifeline was trust. When my back was against the wall, I cried out to you, and you opened my eyes. You showed me Your plan for me. I demonstrated that you haven’t forgotten me. So, I stretch my arms out to You and smile. I sense your embrace. You’ve given me a new Blankie and new friends. You’ve given my mom a new direction in life. Thank you. Sincerely, Stephanie Okoli Black Voices at UBCis an open-form column publishing work by Black writers in UBC’s student community.

rice_thresher_2022_34,"ByShifa Abdul-Rahman4/19/22 11:02pm ​​Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. In January, the Rice Board of Trustees announced plans to move the Founder’s memorial to another area of the academic quad as part of a whole redesign, adding additional context of his “entanglement” with slavery. This comes despite continual calls from the student body to not have the enslaver displayed in the quad regardless of the context provided. It would be just for these calls to action and the majority of the Task Force Committee who voted to not keep it there that the Board of Trustees decide to not keep the memorial prominently displayed in the quad at all. To provide an analogy, a welcome sign exists at the entrance of the titular town of “Schitt’s Creek,” depicting the founder Horace Schitt at a river with his sister bent over in a sexually suggestive position right in front of him. The main protagonist, Charlie Rose, criticized this sign, rightfully imploring the mayor of the town, Roland Schitt, to take it down and make a new sign. Schitt assures Rose that the problem will be resolved. The next day however, Rose goes by the sign with his family and there they see an additional sign constructed beside it saying “Don’t worry, she’s his sister.” Rather than addressing the issue of the signs content in today’s context, the mayor performatively added an incomplete description of what’s depicted to make it seem commendable. And Rice’s redesign has the potential to equally misconstrue history if it isn’t already at that point now. This becomes more than evident of an ongoing problem that we see: The student body deserves an administrative body that is held accountable to their needs. The most outrageous aspect of the decision is the reasoning that the Board of Trustees used to keep the statue in the quad: Philanthropy. We must be critical of the figures that are considered philanthropists and what enables one to identify as a philanthropist. In the case of William Marsh Rice, the Board of Trustees has determined that writing up a university to be built is enough to excuse the Black bodies that he has exploited and the Black families that he has torn apart. I assure you that his philanthropy is not enough to excuse keeping his presence in the quad as a reminder for the Rice Black community of their historical exclusion. The Sackler family similarly practiced philanthropy through providing the funds for art collections in prominent museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Louvre. However these institutions, after learning of their prominent role in fueling the opioid epidemic, rightfully decided to remove their family name from their exhibits and wings. If these institutions recognize the wrongs of imparting opioids across the nations to such an extent that they remove the names of those responsible, then we should expect this university to recognize the wrongs of degrading and exploiting Black life to such an extent that they would remove the statue from the quad it’s in. While it is progress to decenter the statue, this compromised decision fails to center the marginalized on this campus and instead revises the narrative to make the university administration into the heroes of this story. As I now have reflected on this decision as a soon-to-be graduate, the words of Mariame Kaba have given me comfort. She wrote a letter to the organizers of the #NoCopAcademy movement who unfortunately couldn’t deter Chicago from constructing a police training academy next to a school. She encouraged the organizers in the aftermath by writing, “I choose to emphasize the fact that you fought as a win because what we choose to emphasize determines our lives. Your protest, your refusal to be run over, your local actions, added to those of others the world over, will slowly tilt this world toward more justice.” I want us to remember this most of all after this decision: when we continue to organize against structural and systemic racism, we will continue to win. So keep organizing. Keep raising awareness on issues that affect us all and don’t stop the fight. While I am now going to move into my position as the Campaign Director for the Convict Leasing and Labor Project, continuing the fight to protect and preserve the Sugarland 95 burial site from being whitewashed, the #DownWithWilly movement is far from over. For everyone that has joined the #DownWithWilly movement thus far in whatever capacity, I express nothing but gratitude. Thank you for your persistence, your dedication, your love and your power. Thank you for all of the roles that you have taken on in service of the movement, whether large or small. Finally, thank you for continuing the fight for the removal of the memorial from the academic quadrangle after I leave. It provides me with the hope that the future of this university’s student body will be in good hands. Thank you. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_30,"Some say that any press is good press — but not for Harvard Business School this semester. This fall, South Korean national broadcast network JTBCreportedon the distorted misrepresentation of Japan’s 1910 to 1945 colonization of Korea in HBS’s core curriculum. The distortion in question involves an HBS-published case titled“Korea,”required reading in a required class for second-semester MBA students. The “Korea” case is sparking controversy for attributing Korea’s modernization to brutal imperial Japanese rule. It is for this reason that Korean students at Harvard Kennedy School initiated astatementdemanding the case be revised by the time this class is taught next year to reflect on the realities of Japanese colonization of Korea in a more balanced manner. The statement was later signed by the wider Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Korea Society, and also covered by JTBC. Currently, the case takes the viewpoint of the colonizer, crediting South Korea’s development to illegal Japanese occupation. It notes that “Korea became increasingly industrialized, and transportation and power infrastructure improved” during the Japanese occupation, and that the Korean “educational, administrative, and financial systems were also modernized.” What the case fails to mention is that these very efforts to industrialize and build infrastructure in Korea were byproducts of the Japanese treatment of Korea as its military supply base in wars waged throughout Asia. The Japanese government subjected an estimated 1.2 million or more Koreans to murderous forced labor and up to an estimated 200,000 women to sexual slavery, to advance one such war in which they committed unspeakable war crimes like the Nanjing Massacre in China. It is a dangerous act of misinformation for the HBS case to laud this byproduct of industrialization without providing proper historical context as to its purpose and victims. The HBS case’s depiction of Korea under Japanese rule stands in stark contrast to the academic handling of similar situations. In 2022, it is rare to see India and Algeria’s development credited to British or French rule, respectively, without at least acknowledgment of the harm suffered under such rule. When it comes to these other nations, historians of the 21st century seem to understand the historical context well enough to distinguish byproducts of colonial ambitions from efforts to serve the native people by means of economic development. Unfortunately, the same does not hold for Korea and Japanese rule in HBS’s curriculum. It is true that the history of Japanese occupation in Korea has been the subject of great dispute between the two countries for decades. In sharp contrast to its wartime ally Germany, the Japanese government has made it clear over the last decades that they no longer intend to claim their war crimes against Korea. They continue to promote a narrative in front of the international community that masks their past abuses and argues for the positive impact of their colonization. Because of this dispute surrounding the history between these two nations, HBS’s depiction of Japan and Korea’s relationship is even more disappointing. In this contentious situation, HBS has chosen to uplift only one voice — that of the Japanese colonizer — rather than treading carefully to produce a fair, balanced characterization of a difficult piece of history. HBS’s uneven choice in the publication of the “Korea” case, in my opinion, points to deeper nefarious inclinations. As the statement argues, perhaps it is no coincidence that the group of six authors on the case includes a researcher from Harvard’s Japan Research Center visiting from a Japanese university, but no scholar from a Korean background. In addition, the statement alleges that this is not the first time HBS has faced public scrutiny for this case: Acording to its authors, numerous requests for revision from Harvard Business School students in the past have been repeatedly ignored by the school administration. Since the statement and JTBC report, the primary author of the case, HBS Professor Forest L. Reinhardt, has said over email communications to a protesting organization that they “expect to make editorial changes to future versions of this case.” While Reinhardt’s response is welcomed, it falls short of the concrete action and timeline Harvard GSAS Korea Society students called for in their initial statement. Moreover, we have yet to hear from HBS in any institutional capacity. It is unclear what Reinhardt’s private email correspondence, without the backing of a larger HBS body, means in practice, particularly regarding when and how the publication will be revised. As demanded by the statement, the harmful nature of the misrepresentation within the case warrants immediate action, before another MBA class of over 1,000 students engages with the publication in January of 2023. The effort of graduate students to rectify the historical distortion within this HBS case is larger than what some may view as a mere historical dispute between two nations. It is an effort to ensure accurate historical education in one of the world’s most distinguished educational institutions, and moreover, to decolonize historical education globally. Now that the case’s primary author has recognized its malignant flaws, it is only right for HBS to communicate when, how, and by whom the “editorial changes to future versions of this case” will be made — so that no future classes of HBS students need to engage with this same deleterious, one-sided depiction of history. Young Hyun Kim is a graduate of Harvard Kennedy School and an author of the statement demanding the revision of the “Korea” case."
thetech_mit_2022_15,"Like many in California, I am battling my local school board and the state Board of Education to maintain high quality standards in math, to keep calculus available to high school students, and to negate the idea that right answers and showing your work in math are examples of “white supremacy.” But MIT, who should have a major stake in theCalifornia Math Wars, is only making my job harder. It’s clear MIT should have an interest in this. Where California math standards go, the nation may well follow. MIT will suffer if America stops educating kids in math to a high level. We all will. What may be less clear is MIT’s role in this. MIT gave in to those who couldn’t tolerate Dorian Abbot because he held different views on how to achieve a greater diversity of teaching talent. One may agree with Abbot, or not. But what’s deeply troubling is to discover that no dissent is allowed. If the debate is framed as “equity” vs. “equality,” or how either of those might be advanced, there is no open debate. There is no marketplace of ideas. What is true of a speaker at MIT is true of a speaker at a school board meeting. Should math curricula be designed around equity or equality? Is it okay to achieve equity by removing calculus? Should we instead focus on equality of opportunity in grades 1–8? Or should our community focus on home zoning laws that determine who can live where and what school they can go to? These are important questions, deserving of debate. Debate could educate us all. But parents at a school board meeting see what happens when one argues against the prevailing orthodoxy. For every Dorian Abbot that MIT shuts down, not only do MIT professors have more fear of speaking out, but so do the rest of us. When elite institutions allow a political slogan, however appealing it may seem, to be a sign post that means “no debate allowed,” the message spreads to the rest of us. When the sign-post is then hung above math education, MIT is cutting off the hand that feeds it. America, California, and MIT all need to do better on issues of fairness, equity, and equality. But we can’t solve those problems if we can t speak freely, without fear. I urge MIT to take a stand for free speech. A first step would be to officially adopt the Chicago Principles. Until MIT does, I urge MIT alumni to join me in sending their annual alumni gifts to the University of Chicago instead. Gene McKenna ’92"
state_press_2022_40,"Mark Kelly and Katie Hobbs will protect labor laws, ensure that abortion will not be outlawed completely in the state of Arizona, and prevent higher-education cutbacks. The midterm elections brought some good news for supporters of abortion rights, immigrants, environmental activists, and union members among other groups, with Democrats Mark Kelly and Katie Hobbswinningkey races in the state. These wins signal potential improvements in the lives of ASU students. Kelly and Hobbs will protect labor laws, ensure that abortion will not be outlawed completely in the state of Arizona, and prevent higher-education cutbacks. In contrast, Kari Lake s dispute with Arizona PBS left many students and professors worried about the future of academic freedom at the University. READ MORE:ASU professors worry after Kari Lake threatens to clean up shop if elected Here is how these Democratic wins could impact the future of Arizona policy: Hobbs s and Kelly s wins could definitively clarify Arizona s uncertain abortion landscape. READ MORE:This is what we know about where abortion rights currently stand in Arizona Both Hobbs and Kelly were backed by NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood and the Feminist Majority PAC. Both condemned the Supreme Court s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and affirmed their support for a woman s right to choose. Following the ruling, Hobbs vowed to veto unabashedly any further restrictions on access to reproductive health care as governor. Now that she has assumed office, the chances of the ban being reinstated are slim. Hobbs is an important last resort to any further attempts at banning abortion in Arizona. However, Kelly s role is much more reduced on the national level. In order to codify the right to abortion into law, Democrats would need to overturn the filibuster, requiring 60 votes. Although Democrats control the Senate, they lack the votes. This means that the power of Kelly s singular vote won t push progressive abortion protections through the Senate. Therefore, it seems unlikely that abortion will be recognized as a constitutional right. However, having pro-choice politicians in office indicates the possibility of a brighter, clearer future for abortion rights. Hobbs, in many ways, will serve as a roadblock to Republicans when it comes to education policy. But, all is not lost for her education policy goals, as there are paths for action. “The governor makes appointments to both the State Board of Education and the Arizona Board of Regents,” said Sherman Dorn, a professor at the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College at ASU. “I expect that over the next four years, Katie Hobbs will make a number of appointments to each body, and those are the direct policymaking bodies along with the legislature, so her influence will be indirect in terms of who she appoints to those boards,” Dorn said. According to Dorn, very little is likely to happen in terms of legislation, and the primary vehicle will be the state budget, both for higher education and K-12. As for the executive order, former Gov. Doug Ducey used it for education policy a few separate times. He issued an executive order to have all sex education curricula posted online for parents to review, along with an order that had kids return to in-person schooling. However, Dorn is more hesitant about the possibility of Hobbsusingthe executive order. “Katie Hobbs may choose to exercise her executive authority in a lot of areas; she hasn’t mentioned education, Dorn said. The one area she has mentioned is reproductive health rights. In terms of Kelly’s potential influence on education policy, his direct impact will likely be minimal, but his vote will be essential for other measures. “Keeping the Senate in Democratic hands means that President Biden can continue to appoint federal judges and get them confirmed, but it also means that all the other political appointees ... will also be able to be permanently appointed officials,” Dorn said. The opposition to Hobbs and Kelly presented an embodiment of thethreatof the right wing in the U.S. toward LGBTQ people in the country and around the world. Kari Lake and Blake Masters each attacked LGBTQ people, and those attacks have weight. Anti-LGBTQ violence has increased after anti-LGBTQ rhetoric increased. Lake and Masters were each defeated, which is certainly awinfor LGBTQ people. But both Hobbs and Kelly will be operating in a relatively difficult policy environment; Hobbs will have the GOP-controlled state legislature in her way, and Kelly will have the GOP-controlled House of Representatives to deal with. “I know that people are anticipating a continuation, if not an intensification, of anti-LGBTQ legislation being discussed, debated and perhaps even passed. So I do think that a significant role that Governor-elect Hobbs will likely play is being that defense against that kind of proposed or even passed legislation,” said Madelaine Adelman, a professor of Justice Studies at the School of Social Transformation. However, there are still positive actions that Hobbs and Kelly can take to protect and advance LGBTQ rights. “There’s a lot (Hobbs can do to make things easier for LGBT people … When we think about things like access to identity documents or legal services, those are really important things that can be addressed by a state agency policy,” said Jeanne Woodbury, the interim executive director at Equality Arizona. “If we think about access to healthcare, that’s something that can be addressed outside of the legislative process. Kelly’s election, on the other hand, provides a more clear path forward for legislation and a positive impact for LGBTQ people. His vote provides one of the 51 Senate votes the Democrats need in the Senate, and even though the Democrats no longer control the House, it is feasible to see a future where that is the reality. He can also cast votes to get federal judges on the bench who support LGBTQ people. “I’m anticipating that Senator Kelly will be able to represent the diverse interests that are found in our community,” Adelman said. Hobbs’ and Kelly’s wins also represent a brief sigh of relief from union members and working people around Arizona. Hobbs had thebackingof multiple Arizona labor unions, including the Arizona Education Association, which represented over 50,000 union members. Hobbs’ prospects for passing labor legislation may be limited, especially given that the legislature is controlled by the GOP, albeit by a slim margin in both the state House and Senate. She could utilize the executive order, but wide-ranging labor legislation is unlikely during her time in office. What she does concretely represent is a roadblock to serious anti-union legislation that may have been passed under Kari Lake, who was strongly anti-labor and picked fights, particularly with the teacher’s union. Her presence in the governor’s office for unions and working people was needed, especially with the threat that Lake brought to the table, and unions should pressure her to use all means necessary to advance pro-union legislation. Kelly’s win, on the other hand, likely signifies much of the same – for now. With the House of Representatives being held by Republicans, it will be hard for Kelly’s vote in the Senate to come down to much in terms of labor legislation. Outside of legislation, Kelly’s vote will be essential for positions confirmed by Senate votes, such as judges, which certainly has an effect on labor issues. President Biden has appointed dozens of federal judges throughout his time in office, and Kelly’s vote is nearly essential for those appointments to be approved. It is notable that Kelly had support from unions during his re-election campaign. He should be held accountable for union support, and labor leaders shouldpressurehim to carry forward pro-union legislation when the opportunity arises, as they have before. Hobbs’ and Kelly’s wins represent a step forward for Arizona’s immigration and border policy. Hobbs acknowledges the complexities of the crisis at the Arizona border without adopting inflammatory rhetoric toward undocumented immigrants. As governor, Hobbs seems determined to approve comprehensive immigration reform. She expressed interest in increasing staffing at ports of entry and preventing illegal drug trafficking across the border. Kelly shares this mindset. During his first term as Senator, he jointly introduced ameasureto increase Border Patrol pay and staffing and played an important part in closing gapsalong the U.S.-Mexico border. He also continues to advocate for investing in more technology and increasing the number of immigration judges to speed up case processing. Kelly’s willingness to break rapport with the Biden administration on border security, as well as his ongoingcriticismof Democrats’ understanding of border issues, may indicate that he could reach across the aisle to pass immigration legislation. However, both Kelly and Hobbs are only looking at one side of a multi-faceted issue, neglecting other border concerns like commerce and infrastructure. Sen. Kelly and Gov. Hobbs need to ensure that economic development and trade (with Mexico continues, said Irasema Coronado, the director of the School of Transborder Studies. I would also hope that they would take a look at environmental issues at the border that deal with infrastructure. Everyone thinks the border is about immigration and drugs, and it s not. There s more to it than that. Arizona’s water crisismakes environmental policy more crucial than ever. Kelly is backed by theLeague of Conservation Votersfor his “strong commitment to climate action”, so he will likely continue to support climate-related legislation. Given his bipartisan track record, cosponsoring legislation like theGrowing Climate Solutions Act, Kelly’s win is a tentative victory for Arizona s climate. Similarly, Hobbs prioritized tackling climate change while running for governor. She published aplandetailing how she will modernize Arizona s water infrastructure, mitigate wildfires and build a clean economy. Despite the party being known for its climate inaction, Republican politicians in Arizona tend to agree that water is a priority, with even Kari Lake and Blake Masters rolling out ideas for how to tackle the water crisis. This means that Hobbs could potentially convert her water policy goals into reality, given her promise of bipartisanship when she took office and her endorsement from GOP lawmakers across Arizona.

crimson_2022_135,"To the Classes of 2020 and 2021: Every Commencement is special, but yours is unique. The pandemic has delayed it for a year or two. In that same span of time, the country also faced a reckoning with racial justice in the wake of the murder of George Floyd in May 2020. The ramifications of that murder are still with us. George Floyd’s death forced the country to stop looking away from its legacy of racism. It is fitting, therefore, that Harvard has just issued a 132-pagereportdetailing the University’s involvement with slavery and other forms of racial discrimination during its almost 400-year-long history. The report makes for difficult but necessary reading, as it shows that Harvard was deeply complicit in one of the worst human rights abuses in history. We cannot undo the past, but we can confront it. And that’s what we have begun to do as a community. I hope that this, too, makes you proud. The University whose name shines brightly on your diploma and in the world has taken an important step to seek a fuller understanding of its history. As Harvard undergraduates, you have another reason to be proud: It was undergraduates who played an important role in making us reckon with our past. Almost 15 years ago, four students at Harvard College sat in Robinson Hall to begin a seminar on Harvard and Slavery. Little did they or their instructor know it would end with the University committing $100 million to begin to rectify its historical involvement with slavery. On that September day in 2007, we had no idea what we would find. Inspired by a courageous report issued by then Brown University President Ruth Simmons on Brown and slavery, these four students began excavating a history that had been hidden in plain sight for more than 150 years. They, and dozens of other students who took the seminar in subsequent years, discovered a university deeply entangled with slavery for the first 200-plus years of its existence. They wrote about Harvard presidents and faculty enslaving people and documented how profits from the slave economy funded Harvard’s early expansion; they discovered how Harvard suppressed debate about slavery and revealed how Harvard scientists perpetuated racist ideas. In 2011, with President Drew Faust’s support, their findings were published in a widely distributed report; they also they created awebsiteand offered a walking tour that traced slavery on Harvard’s campus. When the University’s first responses to these findings were underwhelming, the students demanded that the University meaningfully engage with its history and find ways to redress these past injustices. In 2016, President Drew Faust unveiled a plaque on Wadsworth house that commemorated some of the enslaved people who had been forced to labor there for Harvard presidents. That same year, the seal of the Law School — which until then had been inspired by the family seal of the school’s early donors, who were slave plantation owners — was abandoned. And in 2019, President Lawrence Bacow tasked a committee to write the report and issue the recommendations that came out last month. The students’ research laid the groundwork that made all this possible. Along the way, they taught us lessons that I hope will guide you as you leave campus and go out into the world. For one, they intuitively understood that the privileges afforded by Harvard’s unmatched resources and stellar reputation come with a responsibility to scrutinize its history, including the unsavory parts. And once they knew what was there, they made it public, suggesting that the University follow the sage advice of an 18th-century rabbi that “the secret of redemption is remembrance.” They reminded us that we can only build a better future if we are willing to confront our past. Second, the students focused on a local issue to confront a national, even global problem. The afterlives of slavery still stamp our politics, our patterns of inequality, and our institutions. With big issues, it can be hard to know where to start and what to do; the students remind us that we can always focus on the place, community, or institution that we find ourselves in. As the famous phrase puts it, we can think globally, and act locally. Third, the students acted. They knew something had to be done. They followed the advice of the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci who, while imprisoned by Mussolini, counseled that what we need is the “pessimism of the intellect, and the optimism of the will” — that is, to know the worst aspects of reality and nevertheless to act in a way that can change that reality. I hope that, after you graduate today, you will remember the lessons of this experience. Do something with the enormous privilege that is a Harvard education. Try to make the world a better place. Like the brave young woman who stood her ground and filmed George Floyd s murder, speak up. Be persistent and patient — you may fail the first time and succeed the next. Be stubborn. And get into trouble — the kind of “good trouble” former Congressman John Lewis spoke about. Wherever your path takes you, remember that you can help repair our damaged world anywhere you find yourself.

crimson_2022_88,"In the early days of my freshman fall, I left a friend stunned by a revelation of my 3 a.m. weekday shenanigans. Every other night, I walked down alone from Pennypacker Hall to the CVS at the corner of Mass. Ave and JFK Street — untethered to a can of pepper spray. He proceeded to ask me if I really felt that safe as a woman in Cambridge — safe enough to warrant a claim to hours beyond midnight and the absence of self defense in my back pocket. I responded almost defensively. Since childhood, I’ve been accustomed to being catcalled on the street, feigning phone calls in an Uber, and waking up to a new case of curbside assault everyday — despite growing up in one of the safer cities of urban India. Cambridge, then, seemed a world away from the explicit harassment that so characterized my adolescence. After all, I was no longer photographed by men on the street, stared at in public spaces, or cornered in alleyways. The “I’m safer here than I am there” rationale is arguable, but I continue to subscribe to it. Late into freshman year, I no longer look back home to justify my 3 a.m. pursuits. I only need to look next door — at the statistics of on-campus assault at Harvard. Instances of assault here are far more unnerving than those back home, for the immediacy and familiarity of the perpetrators. I feel no safer in class than I do on Mass. Ave, so I deliberately lay claim to the hours and places I’m cautioned against. Just as unnerving is the administration’s response to assault. On paper, they demonstrate an awareness of these statistics and an effort to address them: the 2017splitof the Title IX Office, the implementation ofmandatory trainingfor faculty and students, the establishment ofanonymous disclosure, and an expansion of the coordinator body. But these demonstrations are untenable with what thenumbershave to say: very little has changed in the prevalence of on-campus assault and the infrequency of reporting. These two metrics are equally concerning because they are inextricably intertwined in affirming a permissive culture that translates to perceived immunity for perpetrators. Over the first few weeks of first year orientation, we were introduced to Title IX, safety trainings, and an alcohol awareness module. We ran over the ideas of consent and substance use, and were handed a list of emergency contacts. What I was really looking for in these modules, though, was more than knowing to space out my drinks or go to parties in groups. These measures may be essential, but they’re largely preventive. As women, we needed to make sure we never drank too much and always had a ride back home, because the threats of assault were treated as constants; they would simply continue to exist, and we’d have to work our way around them. In contrast, we were told nothing about the repercussions for perpetrators, tangible actions guaranteed by the College if we came forward as victims, or the detailed reporting process a victim could expect to work through. Training modules tell us everything about intervention and avoidance, and nothing about consequence or institutional accountability. This approach promulgates a dangerous culture. As students enter our institution, they are told that their responsibility on campus is to protect themselves and those around them. While this responsibility matters, centering the discussion around it at the cost of other conversations glosses over the many members of the Harvard community that have perpetrated assault themselves, implying that these individuals are immune to consequence. Coupled with the convolutions of reporting mechanisms, it comes as no surprise that some students lack confidence in the existing reporting procedures — and perhaps even fear it — while others assume immunity from consequence. In areporton sexual harassment at Harvard, an external review comittee found “widespread confusion about even the most fundamental aspects of the reporting system,” writing that, “Multiple individuals, for instance, did not know the difference between the Title IX Office and the ODR” — the Office for Dispute Resolution — “or the difference between a disclosure and a formal complaint.” At its most twisted, this culture transforms into the College’s string of high-profile professors who have sexually harassed and assaulted their students for years with little more than a slap on the wrist.Domínguez.Fryer.Makadon.Bestor.Urton.Comaroff. Harvard has shown it does not protect its women — especially when the reputations of powerful men are at stake. Unsurprisingly, the student body has little faith left in the integrity of the University s investigative procedures. As the average freshman, I know very little about my first point of contact when I feel unsafe, or what I should expect if I ever need to file a formal complaint. For an institution that aggressively solicits detailed course evaluations twice a semester, I shouldn’t need to defer to writing an op-ed to communicate that. If Harvard is truly committed to addressing its climate of sexual harassment, measures need to move beyond online education modules and prevention training. Assault must be addressed at the heart of the institution’s culture: a restructuring of administrative priorities, a guarantee of action and protection for survivors that come forward, and an emphasis on institutional and individual accountability. As the administration acknowledges its problematic past and identifies where it fails its students, it needs to place more weight on the experiences of individuals most impacted by it. It shouldn’t be easier to navigate the College’s sexual harassment policies as a perpetrator than as a survivor. I shouldn’t feel safer during my nightly unguarded CVS runs than I do on campus.

wildcat_arizona_2022_59,"Caitlin Claypool Photo Illustration: Student Alex Kramer stresses out over a homework assignment in Alpha Epsilon Phi chapter house. The pressure to push oneself can carry on throughout the summer. Kelly MarryJuly 2, 2022 After the semester ends and finals are finished, summer officially begins for college students. Many students get summer jobs and take summer classes, but the burnout from the semester may stop people from wanting to attend their jobs and courses. Finals have students studying for weeks, and the semester feels like it is never-ending with exams, essays and projects. Students need to realize that they do not have to be productive every day of the summer. Society has groomed us into always wanting to be doing something, because if you are not doing something productive, you are wasting your time. This is otherwise known astoxic productivity. Free time should be a way to recharge from how hard someone is working; it’s not about feeling bad when someone has idle hands. The need to always be hustling to the next task is harmful and should not be expected from people. The pandemic did not help with the need to be productive. With school going online, there is more free time and a need to fill that time with productive activities. This feeling of needing to always be productive is calledtime anxiety. Time anxiety is the need to fill every day with productive things and feeling like you are wasting your time. Even though restrictions are calming and everything is open, time anxiety is still prevalent, especially since it is the summer. RELATED:OPINION: My life looks nothing like my Instagram and neither does yours Summer can be an excellent opportunity for students to earn extra money, travel, take summer classes and hang out with friends and family. After five months of studying and classes, summer can be a welcome, slow change. Being less productive during the summer is a fantastic way for students to take care of themselves and prepare for the upcoming fall semester. Coming off of finals and the stress of the semester can make it hard to relax over the summer, but there areactivitiesthat can help with burnout. Some activities I have done during the summer are running, walking, journaling, sleeping, watching movies and reading. Studiesfrom the BMC psychology journal have shown that using mindfulness apps and listening to music have helped decrease stress. Students need to have breaks and activities they can count on to be a distraction from burnout. Researchfrom the Wellbeing Thesis — a collaboration project between the University of Derby,Student Mindsand King’s College London — has shown that taking breaks reduces stress and fatigue and can help reset your mood. Constant productivity sounds excellent in theory, but to reach one’s full potential, you must take breaks and walk away from your work. Needing to be continuously productive is a toxic mindset that many college students have. If we are not doing something productive every day, then it feels like we are falling behind, even though that is not the case. Being productive is essential for getting things done quickly and efficiently, but being productive all the time is destructive and can worsen one’s mental health. In the summer, many students have more free time, so they need more things to do to fill the time, but it is important to remember that it is okay to relax, unwind and be lazy after working hard all semester.

crimson_2022_67,"Dialectics (di-uh-lektiks . Noun. The first time I saw this word, nestled under week three of the syllabus for one of my courses last semester, I was confused — a state I ve frequently found myself in during my first year at Harvard College. According to Google, dialectics is defined as “the art of investigating or discussing the truth of opinions,” with a secondary definition being the “inquiry into metaphysical contradictions and their solutions.” Two vastly different entities that are inextricably linked in constant conflict, but ultimately coexist to form a single truth. The paradoxical nature of the term immediately captured my attention. For days, despite my best efforts, my mind inevitably wandered back to the concept of dialectics. It felt incredibly close to home. In many ways, my mere existence as Black woman at Harvard is a constant game of dialectics. As an ambitious high schooler, Harvard was a thing of fairy tales. Its elusive prestige filled my mind with visions of old white men in suits huddled around dark rooms and smoking cigars as they plotted the future of civilization. Meanwhile, I was sitting on the living room floor and bumping SZA as my sister carefully unraveled my braids. Harvard seemed unlike anything that could possibly exist in the same universe as mine. Then, in December of 2020, I was accepted — and my mind refused to comprehend it. For years, I’d placed this institution on an unattainable pedestal from which it looked down on almost everything else, myself included. I felt unworthy of my place, unsure of how I could possibly fit in with the Ivy League culture that was soon to surround me. Nevertheless, August came around and I labored through the grueling course registration process. Determined to embrace the spirit of exploration for my first year, I’d even decided as a die-hard humanities student to take a science course — an intriguing blend of primatology and linguistics. Every Monday and Wednesday at 3 p.m., I took a rickety vintage elevator up to the fifth floor of the Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology and had fun discussions about whether monkeys could talk. But one day, while mindlessly browsing through The Crimson’s website, I stumbled upon anarticlefrom earlier in the year about the discovery of possible remains of enslaved people on campus — and the story’s cover photo made my stomach drop. Staring unabashedly back at me from my laptop screen was the very same building I scanned into twice a week. The red brick no longer seemed rustically charming, but stained with the blood of my ancestors. Never again could I enjoy my novel vintage elevator rides without the eerie curiosity looming over me that somewhere along the way, I was passing the displaced remains of my ancestors — subjugated in life, and still not guaranteed peace and rest in death. Moments like these serve as a constant reminder of my standing as an alien to this planet of unequivocal whiteness. I am a descendant of slaves taking a class in the building of a historically white institution that houses the possible remains of 15 individuals of African descent who were likely alive during American slavery. My college experience will perpetually be shaped by these terrors of the past, as well as the need to grapple with my own complicity in the present. As a generationally African American woman, my familial history has always been a giant question mark. Centuries ago, my ancestors were ripped from their homelands and separated around the country during chattel slavery; today, I am forced to reckon with the gaping hole that this has left in my soul. Even so, I exist at a university that can readily access its own history — yet chooses not to prioritize its accurate retelling and reconciliation. Or the history of the people that suffered at its expense. Parallel narratives, trapped in neverending conflict on opposite ends of a single orbit. A dialectic masterpiece, and my current nightmarish reality. Each of these two narratives at Harvard — Black womanhood and white supremacy — must occur in tandem with one another. In order to capture the full truth of this University, we must grapple with the fact that both whiteness and patriarchy are violently and inextricably linked with its history. Harvard must realize that the knowledge of one s history is a sacred, often underappreciated privilege that must be wielded with appropriate reverence. Therefore, to be a Black woman at Harvard is to exist as a walking paradox: A living, breathing revolution. The dialectics of my existence — and that of every other Black woman at this institution — means forming a vibrant community of love and resilience amidst the generations of hatred stacked against us, and boldly demanding the uplifting of our truth within a veritas that was never intended to include us in the first place.

rice_thresher_2022_63,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/1/22 10:43pm It has finally happened. After 18 months ofprotests, Facebook arguments and countlessfeedbackforms, the Rice University Board of Trusteesannouncedlast Tuesday that the statue of William Marsh Rice would be relocated to a less central location within the Academic Quadrangle. The decision, viewed as a compromise by nearly everyone, understandably received mixed reviews, including from Rice community members who have long since graduated: President David Leebronsaidthat while some alumni responses were “very angry,” others called the decision “thoughtful.” Those “very angry” responses are surprising to no one, as many alumni have made their position on the statue’s removal very clear since the idea wasproposedby students in mid-2020. But now that the move is official, we feel it is time to address these criticisms. To those that are outraged by this decision, we have two simple questions. Does your love of Rice University really boil down to the placement of a statue? And if so, how deep could that love have been in the first place? It is hard to succinctly cover the array of opinions expressed over the statue’s removal, but the overall theme boils down to the following. One alumniwrotethat the statue’s move will “end all my support to Rice,” while another added that “this will only stop when people stop donating.” In truth, there is nothing hypocritical about deciding that the relocation of the Founder’s Memorial is a bridge too far and choosing to withdraw one’s emotional support from Rice. Perhaps you loved this school while you were a student, but you disagree with this decision and no longer feel that affection. Yet implicit in the act of donating to your alma mater is the notion that you feel a strong enough connection to the university that you want to see it prosper even after you’ve walked out of the Sallyport. Indeed, that feeling is so strong that you have placed a monetary value on it. The decision to relocate and contextualize the statue was made in an effort to better the university for current and future students; the Board wouldn’t have made it for any other reason. To withdraw your financial support from an institution that chooses to prioritize those concerns says more about you than it does about the institution. It says that you value your resistance to change over the well-being of Rice and its student body. To the person thatsaid“The spirit of Rice University sure has changed! Let’s focus more on higher learning,” we couldn’t agree more. This decision was made for the same reason almost every decision is made on this campus: to help students feel more at home at Rice and to facilitate a stronger learning environment. To the alumni upset by this announcement, it is time you take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself if you truly care about the future of this university.

thetech_mit_2022_42,"The war in Ukraine is heart-breaking. Combining the words “war” and “nuclear” adds fear and raises a host of questions amid uncertainty and sadness. Ukraine is a country that derives over half of its electricity from nuclear energy and has 15 reactors generating electricity. Ukraine is also the location of the decommissioned Chernobyl power plant, which was the site of the worst nuclear accident in history. Here is a video about what happened at Chernobyl, by Professor Mike Short, as taught in 22.01 (Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Ionizing Radiation , Fall 2016:https: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijst4g5KFN0. The mission of the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE includes educating students and informing public discussion of nuclear science and technology. As members of MIT’s faculty, we are committed to both the Institute and NSE s shared mission to provide unbiased, technical information. This mission motivates our open letter, with some answers to the most commonly asked questions we have received. Is the spent fuel in storage at the Chernobyl site a danger due to loss of power? The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA has noted that while a loss of power at the Chernobyl site is a concern, it does not mean that the spent fuel storage facility becomes immediately more dangerous. The loss of power was considered in aseries of post-Fukushima analysesof the Chernobyl spent fuel storage facility , and it was found that loss of cooling systems would not lead to an urgent risk of significant radioactivity release. This is because the temperature of the spent fuel can be managed by ensuring that adequate water remains in the pool. We estimate that enough water to cool down the spent fuel can be maintained manually for a duration of seven to eight months with water supplies on-site. The physical reason behind this conclusion is that the release of some radioactive gases to the environment will occur only if the temperature of the spent fuel is high enough to cause the fuel cladding to rupture. The temperatures at which the leakage of gases occurs varies based on details of the cladding, but a typical range would be 300 to 650 degrees Celsius. Since water boils at 100 degrees Celsius, as long as there is water in the pool, the spent fuel temperatures stay below temperatures where radioactive gas leakage occurs. If loss of power occurred, the water would have to be replaced faster than it evaporates away. How quickly the water evaporates depends on the heating power of the spent fuel, which in turn depends on many factors, but primarily the burn up of the fuel and the time since the fuel was used in a reactor. Using published values for the spent fuel in the storage pool, we estimate around 1 megawatt of heat in the spent fuel. At this power, water would boil away at a rate of about 8 gallons per minute. That is the flow rate of a garden hose, making replacement of the water by hand possible. The site has about 10,000 cubic meters (or 2.6 million gallons of makeup water available, good for seven to eight months of water replacement. Are nuclear power plants (NPPs more vulnerable or less vulnerable than other kinds of power plants to a military or terrorist attack? Overall, NPPs are less vulnerable but an attack could have high consequences. NPPs are among the most robust civilian infrastructures on the planet, with multiple layers of protection. NPPs must, by law, be able to withstand terrorist attacks as well as a broad range of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, wildfires, and floods. Ukraine’s NPPs have multiple layers of protection. In the event of an attack, the nuclear reactors can be rapidly shut down. There are also emergency diesel generators and batteries that would ensure the reliable operation of critical equipment, such as pumps, valves, and instruments, as well as continued adequate cooling for the reactor cores if power were lost. These diesel generators and batteries sit behind thick reinforced concrete walls that cannot be penetrated by light weapons. However, it should be made clear that no backup is completely infallible. Even the most robust backups can be disrupted by direct actions of an invading force. The results of such actions could then lead to a release of radioactivity from the nuclear plants, as we explain next. What happens if power is lost to an operating NPP, like Zaporizhzhia? Should we be worried about a meltdown and release of radiation similar to what happened at Fukushima? A similar sequence of events would be very unlikely. This is because after the 2011 accident at the Fukushima Daiichi site in Japan, Ukraine’s NPPs were retrofitted with additional layers of protection. For example, if the emergency diesel generators and batteries were to fail simultaneously, there are now mobile backup diesel generators and pumps that can keep the reactor cores cool. In other words, there are backups for the backup. An attack that damaged the emergency diesel generators and batteries as well as the backup equipment might reduce cooling of the reactor core and lead to damage to the nuclear fuel, up to fuel melting. In this scenario, the plant would be unlikely to operate ever again; however, the vast majority of the radioactivity would be retained within the containment structure of the plant. Some radioactivity might leak from the containment structure and disperse locally, but health effects would be almost certainly undetectable even near the structure. Among people further away, exposure would be below that routinely encountered in diagnostic medical procedures by millions of people worldwide. NPPs are designed to adhere to national and international safety standards in order to be licensed for operation. This means that all NPPs worldwide are subject to very similar standards and are continuously monitored and reviewed by national regulators and international organizations such as the World Association of Nuclear Operators and the IAEA. Each NPP is peer-reviewed every couple of years, lessons are learned from mishaps, and operating experience is shared widely. The system has further improved after Fukushima. But no system will be perfect, which is why risks are always being assessed and a process of continuous improvement is in place. All industries that involve complex engineered systems and involve risk of hazards (oil, gas, and chemical sectors; hydropower, rail, aviation, and maritime transport; and, of course, nuclear power use data from accidents and near-accidents to inform the continuous improvement of safety systems. The goal is to avoid a similar accident or near-accident ever happening again. Where can I find real-time, fact-based updates about the nuclear situation in Ukraine? An American Nuclear Society (ANS Rapid Response Taskforce exists to provide information about nuclear safety and security around the world. For the past several weeks, the Taskforce has been focused on Ukraine. The NSE encourages everyone who has concerns or questions about the nuclear situation in Ukraine to reference the ANS Rapid Response Taskforce website and sign up for updates athttps: www.ans.org/response. Additional expert resources are linked from the Taskforce webpage.

crimson_2022_162,"“To understand the world, you must first understand a place like Mississippi.” - William Faulkner My hometown of Jackson, Mississippi has been on water boil notice for two months. This isn’t the first time that Jackson residents have had a lack of access to safe, clean water — it happens fairly often in a city that has been subject to negligence and neglect for decades on end. Jackson is one of the Blackest cities in one of the Blackest states in America, and is in the company of many Black cities across the country that have been subject to limited access to health care, limited educational resources, impoverishment, and premature death. Jackson sits in the heart of Mississippi, surrounded by wealthy predominantly-white cities and counties that seem to avoid the infrastructural problems that Jackson faces so often. And, as the capital of Mississippi, Jackson is filled with lawmakers who often fail to care about the poor quality of life that the predominately-Black residents of Jackson experience. The water problem in Jackson began, not in August when central Mississippi was hit with historic rainfall, but earlier. In April of this year, prior to the peak of Jackson’s water and infrastructure problem, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba and other politicians asked the state legislature for additional funding for their water problems. However, the Mississippi State Legislature refused to allocate Jackson enough money to adequately fund and solve their infrastructure problems. Thus when the rainfall and flooding started, this led to Jackson’s already-struggling water system to fail. Though it worsened this summer, Jackson’s water crisis has been brewing for years now. In 2016, a state report found lead in Jackson’s water system. And, in 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency found that Jackson’s drinking water “had the potential to host harmful bacteria or parasites.” Then, in 2021, a severe winter storm caused residents to be without water for a month. The water problem in Jackson isn’t a partisan issue that can be chalked up to whether leadership in the city is red or blue. The problem in Jackson, Miss., is one of racial capitalism and anti-Blackness. Black populations have continuously been at the forefront of government neglect and violence. Whether it be Flint, Mich., Mount Vernon, N.Y., or Jackson, Miss., the problem is systemic and reflective of a larger history of anti-Blackness in America. Water is politics. Access to water affects every aspect of life. Besides being unable to shower and drink water, people in Jackson don t even have enough water to fight fires and flush toilets. Jackson is facing this issue, not due to municipal mismanagement, but because after years of white flight and segregation, Jackson became a majority Black city left behind to suffer in favor of wealthier white cities. A product of the legacies of slavery, Jim Crow, and the War on Drugs, Jackson has had to fight against the rugged terrain of anti-Black governance for years now, and this has culminated in the crisis we see today. Capitalism and anti-Blackness are the structuring modalities of a society birthed off the backs of slavery, and it is only when the legacies of anti-Blackness are addressed that Black populations are no longer treated as disposable. Treating the water crisis in Jackson as an isolated event just puts a bandaid on a bullet wound. The structural problems that Jackson faces today were years in the making–a legacy of anti-Blackness that spans the history of Mississippi and this nation. Before Jackson, there was Flint. Before Flint, there was Lowndes County Alabama, and there will only be more cities to add to the list as the years go on. A first step to helping Jackson would be donating toCooperation Jackson,The Mississippi Food Network, orThe Mississippi Rapid Response Coalition. But on a larger, more structural level, it is our jobs as students now and as leaders in the future to fight for change in the status quo. In the years to come, we will be the next generation of writers, politicians, CEOs, and business owners. We will soon have the power to make decisions that will impact our future for the better or worse, and it is only through a concerted effort that we can fight the structures of oppression within our society and strive to create a better world for all those that live in it.

state_press_2022_17,"With the proposal s approval, ASU could potentially lose out-of-state and international students to other universities. ASU students will see a rise in tuition next year if the Arizona Board of Regents approves President Michael Crow s tuition increase. This decision could potentially affect out-of-state and international students the most as there will be a4% increase for non-residents of Arizona and a 5% for internationalstudents. Students will be forced to deprioritize academics to focus on financial concerns. READ MORE:ASU President Michael Crow proposes tuition increases for 2022-23 academic year With the proposal s approval, ASU could potentially lose out-of-state and international students to other universities. According to Business Insider, international students contribute$30 billionto the U.S. economy. But international students are now more reluctant than ever to attend university in the U.S. due to discrimination, immigration rules and health concerns. According to thePew ResearchCenter, Fewer than 1 million foreign students enrolled for either online or in-person classes at U.S. universities in the 2020-21 school year, comprising 4.6% of total enrollment at American higher educational institutions. After a year of international students hesitation to study in the U.S. because of COVID-19 and immigration controversies, with tuition potentially increasing, students are going to feel even less welcome at our University with limited financial aid options. While international students bring in lots of revenue to the U.S. system of higher education, they are not necessarily prioritized as far as scholarships and financial aids go, said Valeriia Starosek, an international student and senior computer science student. The University boasts it is theNo. 1public university chosen by international students, but with the proposed increase, ASU should expect that ranking to fall. International students have almost no control over their financial situation due to the immigration law stipulations. They are limited in their options for making money, and the sources of income that are most easily available to them (working part-time on campus can in no way match the financial obligations, Starosek said. As an international student, I m more focused on academics and keeping up with my grade point average than on my financial obligations. But unfortunately, with this proposed tuition increase, I will be forced to rethink that decision and get a job to keep afloat. As an international student, it s hard when you don t know if you will be able to pay for your education. Some of us aren t financially independent and depend on scholarships and family to help us. The story isn t any better for out-of-state students as they struggle to reach these financial demands. I am an out-of-state student. My tuition is over $15,000 a semester and I am not qualified for FAFSA. For ASU to be a public university, they are charging too much for tuition, said Taylor Salvato, a film and media production student. Students are also confused by ASU increasing tuition costs when they don t see any improvements made to their education. They ask for all this money for tuition because they want to make the school better but focus it on the same things, Salvato said. As an international student, additional stress and worry would overtake my life as I find ways to favor my educational expenses. It wouldn t be enough to only be a student and I would also be forced to focus on ways to afford my education. Students should never have to find themselves in a situation where the financial issue becomes an obstacle on their way to success, Starosek said. International students help the University grow by bringingwork ethicand dedication to their academics. This not only helps the University by contributing to the performance of the academic institution, but also allows the U.S. economy to thrive. The best thing ASU should be doing now if the plan to continue with this proposed tuition increase is to offer more scholarships, especially scholarships for the international community and transfer students.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_29,"Co-host of ABC’s “The View,” Whoopi Goldberg has recently come under fire for her disparaging remarks regarding the Holocaust. On the January 31stepisodeof the popular talkshow, Goldberg claimed that the Holocaust was “not about race” and instead about “man’s inhumanity to man” while the co-hosts were discussing Tenessee’s decision to ban Art Spiegelman’s “Maus” in schools. Although her co-hosts challenged her assertion by arguing that the Holocaust was rooted in white supremacy, she doubled down on her remarks: “these are two white groups of people” said Goldberg in regards to the mass genocide of millions of Jewish people. After her disparaging remarks, Goldberg appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert toexplainher perspective on the matter and maintained her belief that race is about the color of your skin. “Being Black when we talk about race, it’s a different thing for me. Because as a Black person, I think of race as something that I can see.” Goldberg said on theshow. Goldberg later apologized for her remarks with a statement posted on Twitter, correcting her previous comments and emphasizing the Nazi’s outlook towards Jewish people as an inferior race. “The Jewish people around the world have always had my support and that will never waiver. I’m sorry for the hurt I caused,” Goldbergtweeted. pic.twitter.com/KUpdyhQnho Despite her apology, ABC News presidentKim Godwinrightfully announced that Goldberg would be suspended from the show due to “her wrong and hurtful comments.” Goldberg’s blunder on the talkshow seems to stem from her misinterpretation of the word “race” in context with the Holocaust — a completely irresponsible move on her part. Goldberg should have curated her thoughts more critically and responsibly before she stated her opinion. While it was reckless of Goldberg to falsely misinterpret that the Holocaust was not about race, one can understand why her views on race, and ultimately racism would be largely based on skin color because the prejudice Black Americans have faced for centuries. As a Black woman in the United States, the history of the struggle of Goldberg’s people is well documented. From theAtlantic Slave Tradethat brought millions of Africans as slaves to the Americas,Jim Crowlaws that made Black Americans second-class citizens, and the constantfatal police shootingsof unarmed Black people, it’s resonable to think that Goldberg likely did not mean any harm when claiming that the Holocaust was not an issue of white supremacy but one of race — as Black Americans have dealt and continue to deal with racism and prejudice, since the inception of this country. Even though Black Americans have dealt with race related issues for centuries, the context of race in the Holocaust has equivalent connations. The implication of thisfalse conceptof the Aryan race was adapted, manipulated, and radicalized from Nazi officials. Prior to manipulation and radicalization of the term, “Aryan” was used to define the similarities between European languages such as Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi, Sanskrit, and other related languages. However, the Nazi party adapted the word and defined it as a term to racially group people who they thought were inferior. Consequently, Nazi officials used the term inlegislationsin order to exclude Jewish people and other non-Aryans from professions, organizations, and other aspects of life. The ideas of Adolf Hitler and theNaziregime deeming Jewish people as being a weak, dangerous and an “inferior race,” is a classifcation of racism and race in itself. Not only did the Nazi Party claim the Jewish commuity as an inferior group of people, they alsolabeledother groups — Gypsies, Polish, Russian, and physically and mentally disabled people — as not deserving to be alive. The view towards race, anti-semitism and the belief thatNazisbelonged to a “master race” of people, is what caused the massgenocideof the millions of people who were forced into Nazi concentraction camps during World War II. Despite the fact that they share the same skin complexion, the Nazisindicatedthat those of German or related blood were eligible to be citizens but not Jewish, Black, and Romani — also called “Gypsies” — people. In short, the Nazi ideology was based on the superiority of their white, Aryan race who were from German or other related ethnic backgrounds that they consdered somewhat equal to them. Goldberg’s misinterpretive comment about the Holocaust is well deserving of an apology. She should have carefully thought through her comments before misconstruing the concept of race in the Holocaust. Without knowing the full context and facts behind her remarks, it came off as reckless and ignorant due to her not fully comprehending the Nazi’s racial ideologies. It cannot be ignored that the events of the Holocaust were rooted in white supremacy, as it dealt with the systematic murder and extermination of all races which the Nazi Party found inferior. Goldberg’s irresponsible choice of words should be condemned. Eric Mena is an Opinion Intern for the 2022 winter quarter. He can be reached atermena@uci.edu."
thetech_mit_2022_5,"On February 16,MIT Divestfiled a legal complaint with the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General to investigate the MIT Corporation’s continued financial investment in the fossil fuel sector. Frustrated with universities’ insufficient action in the face of the climate crisis,our student divestment campaign and similar groupsfrom Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and Vanderbilt each prepared a legal complaint with the assistance of attorneys from theClimate Defense Project. Signatures from prominent professors, community members, climate scientists, elected officials, student organizations, alumni, and national environmental organizations supporting the cause show that there is widespread agreement that investments in fossil fuels are not just immoral and financially irresponsible — they are also illegal. The complaint is a request to Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to investigate the MIT Corporation’s conduct regarding its management of MIT’s$27.4 billionendowment and use the Attorney General’s enforcement powers to order the Corporation to cease its investments in fossil fuels. Under the MassachusettsUniform Prudential Management of Institutional Funds Act, the MIT Corporation has a fiduciary duty to invest with consideration for the university’s “charitable purposes” — a duty that distinguishes nonprofit institutions from other investors. By investing a portion of MIT’s endowment in the fossil fuel industry, the Corporation is violating that duty and failing to “act in good faith and with loyalty.” Putting our university’s endowment into an industry actively contributing to the rapidly evolving climate catastrophe, while continuing to lie and spread misinformation about the role of fossil fuels in creating this crisis, isnotinvesting with prudence as the law requires. MIT Divest’s complaint is another reminder that MIT does not function within a vacuum. The MIT administration has shied away from taking clear stances against fossil fuel companies due to the“risk” of “becoming perceived as just another partisan voice.”But this so-called “risk” is no risk — it is the unfortunaterealityfor anyone who acknowledges the scientific consensus and stands for the truth about climate change. Fossil fuel companies areintensely politicalandpartisanin their promotion of their own agendas and obstruction of climate action — just ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, and the American Petroleum Institute alonespent over $400 million from 2011 to 2021 lobbying the U.S. government. Furthermore, the industry has conducted climate misinformation campaigns for nearly half a century, despite possessing evidence linking fossil fuel burning to climate changedecades before the general public. By remaining invested in fossil fuel stocks on the false grounds of political neutrality, MIT not only willfully blinds itself to the political ramifications of its investments but also funds the efforts of the fossil fuel industry to twist truth and science into political theater. Refusal to divest is also a deliberate, direct stance upholding the status quo — and the climate status quo is grossly unjust. Climate change exacerbates inequity at every scale. Affordable housing units within low-lying regions here in Massachusetts areespecially vulnerableto flooding from rising sea levels and intensified weather events. Within the U.S., if fossil fuel usage continues to rise, the counties in the bottom five percent of incomeare projected to sufferclimate-associated economic damages of 5.5% to 27.6% of total county income while those in the top five percent are expected to face much smaller income losses of up to 4.2% or even small gains of up to 1.1%. Globally, climate change hasalready created an additional 25% GDP disparitybetween the wealthiest and poorest countries and ispredicted to continue worseningglobal economic inequity. Precedent for taking clear, unequivocal stances against injustice — even when those stances can be construed as political — can be found in MIT’s own history. In 2007, MIT declared that it“will not invest in a company whose actions or expressed attitudes are abhorrent to MIT”in response to calls from student activists to divest its endowment from funds linked to acts of genocide against the Darfuri people in western Sudan. More recently, the MIT administration has consistently demonstrated its support for Professor Gang Chen, an MIT faculty member targeted by the U.S. Department of Justice under the China Initiative, a project widely criticized by civil rights activists asdiscriminatory against individuals of Chinese heritage. We at MIT Divest applaud the MIT administration for standing against immoral and unjust actions in both of these instances. We demand that MIT once again recognizes the political ramifications of all of the institution’s actions. We demand that MIT consciously chooses to uphold the principles of truth and justice. And we demand that MIT takes actionnow. As theeffects of climate changecontinue to debilitate our planet and its people, the need to act becomes more dire by the second. We may not be able to reverse the damage that has been done, butwecanprevent further catastrophe for ourselves and our descendants. It will take drastic changes, however, and include technological advances to be developed here at MIT. Yet, even as our institutionstrives to foster this innovation, our leadership continues to contribute to the problem by maintaining their investments in fossil fuels. Until the industry loses the support of respected institutions, they will continue decimating our climate for profit. We know that MIT has the power to put its money where its mouth is and remove our investments from fossil fuels. In doing so, we will join a growing coalition of organizations who are not afraid to challenge the status quo and save our planet. Furthermore, due to MIT’s status as a leading academic institution, divesting at MIT will catalyze further climate action around the world. This series of legal complaints illustrates the growing legal opposition to fossil fuel investment. Themajority of students and facultyon our campus, as well asmany prominent figuresin our area, support divestment. If it takes legal action for MIT to listen to its community, uphold the truth, and stand against global injustice, what does that say about what this institution really stands for? In order for MIT to truly live up to its mission statement and continue to be a leader in changing the world for the better, there is only one option:divestment now.

crimson_2022_71,"In September of 2021, 96 percent of undergraduatesvotedto keep shopping week. How then could a faculty committeerecommendonly three months later to scrap it in favor of a system of early registration? Given the committee members’ background, I suspect the recommendation was preordained. As trial lawyers might tell you, if they can choose the jury, they can guarantee the verdict. Now, I myself have taught at Harvard College and recognize the validity of some of the committee’s concerns. With the in-semester enrollment that shopping week entails, instructors don’t know whether they’ll end up teaching a large lecture class or a small seminar. They don’t know in advance how many teaching fellows they’ll need and whether the classroom assigned needs to be changed. Moreover, if the first sessions of the course are not appealing, undergrads will not take it — and a sparsely populated classroom can damage any instructor’s self-esteem. Many grad students, as teaching fellows for courses, especially resent shopping week. The committee report quotes one as saying, “The course I was originally assigned to teach was half the size they guessed, so I had to scramble to find another course. As a consequence, I was incredibly stressed for 2 weeks and got almost nothing done.” Do two weeks of stress for a grad student weigh more heavily than a possibly life-changing course for a single undergraduate, let alone dozens? I have no doubt shopping week encourages undergrads to explore academic disciplines and broaden intellectual horizons. In addition to having been an instructor at the College, I was also an undergraduate here. A friend of mine from back in the 1970s and 1980s remembers sitting in on a graduate economics course during shopping week. What do you know? He found the material fascinating and realized he could handle it. Without shopping week, he wonders whether he would have followed an academic path that led to a Ph.D. in Economics and over 40 years as a professor with more than 50 publications. Still, even back in our day, faculty members were trying toeliminate shopping week. This time, though, they seem to really mean it. It’s not because undergraduates no longer want to explore, though. In December, an undergrad Music concentrator told me how she’d shopped Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science,” saying she’d never have had the guts to try it out without test-driving it first. Now she’s a Teaching Fellow for an advanced CS course. A current student at the Law School told me checking out classes during shopping week “changed my life.” She went on to say, “I s it not…the professor’s job to TEACH students? Being asked to do your job isn’t a reason to eliminate shopping week.” Without shopping week, students will inevitably opt for safe choices and high Q scores in their course selections. I’ll wager pre-registration will mean more Government, Economics, Computer Science, and Neuroscience concentrators. I’ve been a sophomore adviser for the past four years and dread what this will mean to small departments like Folklore and Mythology; Anthropology; Art, Film, and Visual Studies; Music; Sociology; and other disciplines which are often stumbled upon rather than sought out. So how did the committee come to recommend abolishing shopping week? The original 2019/20 appointees to the committee included six Faculty of Arts and Sciences professors. Not one of them had attended the College and gained the life-changing benefits of shopping week. Presumably all had experienced its aggravations, though. The six registrars, deans, and other administrators on the 2019/20 committee may have dealt with the hassles of shopping week, but they did not have a countervailing experience with it as an undergrad. Additionally, there were two Harvard graduate students on the 2019/20 committee. Over the next couple years, the number of instructors on the committee would dwindle, while half a dozen more administrators — only two of whom had attended the College — joined. Since only three of the original seventeen committee members experienced shopping week as Harvard undergraduates (the two College students and a Business School professor , one would think the committee would have reached out to a broad swathe of alumni who have the perspective to judge the value of shopping week. But there’s no sign of anything like that in the report. Instead, members contacted “registrars at peer institutions, which have universally adopted systems of Previous-Term Registration.” Since when is homogenization — being like other schools — a reason to change? The College prides itself on its distinctiveness— a Harvard-ness embodied by shopping week. A classmate of mine who interviews applicants to the College uses shopping week to differentiate Harvard from Stanford. In a2018 survey, 62 percent of undergrads indicated that the existence of shopping influenced their decision to come to Harvard. The College should be doing what it can to empower students’ intellectual exploration, not limiting it because of administrative burden. Fortunately, the committee’s report is only a recommendation to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Let’s hope the Faculty votes in favor of maintaining shopping week, to foster the exposure of students — as the College’s mission statement puts it — “to new ideas, new ways of understanding, and new ways of knowing.” Keith Raffel ’72 was a lecturer at Harvard College from 2019 to 2021 and is currently a Resident Scholar at Mather House."
state_press_2022_3,"An Ohio district court ruled that Honorlock violated a student s constitutional right to privacy. Last month, an Ohio district court ruled that a room scan prior to an online test, like the ones required in some exams at ASU, violated a student’s constitutional right to privacy. While ASU s use of online proctoring services isn t directly implicated by the Ohio decision, ASU has a decision to make about continuing to use them. ASU has a three-to-five year commitment with Honorlock, which was named in the Ohioruling, as a proctoring solution for iCourse and oCourse classes. But it’s important the University doesn’t continue a precedent that eats away at our personal liberty. If ASU takes pride in itscharter, it should remember that it expresses a fundamental commitment to the “economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves.” Threats to privacy directly counter the social health of the ASU community. When asked for comment about the ruling, Tess Mitchell, Honorlock’s chief marketing officer, provided a link to the company sFAQ page, which defends the correct use of room scans as a best practice. It also correctly cautions that the Ohio district court decision is limited to a specific set of facts, is not a national ruling, and may be appealed. Kahlea Cranford, manager for Learning Experience Support with the University Technology Office, said in an email that they understand there is uncertainty regarding the ASU policy for online proctoring. An ASU spokesperson confirmed that the policy is currently being reviewed. Nothing can be said about Honorlock that isn’t already addressed in the nearly 2,500 Google reviews — which average aone-star rating— or the onlinepetitionfor ASU students, who have signed to Stop ASU from forcing Honorlock on students, which had 139 signatures at time of publication. Signers note that the monitoring is an invasion of privacy, an abuse of power and that students paying tuition should not be subjected to network snoopers. Similar petitions on campuses across the country echo those concerns and have raised others. Online proctoring services require complete privacy, creating issues for students living at home or with roommates, and invalidate a test if there’s movement in the background. They can pause while the clock continues to run if the tester is too fidgety, if their head is not positioned properly, or if there is background noise. The name Honorlock is as patronizing as the presumption of guilt that led to this tormenting practice. Honor implies trust. There’s no honor in being physically locked out of an opportunity to make a choice — the honor comes from making the right choice. It seems the academic integrity pledge that students often sign at the beginning of courses wasn’t enough. ASU claims Honorlock “stops cheating as it is happening.” That might be true, unless a student knows how to Google “how to cheat honorlock. There are articles. There are videos. There are Reddit threads. Providing these aren t meant to condone cheating, or to endorse these methods, but they do show that innovative students can find ways to deceive the invasive gaze of online proctors. What’s honorable about a service that’s cheatable, intrusive and adds stress to a community of students already struggling withanxiety? The truth is it’s the academic integrity of the University being shielded from shifty students who can’t be trusted. For Honorlock, that shield, ASU could be charged nearly $4.5 million for five years of use. READ MORE:From detecting phones to using decoy sites, Honorlock raises online test surveillance concerns There’s much more at stake than student mental health or academic integrity, though. As we grow increasingly comfortable with technology, we’re blurring the lines between public and private spaces in ways the government could exploit. Ben McJunkin, an associate law professor and associate deputy director of the Academy for Justice at ASU said the Supreme Court has already decided a number of cases with a troubling trend: The more we grant public access to spaces like our bedrooms, the less we can claim that they’re private. “If technology continues to change in a way that we have consistently invited an undiscriminating public into our private spaces, we’re gonna have less constitutional protection against the government, McJunkin said. In other words, if you BeReal in your bedroom, the government may think that implies you are fine with them coming in as well. McJunkin calls this reasoning “horrifically misguided,” but warns there is justifiable concern over the potential consequences. “I am delighted but shocked at the things my students are willing to share with me about their personal lives,” said Jessica Berch, a lecturer at the Sandra Day O Connor College of Law. “And remember, the definition of search is: ‘is this something you subjectively tried to keep private?’ And is it objectively reasonable? If you’re vomiting out all of this information, that puts a lot of pressure on that.” Intruders can argue that accessing someone’s bedroom isn’t a search if the student doesn’t keep it private. The defense representing Cleveland State made a version of this argument in the Ohioruling— which Honorlock reminds us might still be appealed. ASU shouldn’t wait to find out. With information accessible everywhere, Catherine O Donnell, a professor of history in the School of Historical, Philosophical and Religious Studies, believes professors should work with the University to design assessments that show students understand how to use information, support arguments and think creatively. While O Donnell is sensitive to the challenges that professors face, like designing exams for courses with a large number of students and ensuring knowledge has been gained, she agrees with what she has heard from students: that Honorlock is oppressive and ineffective. “Can ASU put more of its energy and more of its resources to helping faculty create gradable assessments at scale, to helping faculty figure out how to educate for mastery rather than focus on sorting and grading and gatekeeping?” O’Donnell said. I am glad to see HonorLock challenged, and by students. Doesn t it engage in a startling level of surveillance, in order to produce information that does not prove misconduct? Why are universities feeding this use of technology?https: t.co/zPvFBLrlfm ASU has three main choices: it can do nothing, it can change the policies, or it can end the practice altogether. Berch said if it changes the policies based on the ruling, they may actually choose to increase the use of room scans to avoid the appearance that scans are being used arbitrarily. Searches can be reasonable without a warrant if they’re applied to everyone, like airport security. When flying, we’re effectively offered a binary choice — fly and be searched or don’t fly. Choosing to allow ourselves to be searched is a tradeoff for flying on an airplane. ASU must do the honorable thing: recognize its fundamental responsibility to our community, and that not giving students a choice in sharing what they could otherwise keep private is eroding the rights of students. It must revise its policies to allow students to opt out of room scans, if not stop the practice altogether. If not, they may be complicit in locking us into a future where we have no choice at all.

thetech_mit_2022_54,"To the editor, I read last week’s opinion piece “We are unionizing for quality and affordable housing” with great interest because our department shares the goal of providing quality and affordable housing for members of the graduate student community and because we have been working with many campus partners in recent years toward that goal. Housing & Residential Services oversees on-campus housing assignments, as well as the repair, maintenance and stewardship of 19 residential houses. This includes eight graduate residences totaling 2,700 beds that can currently house up to 37% of MIT s graduate students. Our team is responsible for ensuring that residences are welcoming, safe, and support MIT’s distinctive residential experience. The opinion piece inaccurately characterized the Institute’s residential system as being out of touch with graduate students’ housing needs and offered an unfairly grim picture of the living conditions within our on-campus residence halls. It also claimed that a union will secure housing gains and a housing-related grievance process for graduate students in a collective bargaining agreement which, when you examine the collective bargaining agreements at Harvard and Columbia, has not occurred at these peer schools with graduate student unions. I’d like to share my perspective about our longstanding efforts to improve the MIT graduate housing experience, including resident satisfaction with the on-campus housing experience, MIT’s commitment to offering capacity to house nearly 50% of graduate students, and the ongoing collaboration that continues to create positive outcomes for the student experience. MIT shares our students’ goal of providing quality, affordable housing. We know that housing costs make up the largest portion of graduate students’ budgets, whether they live on or off campus. MIT’s housing inventory remains below the area market rates and our approach to rate-setting is informed by theGraduate Housing Working Group, which is composed of student leaders, Heads of House, and Institute leaders. The Institute sets rates on an annual basis based on a variety of factors, including housing operational costs, and shares projections with graduate student leaders who then incorporate the proposed housing rates into their annual stipend recommendation calculations. Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, MIT did not increase housing rates in 2021–22, even as the Instituteincreased graduate student stipends by 6.25%. MIT also provides students witha variety of additional financial resourcessuch as short- and long-term funding, and grants for graduate students with families. Our goal is to provide a range of housing options — single rooms, efficiencies, one-bedroom, and multi-bedroom units in a mix of newer and older buildings — so students can make choices that best fit their circumstances. As is the case with any housing system, rate increases are necessary to cover annual increases in operational costs — including livable wages for the hundreds of staff members who help keep our 24/7 housing operation running. As in any other housing system, buildings require regular maintenance and repairs. While the experiences described last week inThe Techdo not paint an accurate picture of most residents’ on-campus housing experience, I am always concerned whenever a resident has a negative experience and make sure we follow through on addressing those issues that do arise. We have a talented and committed team that is available to residents 24/7 to respond to building-related issues in partnership with the Department of Facilities. Longer-term, theMIT 2030 Frameworkwill help us to address deferred maintenance across the campus and in the residence halls. Our data show that graduate residents are overwhelmingly satisfied with their on-campus housing experience, and we are building more graduate residence halls. According to survey data,90% of respondentsagree or strongly agree that they are satisfied with their choice to live on campus. That’s why MIT graduate students continue to choose to live on campus — and in response to that demand, MIT’s residential system is in the midst of a significant expansion. By the fall of 2024, MIT will have delivered more than 1,075 new beds for graduate housing — surpassing a 950-bed commitment the Institute made in 2017 — which will provide capacity to house close to 50% of the graduate student population. Existing collaboration with student leaders creates positive outcomes. The partnership between the Institute, student government organizations and the Graduate Housing Working Group has led to tangible improvements in the overall graduate housing experience. We have partnered to create renewable housing contract opportunities to enable students to extend their on-campus housing assignments, expanded the housing options available to couples and streamlined housing processes, including adapting the contract period to better align with when students arrive for the start of their programs. With input from graduate student leaders, Heads of House and campus partners, we are upgrading our housing management system to improve our processes and offer a more user-friendly student experience. As part of this significant change, students will no longer need to go through a lottery process and will instead be able to select their desired housing unit. Through this new process, which will be launched this spring for the 2022–23 housing cycle, students will be able to view available housing options, compare different unit types and price points and select an on-campus housing option that meets their individual or family needs. MIT is home to some of the most innovative thinkers on earth, and I am proud that many of our graduate students call our residence halls home. We will continue to work with partners across the Institute to make improvements to our operations, systems, and the conditions of our current buildings, while we also expand housing capacity to provide even more on-campus housing opportunities for graduate students.

wildcat_arizona_2022_1,"“Gun Show”byM&R Glasgowis licensed underCC BY 2.0 The Arizona Senate Judiciary Committee approved S.B. 1123 on Jan. 20, which would allow anyone with a permit to possess concealed carry weapons anywhere on college campuses. The committee asserted that this would make the community and students on campus safer. This step taken by the Senate Judiciary Committee should concern all Arizona college students and community members alike, as it will only perpetuate an unsafe campus likely leading to more violence, homicides and suicides. During a Senate Judiciary Meeting,Michael Thompson, the chief of police at Arizona State University since 2014, insisted that S.B. 1123 was not going to benefit college campuses at all. “I’m here to tell you from first-hand experience that university students make very poor decisions on a daily basis, sometimes hourly basis,” Thompson said. “Adding guns to an already high-risk environment of alcohol, drugs, overreaction, lack of life experience and immaturity is a very dangerous combination.” There are extensive risks involved with allowing students and community members to have guns on campus. The impacts of mental illness have affected several college students and is a significant issue within the age group of college students.Mayo Clinic Health Systemsreported that 30% of college students relayed feeling depressed and half of college students relayed feeling severely anxious in the last year. Access to firearmsincreasesthe risk of suicide. The availability of students to possess firearms on campus in the context of student mental health rates will lead to deadly outcomes. The connection between students’ mental health rates and access to firearms is clear, and we cannot allow weapons on campus due to the possibility of increased suicide rates. RELATED:OPINION: The University of Arizona needs to stand in support of the Equal Rights Amendment Community advocate for gun violence prevention, Ezri Tyler, also raises concerns about mental health and concealed carry on college campuses in Arizona, as she recognized that, “our communities do not have the support systems or education built out surrounding mental health.” The high mortality-rate of firearms as a means of suicide needs to be of utmost concern to policy makers in making the decision to allow concealed carry weapons on campus. Taking into consideration the stresses of college and the lack of education built around mental health the odds of a student attempting to take their life is raised, especially with access to concealed weapons anywhere on campus. Unintentional and intentional violence and worsened issues of sexual assault will only heighten if students are able to conceal carry weapons. Especially on campus, allowing concealed handguns would increase the danger of gun theft, accidental shootings and intentional shootings. With issues that are already on college campuses, the danger of gun violence will only enhance problems. “For students, allowing concealed carry poses many dangers, but each of them already exists- adding a weapon to the equation only magnifies the existing issues,” Tyler reaffirmed. As most college students know, college dorms are generally small. With access to weapons comes the responsibility of weapon storage. However, with very small communal living spaces, there is a risk of improper and unsafe storage and gun theft. College dorms are constantly filled with visitors and others from around campus and the likelihood that someone could gain unauthorized access to these firearms is likely. Also, sexual and aggravated assaults could possibly become more violent with access to concealed carry anywhere on campus. With the whole student population being able to acquire firearms, there is an increased likelihood that armed victims of sexual violence will be much more vulnerable to attack and abuse. The most important action students can take right now is to, “comment on the AZLegislature website, set up meetings with representatives, and reach out to the amazing Arizona organizations working to organize within the community,” Tyler conveyed. If our college community truly wants to be free of violence, we need to realize that the issues of gun violence cannot be solved with more guns. It takes, “holistic, preemptive, and intersectional approaches,” Tyler stated. “Gun violence is the effect of systemic inequities and oppression and those issues, issues that are deep-rooted cannot be solved by just adding more violence.” Follow Sophia Hammer onTwitter Sophia is a freshman majoring in family studies & human development and global Studies.

wildcat_arizona_2022_18,"In the first edition of this article, I explored some of the best and worst movie theaters in Tucson. Wrapping up the list are five more theaters that made it into my top five favorite theaters. If you’re curious to read about the others that made it onto this list, check outpart one. 5.Nightjar Tavern Nightjar Tavern, after Casa Video and Film Bar, is the other place on this list that’s not only a movie theater. It’s a restaurant run by the same people who runthe Coronet Restaurant, and it is such a cool place to see a movie. Every Friday, Nightjar shows a different movie at 10:00 p.m. with a special late-night menu. The food and drinks are great (I recommend the wedge salad and the prosecco , but the best part of Nightjar is the movies they show. The movies Nightjar shows are usually cool, weird movies that won’t often get screentime at other venues, and that’s a big contrast with the classy pub atmosphere. If you’ve ever wanted to eat fresh mussels whilst watching “Pacific Rim” or Disney’s “Holes,” Nightjar Tavern is the place to be. Nightjar is also the only place on this list where I recommend seeing an outdoor movie. Their projector looks amazing on their patio and an atmosphere of people all there to watch late-night movies in a fancy pub makes it very fun. 4.The Screening Room The Screening Room has gone through multipleiterations, some of which have exclusively shown movies and some of which have just been event spaces that didn’t show movies at all. Currently, The Screening Room is showing movies again, and I’m thrilled. It’s a great location. On the busy, loud street of Congress in Downtown Tucson is this nice, quiet movie theater that mostly plays classics. From old noir to eighties sci-fi, The Screening Room is a very fun place to see something right in the heart of downtown. 3.Galaxy Theaters Tucson I had never been to Galaxy Theaters Tucson before I started researching for this piece. I live just north of the University of Arizona campus, and Galaxy, located far east on Broadway and Houghton, is far off my radar. However, when I went there, I was blown away by how much I enjoyed the experience. Galaxy presents itself as a fairly standard, mainstream cinema, but the differences compound as you get closer to the auditorium. Speaking with manager Karen Foley, it became apparent why: Galaxy is a chain, but it’s a very small one compared to others. Foley referred to it as her theater. When I asked why, she said, “This is one of my first times working for a smaller company, and I love it! I could call the owner right now, and he’d pick up the phone and talk to me. You don’t always get that when you work for a large corporation; I feel like my voice is heard.” That affinity shows in the quality of Galaxy. The snack bar offers a creative way to “dine-in.” You can pick up popcorn and nachos at the concession stand, but hot, fresh foods like pizza and pretzels will be brought to your seat. It’s a great streamlining of the dine-in experience that allows you to not wait for food at the beginning of your showing nor be interrupted by other people ordering. What really won me over about Galaxy wasits projectors. I read online that Galaxy had the only all-laser projectors in Arizona, but I didn’t know what that meant until I sat down and watched a movie there. It’s an amazing experience. The projectors use lasers as opposed to other forms of light, and the visual is incredibly crisp. The movie I saw was in 3D, and I felt compelled to reach out and touch the screen at certain points like a child at an IMAX movie; I’m still impressed that something like a projector can bring out that child in me. 2.Century Park Place If you live in Tucson and you see movies, I’m sure you’ve been to Century Park Place. Park Place seems to be the default for seeing a movie in Tucson. It’s comfortable, it’s in a mall, so it’s easy to have fun and shop before your movie and it’s always packed. Park shows that the average person is still seeing movies in theaters simply by being a popular, reliable choice. Is there anything particularly special about Park? I suppose not, but I don’t think that matters. Park is a great place to see a movie because it’s a quintessential modern American theater, and I think it does everything it should. I firmly believe that it earns a high ranking here. 1.The Loft Cinema I wholeheartedly believe that we are lucky to have The Loft here in Tucson. The Loft is a renowned institution of arthouse movie theaters and is a Tucson staple. For many Tucsonans, The Loft is a personal staple. Jeff Yanc, the program director at the Loft Cinema, told me that it’s normal for him to recognize people and see regulars. “A great part of the job is getting to know the audience. A lot of people come to The Loft because the event is at The Loft, even more so than the film itself. That’s what makes the job gratifying to me: the fondness people have for the theater,” Yanc said. The Loft has cool, offbeat programming that most theaters just don’t have. Every single month“Rocky Horror”is shown with a live shadow cast. On weekend nights, cult classics are played at 10:00 p.m., and every Monday (my personal favorite event , a horrible movie is shown, and people make jokes at the screen. It’s calledMondo Mondays, and it’s always the highlight of my week. During our conversation, Yanc told me that he believes it’s important that The Loft can show that every movie has an audience, not just the new foreign and indie movies The Loft shows every day, but also the bad movies most people would never want to see. “There’s a community for every kind of film,” is a quote from him that I want on a T-shirt. The Loft also holds the distinction of being a nonprofit. This means that The Loft receives donations and volunteers. During the aforementioned closure, donations helped the theater continue and showed that people in this community really care about the theater. The Loft recently celebrated its50th anniversary, and it thrives off of these donations and fans as it helps keep Tucson vibrant. Each of these theaters has a different purpose for the Tucson community, and each is a good choice to see a movie depending on your preferences.

crimson_2022_26,"Reiterated in socially conscious spaces until it makes me want to gouge my ears out: “Nonbinary people don’t owe you androgyny!” I’m sure people who say this are supportive and generally understanding of the plight of gender in modern American society. Perhaps a student in a Women, Gender, and Sexuality seminar says this to snaps around the table. Perhaps they were themself filled with nonbinary rage at the machine of society that demands this exacting display of equal male and female characteristics from us. I bought into this rage, heavy, when I was younger and starting to toe the edges of gender; I didn’t owe anyone else a window into my gender identity. Now, I am a cynic: To be broadly seen as nonbinary, you must present as androgynous. *** I refuse to argue the existence of nonbinary gender identity. Eighty-two percent of transgender individuals have considered suicide, as have 94 percent of nonbinary individuals; 40 percent of each group has attempted. The existence of 1.2 million people who identify as nonbinary in the United States alone, regardless of whether that identity can be considered “real” (and really, what is real when we talk social constructs , is enough to warrant solving the issues they face. We kill trans and nonbinary people with our inaction. Thousands upon thousands of bodies slump over for the last time, as we argue over whether we even see them. *** There is a gap between self-defined identity, which describes how one internally identifies, and other-imposed identity, which refers to how they are externally perceived. In a typical example concerning race, one might self-define as consider themself Chinese because they were raised in a culturally Chinese household that celebrated the Lunar New Year and split mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival. That same person might be widely perceived as some flavor of vaguely East Asian based on the tint of their skin or the skew of their eyes. In determining other-imposed gender identity, we are evaluated in accordance with the established looks of men and women. We all know what male and female look like — or at least, we think we do, according to the notions of gender expression developed by our surrounding societies. Every recorded civilization has had at least the two genders of male and female. Gender has a look refined over human history, as conveyed by hair, makeup, clothing, size, stature, bone structure, et cetera. Men have muscles, body hair, and rugged faces; women have curves, long silky hair, and a softness to their edges. I can’t escape this judgment. No one has ever seen me, with my medium wolf cut, winged eyeliner, and high-waisted pants, and thought anything other than “woman.” If I wanted them to think otherwise, I would need to change parts of me. I’d cut flesh from my chest, build structure in my jaw, shave my head, grow five more inches. I’d flee my own body. *** People describe others with their own perceptions, until they learn that others’ self-defined identities differ, and they care enough to update their perceptions. Human beings are duck testable: If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck — and to call a duck anything other than a duck is ridiculous. Even at Harvard, where students campaign for social justice, the duck test is used without asking whether someone identifies as a duck first. The most socially progressive people I know have defaulted to “she/her” for me. I don’t blame them for it. It’s easy to advocate for respecting gender identities at large; it’s hard to deliver the requisite respect in individual situations when the right answer seems already too apparent, when we’ve been raised to assume that gender is generally obvious. We could use neutral pronouns for each other until otherwise specified. In theory, this would solve all thorniness; in practice, no one ever does it. Onlyaround half of all Americansare even somewhat comfortable using gender-neutral pronouns when specifically asked to do so; it seems reasonable to assume that the percentage of Americans comfortable with using gender-neutral pronouns even before being asked to do so is much lower. Overall, the trendline for national comfort with gender neutrality is depressingly static. Coupled with the disinclination to explain one’s entire identity to a new group of peers, the duck test seems unlikely to leave us anytime soon, at Harvard or beyond. *** If you want to be widely perceived as nonbinary, you need to present like the single socially-understood look. Nonbinary people might not have the same history of civilizations established on male and female to define what our gender identity looks like — but we have a look nonetheless, defined in the space between male and female. It’s androgyny: the perfect blend between masculine and feminine. Think of every “gender envy” Pinterest board of skinny, pale, smudged-out teens with dark hair and worried knuckles. You want to be perceived as neither male nor female, but neutrally? You need a neutral body. Never mind the fact that this might not be how you personally identify. Nonbinary identity rarely files perfectly down the center of the male-female continuum. Rather, nonbinary identity encapsulates a large swathe of gender identities, from feeling like both man and woman in different amounts, to feeling no gender at all. It’s a three-dimensional identity that we attempt to collapse down to the two-dimensional scale between male and female. Never mind the fact that you might not want to change the body you grew up in, which has served you for all these years. Many nonbinary people do not want to pursue hormone therapy or gender-affirming procedures. They are not nonbinary souls “stuck in the wrong bodies,” as the popular myths would claim; their bodies are their own, made nonbinary by their identities. Finally, never mind the fact that body change to the androgynous ideal might not even be possible. A thin, white, childlike body is unachievable by much of the nonbinary population due to genetics alone. For many nonbinary people, striving towards an androgynous body is a hopeless act towards an unreachable fantasy. The fantasy isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, either. Even if you fit the model of androgyny to a tee, you are not guaranteed an other-imposed nonbinary identity. People still perceive you without your clarification all the time, while passing you on the street or participating beside you in section. Androgyny only works as shorthand for nonbinary if the audience’s duck tests are updated to recognize this latest model of nonbinary appearance. You’re entrusting the reception of your identity to people who, statistically speaking, are in the 73 percent of Americans who have heard little to nothing about nonbinary identity. One in five Americans know someone who identifies as nonbinary; likely even fewer grasp the nuances of how that person conceptualizes their complex gender identity. Here is the crux of the nonbinary tragedy: We need to perform to be recognized, that performance might not be how we want to be recognized in the first place, and even then, the performance doesn’t always work to generate recognition. We want to be perceived as we perceive ourselves, so badly. But the journey is treacherous, consuming our bodies and agency for a chance at public acceptance. Maybe that’s why 94 percent of us want to kill ourselves: It’s the last act of agency we can afford in a system that grants us none. *** I do not want nonbinary people to die. I want nothing but euphoria and gentle endings for my nonbinary siblings. History bears witness to how people like me have tried for a kinder future. Activists have redefined gender neutrality and resisted gender norms since the 1970s. Younger generations are rewiring how we think about gender beyond the man-woman binary. But we need more. I am tired of waiting for the dead to accumulate. Perhaps it’s too existentially difficult for us to decouple the body from the identity, to wipe our mechanisms of perception, such that nonbinary people are freed from their Sisyphean torture. But we can control the extent to which these perceptions are verbalized. We can default to gender-neutral language. We can refrain from commenting on each others’ bodies. We can change the behemoth of culture one surface-level action at a time, until it becomes second nature and itself culture. If we can create this culture change anywhere, it’s at the microcosm of Harvard, a campus so overwhelmingly liberal that we had a near-scandal over the lack of conservative voices. Use “they/them” before anyone else. Check your biases before making assumptions about others’ gender identities based on their bodies. Do it for the at least 2.7 percent of current Harvard students who identify as nonbinary. Do it to save lives. *** This LGBTQ+ History Month, as we celebrate the queer trailblazers who have carved our passage towards civil rights into the deepest granite of time, I also want us to look to the future birthed by today’s history. I want us to make the choices now that will lead to broad acceptance of nonbinary people and reduce trans and nonbinary death down the line. Until then, nonbinary people are saddled with this ugly tragedy, the dichotomy of choice between self-respect and others’ respect. I don’t want to owe you androgyny, but you’re going to ask for it anyways. Christina M.

rice_thresher_2022_22,"BySophia Peng,Sejal GuptaandDenise Maldonado9/13/22 11:07pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Rice undergrads often treat community service as a box to tick for graduate school applications or a story to impress interviewers. It is easy to conduct our service within the Rice bubble – researching and designing solutions without venturing beyond the hedges to the community members we are trying to help. However, to truly make an impact, students need to identify community needs and find service opportunities that act with, and not on, the community. As we enter the school year and begin scouting volunteer opportunities, we want to share an experience that taught us the value of grassroots involvement. This summer, we were assigned a research project on wealth inequity and Fifth Ward. At first, all we knew was that Fifth Ward has a history as a cancer cluster (an area with high rates of cancer , faces systematic injustice and is predominantly low-income. So, as Rice students do, we made assumptions from journal articles and statistics. But as we sat to write our research proposal, we realized we didn t even know what the neighborhood looked like. In July, we found an Instagram ad for a bike tour of Houston s historic Fifth Ward – hosted every third Saturday of the month by local nonprofitOur Afrikan Family.Three community activists, Kendra London, Sandra Edwards and Latricia St. Jules led our tour through the cancer cluster. We learned thatUnion Pacific Railroadhad, without regulation, operated a wood-preserving facility that contaminated the soil, air and water of the local area. The contamination createdheightened rates of cancer. Though the company shut the facility down in 1984, multi-generational trauma, illness and suffering continue to this day. On one block alone, community elders pointed out that almost every house had been affected by cancer. We met a resident of Fifth Ward who expressed frustration that her community’s high rate of illness was blamed on poor eating habits. She tried to grow a garden to take ownership of her diet, but the vegetables came out rotten. This area is a death trap,” she said. “The majority of my family, including myself, experience breathing problems. My mother suffered from a heart attack. Cancer does not run in our families, but our people are dying of cancer. The government blames our health problems on us, and says it s our lifestyle. It s an insult to injury. Throughout the tour, her words and the lasting impact of environmental violence on Fifth Ward stuck with us. The tour showed us what articles did not: a common trend of residents advocating for their needs when political leaders and corporations refused to take accountability. Heading back to campus, we noticed a crowd of children painting in the park. There, we met Angela Rice, the founder ofOut of the Mouth of B.A.B.E.S.– a nonprofit dedicated to providing creative mental health outlets and counseling opportunities to neighborhood youth. Angela Rice, like other activists we met, saw Fifth Ward as a place of family, not of disrepair. The motivation for OTM B.A.B.E.S., she outlined to us, is to empower youth in her community to speak up for themselves. If the bike tour introduced us to local advocacy networks within Fifth Ward, running into Angela Rice confirmed how far they spanned. Moreover, our previous research never put the issue of mental health in Fifth Ward on our radar. Engaging with Angela Rice and her local organization provided us with a more accurate understanding of the community’s needs. Leaving the Rice bubble and witnessing the physical, psychological and socioeconomic consequences of environmental injustice, structural racism and corporate profiteering in Fifth Ward gave our research a sense of urgency. Moreover, we established contact with on-the-ground initiatives – groups that seldom cross paths with a large institution like Rice, but could benefit immensely from our collaboration. Local organizers know best what their communities need. The Rice bubble, while resourceful and nurturing, is sheltered. Connecting with on-the-ground organizations is vital when designing solutions or researching a community, especially when the community is marginalized. Grassroots groups apply their multifaceted contexts of local issues to create a sense of trust in the community. As students, we need to put in the work to find local organizations. They are definitely less well-advertised than larger, corporate-funded entities. Look on social media, talk to Houston in Action or other locally-based service groups, or go to a community event – and see who you meet. Ultimately, before we attempt community service, let’s ask ourselves: Who are we empowering with our work? Community members? Or ourselves? April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2022_0,"It is all-too-often remarked that we live in an era of unprecedented interconnectedness. Online communities for virtually any interest or hobby are easily accessible. Audiences of hundreds or thousands are in our pockets. No matter where in the world we are, our friends and even our distant relations are just a few taps away. But the era we live in feels like anything but one of connection. Instead, we’re lonelier than we’ve ever been. Even before the pandemic, nearly aquarterof American adults reported feeling lonely “often” or “always,” and the number of people who say they have zero close friends hasquadrupledfrom just 3% in 1990 to 12% (more than one-in-10 in 2021. Between dorms, classes and clubs, Stanford is likely one of the places in the country least affected by this epidemic of loneliness. And yet, there is still the pervasive sense that something is missing, that our dining halls shouldn’t have quite so many people eating two seats apart. Something has gone very, very wrong. The first person to sound the alarm about this era of disconnection was Robert Putnam, in his landmark 1995 paper and subsequent 2000 book, “Bowling Alone.”Putnam describes not just an epidemic of loneliness, but a fundamental deterioration of what he identifies as “social capital,” the bonds of trust and mutual altruism formed between communities of people. Putnam observes declines in seven different indicators of our social capital, such as civic participation, social trust and the abundance of informal social networks. In other words, our social fabric itself seems to be fraying. Since the publication of “Bowling Alone” at the start of the millennium, the picture hasn’t gotten any better. As the Wall Street Journalreported in 2020, nearly half of Americans said most people were trustworthy in 1970. That figure has since dropped to just one-third, making us the only established democracy where social trust has declined over the past half-century. Meanwhile, political polarization has reached a fever pitch as our collective mental health has continued to deteriorate. (Both of these are linked to the decline of social capital — more on that later. Somehow, disconnection became the quintessential sensation of our time. And it didn’t occur overnight. Rather, it is the result of a systemic deterioration — the disappearance of community. An explanation for how our communities are disappearing — and why — is laid out in social scientist Marc Dunkelman’s 2014 book, “The Vanishing Neighbor.”There, he describes three types of social relationships: inner-ring, middle-ring and outer-ring. The people we form inner-ring relationships with are our confidants. They are often our closest friends, family members and romantic partners. Middle-ring relationships are our community: classmates, fellow congregants, coworkers, fellow members of civic organizations and the like. They are the people with whom we are friendly, but not intimate. Finally, our outer-ring relationships are our acquaintances: people we might recognize, but don’t know much about. The clerk at the local grocery store, for example, or a distant relation on Facebook. The most dramatic and yet largely unnoticed sociological trend of the past three decades, Dunkelman argues, is the collapse of the middle ring. The first factor driving the middle ring’s collapse is a decline in our opportunities to form middle-ring relationships. The rise of American car culture has created vast distances between people’s homes, places of work and places of relaxation, diminishing the chance encounters and sense of community that might otherwise emerge within a small town, neighborhood or city block. Instead of striking up a conversation on the street, we wave through our car window. Rather than browse around the local shops or walk down Main Street, we drive to Walmart or Costco. What was once social has become industrial. Digital. Standardized. Had Dunkelman written “The Vanishing Neighbor”in 2022, he might note that with the rise of remote work and online retail, we increasingly don’t go anywhere at all. The result? We’ve begun to think of our cities and towns as places we live in, rather than places we’re a part of. And so our middle-ring relationships begin to vanish. But even if we stopped finding local communities organically, we might still find community intentionally, through organizations. Yet some of the organizations best positioned to fill such a role — local churches —are disappearing too. In the process, we’re losing the community networks, rites of passage and interdependence churches serve to create. As an atheist, I’m not concerned with the disappearance of churches themselves. Rather, I’m frightened that we’ve neglected to replace them with anything at all. To truly put the nail in the coffin, at the same time as car culture and declining church attendance have diminished our opportunities to form middle-ring relationships, the digital era has taken our attention away from those middle-ring relationships we do have. For one thing, we’re constantly connected to more strangers and acquaintances than we’ve ever been. But the interactions we have on social media rarely blossom into community or friendship. The political argument we have with some random person on Twitter rarely turns into a better understanding of the other person the way a political conversation with a real human might. Similarly, the vacation photo we post on Instagram is far less likely to foment any real connection than telling the story to people in the same room. But social media isn’t solely to blame. Perplexingly, in the midst of this era of loneliness, those of us who do have friendsreport more frequent interactions with them. Perhaps this is because when a spouse leaves the home for the day, they don’t remain out of touch with their partner until they return. Instead, they may text or even talk throughout the day. The same thing happens with our friends: they’re never more than a few button taps away. This is, in principle, a good thing. The problem is that our social attention is a limited resource. When we spend more time on the friends we have, we pay less attention to our community and spend less time looking for friends in the new places we find ourselves in. In the long run, this rarely works out for us: friends don’t always last forever, and when we go looking for new people, we increasingly find ourselves with no community to look for them within. Estimates for the time required to make a new friend hover around 50 hours, which makes simply going up to an acquaintance and attempting to befriend them a daunting task. What are you going to do? Schedule weekly lunches for an entire year? This is why so many of our friends come from our communities. Groups of people hanging out together for some other purpose offer the perfect “incubation zone” in which friendships can form. As community vanishes, the foundation is pulled out from underneath our ability to make new friends, and we’re left ever more alone. All that said, none of the obstacles we’ve discussed are so salient that creating community in spite of them is impossible. Clubs are still abundant at Stanford. Civic organizations and community groups are still around in local communities, if you know where to look. Some new forms of community have even emerged: online groups formed around hobbies, fandoms or social media content creators. But by and large, these networks have moved out into our third ring, their members our acquaintances rather than our friends. In the process, they’ve lost their ability to support us in the ways that aren’t easy, to make us less alone. All this goes to say that if we had wanted to maintain community, we could have, and in some places we did. But not enough. Not everywhere. Perhaps as community started to fade, it turned out we didn’t value it enough to save it. Perhaps we chose to let it die. It could be this value shift that we feel here at Stanford when we sense something is missing. Maybe all the right pieces are here to make something beautiful, but in the midst of this digital era, we’ve forgotten how to put them together. Yet something about all this rings hollow. We say we value community. We have classes and clubs and dorms, the exact spaces that should create community naturally! We have no car culture to isolate us, no suburbanization to separate us. One could blame everything on phones, texting and social media — certainly, having YouTube to watch in the dining halls when we eat makes us less likely to take up a conversation with an acquaintance over lunch. But it seems more likely there is something else at play: the disappearance of community as a way of being. What do I mean by a way of being? I mean the collection of learned habits that form our collective defaults for moving through the world, things we bring with us to Stanford when we arrive. It is not that phones are actively stopping us from striking up conversations when we eat alone in the dining halls. (One could have just as easily read a book or written during a lunch alone before. Rather, it is that the broader cultural shift has made striking up a conversation with a stranger a departure from the norm. And this occurs in much more important and fundamental ways than what we do at lunch. Simply put, we’ve gotten used to operating without the middle ring. I remember my parents telling me stories from when they went to college, how most nights someone would be playing a movie or performing in the lounge, how they’d wander down and strike up a conversation or a pool game with whoever was around. When I arrived at Stanford, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I had hoped to find something similar. Instead, the lounges sat empty, or occupied by a friend group or two doing their own thing. Outside of the occasional poster on someone’s door, the only sense that people lived in the space came from the exit signs that had been ripped off of the ceiling. The entire dorm would pour into the lounge when pizza arrived for on-call, only to disappear again within ten minutes. By the end of the year, most of the people in Crothers were still just a name and a face to me. Perhaps the size of Crothers made things especially desolate, but the general experience is, I think, familiar. As we’ve become used to dedicating our time to being with our closest friends or being alone, the middle ring has, even here, withered. The disappearance of community, both at Stanford and across the country, isn’t just sad. It’s deadly. A sustained feeling of loneliness is associated with a health risk equivalent tosmoking 15 cigarettes a day. Recall that over a quarter of U.S. adults report feeling lonely “often” or “always” and you’ll begin to get a sense of the scale of the problem. But why is loneliness so dangerous? Part of it, of course, is the emotional distress inflicted by social isolation. A 2019 literature reviewpublishedin the Journal of Affective Disorders analyzed 40 previous studies linking loneliness and suicide risk, and found that social isolation, both in actual terms and the perceived feeling of loneliness, is “strongly associated with suicidal outcomes.” On top of that, when we’re lonely, we’re less likely to eat well, to take care of ourselves, to have people to support us when we’re not feeling well. Moreover, the stress response produced by loneliness can wreak havoc on our health in its own right: as Vivek Murthy, Surgeon General of the United States,explainedin an interview with Vox: “When you have a protracted stress state, levels of inflammation rise. That inflammation starts to injure tissues and blood vessels, which increases our risk for chronic illnesses like heart disease. It can impair your body’s immune response. It can even cause long-term sleep deprivation, which puts us at greater risk of hypertension, obesity and a host of other physical conditions.” Not everyone needs social interaction in the same ways, or experiences loneliness the same. But we all need support networks: the fellow congregant that notices when we’re not ourselves, that friend we know has our back, a shoulder to cry on. Murthy alsopoints outthat when we’re lonely, we often struggle to seek help: “There’s a tremendous sense of shame that people who are lonely feel. I say that as someone who felt ashamed of being lonely as a child and even at points during adulthood. I think part of the reason is that saying you’re lonely feels like saying you’re not likable, you’re not lovable — that somehow you’re socially deficient in some way.” The reality, of course, isn’t that we are all somehow flawed and unlikeable. The reality is we are living in a world that is increasingly devoid of community. By and large, we’ve lost the spaces where we can find ourselves comfortablyamongothers even when we aren’twithothers. To make matters worse, our collective isolation has profound impacts not just on our mental health, but on our collective institutions. Our democracy, to put it mildly, is not healthy. The most notable example is, of course, the insurrection on Jan. 6, but the roots of that fateful day reveal a much broader and more insidious trend. No longer are our disagreements restricted primarily to what we should do about the facts. They have expanded to fundamental misunderstandings of the facts themselves. Examples are perhaps too numerous to count: did President Biden win the election? Is climate change real and anthropogenic? Are vaccines effective? Is critical race theory being taught to elementary students? Is our government secretly controlled by a shadowy cabal of pedophiles who drink the blood of infants in order to remain immortal? When we are disconnected from others, especially from those with whom we disagree, we are far more vulnerable to misinformation, because we lack the alternative perspectives that might prompt us to question our beliefs. Those alternative perspectives can’t just come from anywhere, either. We are unlikely to be moved by an opposing politician or a Twitter thread from someone we don’t know — it is all too easy to dismiss them as “the other.” Rather, to question our own beliefs, we need them to be challenged by people we trust. Since our inner rings are likely to be people who are very similar to us already, and we don’t have an established basis of trust with our outer rings, our vanishing middle rings are the only place we might find those diverse perspectives. The more isolated you are, the worse the problem gets — there is a reason that neo-Nazi and conspiracy groups have been known toencouragerecruits to cut themselves off from family and friends who aren’t members. Some of the most compelling evidence that our division is the result of disconnection comes from James Fishkin, a communication professor here at Stanford. I currently work at his Deliberative Democracy Lab (DDL , through which Fishkin has conducted over a hundred experiments in what he calls “Deliberative Polling.” Unlike a regular poll, which just asks questions of its participants, a Deliberative Poll puts the participants in the same room for a moderated discussion, and asks its questions both before and after the event. The results are remarkable: political polarization drops massively, not just on the issues, but also in terms of ‘affective polarization’ — how negatively the participants viewed their political opponents. In one of the largest Deliberative Polling experiments to date,America in One Room, Republicans’ feelings towards Democrats rose by 13 points on a zero-to-100 scale, whereas Democrats’ views of Republicans rose by a similar 14 points. Interestingly, the effect was largest among those with the most extreme political views. Indeed, “those who took the most extreme issue positions,” Fishkin and his colleagues speculate, “may have been even more isolated from serious contact with the other side than were party members in general.” On 23 out of the 26 issues studied, Republicans and Democrats left with more consensus on average than when they started. For those highly polarized voters, it was on every single issue. America in One Room, believe it or not, took place over a single weekend. The fact that such little time together can so greatly transform our views of the issues and each other speaks not only to the power of human connection, but also to how sorely it is lacking. What might a return to community in America look like? I can’t say I have all the answers. The social institutions of the past, whether they be religious, local or political, were and still are frequently exclusionary and destructive. We would be remiss to paint over the signs on the doors that once read “whites only” with a veneer of togetherness. Moreover, simply fortifying old community institutions against the disappearance of social capital would be treating the symptoms rather than the problem. As society changes, so too will the forms of community it contains. But they need to exist, and their existence is critical to our health, our society and our own happiness. Perhaps part of the solution lies in changing how we build our cities and towns, by creating public spaces with community in mind. Inthe Barcelona Superblockmodel, the clever arrangement of one-way streets is used to reclaim public space and make cities more walkable without unduly hampering logistics. But it isn’t the only paradigm, and the general ethos that inspires it is shared by a whole philosophy of urban planning, known as ‘New Urbanism.’ Perhaps another part of the solution looks like Fishkin’s Deliberation Day: the idea that we make Election Day a federal holiday dedicated to more than just going to the polls. Under the proposal, voters would be given a stipend to spend time talking with other local community members in moderated discussions before they vote, much like how Deliberative Polls operate. There, individuals could hear the perspectives of others and think pragmatically about solutions. Rather than democracy being about competition, we could make it about community. Similarly, as places of worship fade from their central small-town role in America, we could actively work to find new spaces to take their place: libraries, community centers and civic organizations can all play a role. In my hometown of Carnation, the local farmer’s market is a staple of town life. You might come just to buy veggies, but you’ll inevitably wind up seeing a friendly face or two and spend time talking as you listen to the live music. The creation of community pillars like the Carnation Farmers’ Market requires persistence and no small degree of luck, but it is possible. Possible, of course, only if we value community enough to build it. Here at Stanford, we have all the building blocks already in place (a walkable campus, close living quarters, vibrant community organizations and opportunities for engaged discussion . This could be the perfect place to begin the process of rebuilding, to explore the new kinds of social infrastructure and cultural norms that will be required to keep connection alive in the new world we’re building for ourselves. But those are all big ambitions. And we can start small. Perhaps that looks like being the person who starts a movie in the lounge on Sunday nights and invites anyone in the mood to join, or making an effort to strike up conversations with the people in your classes you don’t know all that well. Perhaps that looks like advocating for the neighborhood system we were promised, or engaging in community events like Cardinal Nights. This may be an enormous, structural problem that spans an entire country, but it isn’t climate change. Community is by its nature local and personal. Individual choices matter. We don’t have to let community fade, if we value it enough to save it. So as we find ourselves tumbling into an unknown and often terrifying future, let us at least pause long enough to make sure we’re not tumbling alone.

crimson_2022_123,"The news of Russia invading Ukraine has shaken Harvard’s campus: immediately following the news break, students outpoured support on social media and protest plans quickly formed. Soon after, University President Lawrence S. Bacow publicly declared the University’s support for the Ukrainian government and announced that the Ukrainian flag would be flown above the John Harvard statue. However, as a Middle Eastern student, I couldn’t help but draw parallels between Harvard s different reactions for wars initiated by the American government in the Middle East and those in white European countries. Moments after I gazed at the news of Ukraine on the TV screen, I couldn t help but remember similar footage that came out of my own country of Afghanistan earlier last year. Afghanistan was entrenched in over 20 years of conflict with the American government, resulting in the collapse of the Afghan institution, the death of over 241,000 people, and the displacement of nearly six million Afghans. The invasion came to an end last year when President Joe Biden withdrew all troops from the country, leaving the Taliban to overtake control and sparking a massive humanitarian crisis that is expected to kill millions in the coming months. In response to the Taliban’s takeover, the Biden administration froze the assets of Afghan citizens and sanctioned the country, causing an economic collapse and the death of even more Afghans. Though, unlike Ukraine, the Afghan people and students did not receive any statements of support from Harvard’s president, and no flag was waved on campus. Instead, Harvard ignored the conflict and signaled that the institution will only take a stand when it concerns white victims. Similarly, Harvard s student body, which has historically been disproportionately wealthy and white, also ignored the conflict. While there were many petitions signed by students and different on-campus organizations imploring the University to support Ukrainian, Russian, and Belarusian students, Middle Eastern students suffering from similar tragedies were once again left out of any support beyond their own cultural organizations. I believe the racist rhetoric perpetuated by the American media — which alludes inhumanity to one group and humanity to the other — is to blame for much of the dialogue around campus. Though, still, I couldn’t help but wonder why the conflicts in nonwhite countries seem too foreign and far removed to my classmates, yet the Ukrainian war is rightfully deserving of support. The answer was loud and clear: one is white, and the other is not. Such clear bias and racism among the student body here at Harvard not only shows the daily struggles Harvard’s students of color face, but also reflects the institution’s historically racist campus. The support the Ukrainian people received is not only important but required. However, Middle Eastern students like myself, who have family back home and are victims of war, have every right to call out the institution they attend and their fellow peers on their racist bias. Many of us went through similar tragedies in life and had to flee our countries, yet Middle Eastern students did not receive nearly as much public support as white refugees from Harvard and its community. If Harvard’s goal is truly teaching future world leaders in a diverse living environment it needs to ensure that it supports all of its students equally regardless of their skin color or religion. For years, Harvard has fostered a community that not only supports subtle and outright racism but also helps it thrive. Harvard and its student body need to acknowledge their racist biases and Harvard needs to invest in communities that its actions have long oppressed.

state_press_2022_56,"Arizona voters and ASU students should cast their ballots in favor of democratic ideals this November. Anti-democratic propositions and candidates on the ballot in Arizona should be seen as direct attacks on democratic processes in the state and the U.S., and voters should oppose them when voting this election cycle. Propositions 128, 129 and 132 each act in different ways to dramatically weaken one of the most potent tools for progressive change in the U.S. and Arizona. Proposition 128would allow the Legislature to alter voter-approved initiatives found to be illegal or unconstitutional with a simple majority vote. This gives a lot more room for the Legislature to strike down initiatives, even if they were passed by the majority of voters. Proposition 129is more specific to how voter initiatives are formatted. If passed, it would ensure voter initiatives could only address one subject at a time. At face value, our world is not a single-issue world, and voter initiatives that inevitably need totackle more than one issue at once would be at risk of running aground. The most explicitly anti-democratic of the three isProposition 132. It would require 60% of voters to approve any new taxes through the initiative process. This proposition would serve as a great boon to conservative lawmakers who prioritize tax cuts for the rich, a policy voters have recentlydisapprovedof, through requiring more than a simple majority. Each of the anti-democratic propositions were put on the ballot after being referred by the Legislature. The legislators who referred the propositions to the ballot, ironically enough, were voted in by some of the same people they are now trying to suppress. I think legislators are noticing that more people are becoming aware and more people are wanting their voice to be heard, and maybe that s an issue for what their power dynamic is like, said Eman Massoud, a sophomore studying criminology and criminal justice who has experience in civic engagement and activism. The Legislature understands when the average Arizonan is asked about policy positions directly, they will often stand to the left of right-wing politicians in office.For example, in 2020, Proposition 208 passed by over 100,000 votes to raise taxes on the rich and better fund public education in Arizona. While the proposition was ultimately overturned in court, the will of Arizona voters showed they want to support Arizona public schools through progressive taxation. This serves as a stark contrast to what some of the Arizona Legislature supports, as it recently passed a school voucher program into law that will funnel public resources into private education. It s a dispiriting reality that in the U.S., state and federal level governments frequently don t support what its citizens do, but it s also not surprising. Capitalist society delegitimizes representative democracy, as those with the most money have the most power and influence in government. A 2014studyfrom Princeton University found that economic elites ... have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy while average citizens have little or no independent influence. It s not just the propositions on the ballot threatening the crumbs left of liberal democracy in Arizona — it s also the candidates running next to them. Kari Lake, Blake Masters and Mark Finchem have each made statements questioning what was secure, sound elections in 2020, and they are alsoeach supported byDonald Trump. You see a lot of these Republican candidates coming from higher backgrounds. They re not everyday people, and obviously, they re going to push for things that benefit them and benefit their party and benefit whatever they stand for, Massoud said. Lake, Masters and Finchem will each go out of their way to destroy direct democracy and voting rights. Lake and Masters will fight to take down unions and public institutions that support working people. Masters himself has called for the end of teachers unions. Attacks on democracy, unions and public institutions must be seen as a combined effort. There are many more working people than there are CEOs and executives, so eroding democratic processes and institutions is a simple logic for supporters of a capitalist system. Arizona voters should vote against anti-democratic candidates and propositions, and they should also fight for anti-capitalist institutions that have the power to anchor democracy.

state_press_2022_21,"Former ASU junior quarterback Jayden Daniels (5 walks out of the tunnel to face USC at Sun Devil Stadium on Saturday, Nov. 6, 2021. Star quarterback Jayden Daniels entered his name in the transfer portal on Feb. 18. Three three-year starter who impressed with a versatile style of play by being a dual-threat quarterback, the team and the University will miss him for the 2022 football season. Coming out of Cajon High School in San Bernardino, California, Daniels was listed as a four-star prospect and second-ranked dual quarterback in the nation, according to247Sports. Among highly-talented players who can make big plays and have the strength to be dangerous in the RPO game with his vision, quick trigger and running ability, Daniels had all the right tools to be successful at the position, according to Charles Power of 247Sports. Daniels struggled with accuracy as a freshman but was able to impress when making plays for the Sun Devils. Learning on the fly is something all freshmen have to learn, regardless of the sport they play. Daniels seemed to continue to play his game and complete60.7%of his passes for 2,943 yards and 17 touchdowns. Not only did he throw 17 touchdowns, he also ran in the ball three times for a score. According to ESPN s Bill Connelly, Daniels was thefifth-bestfreshman quarterback during the 2019 season and ranked as atop 75 quarterbackin the country by PFF s Cam Mellor. Daniels biggest accomplishment was throwing for 408 yards and three touchdowns against the fifth-ranked Oregon Ducks at Sun Devil Stadium. Following an impressive freshman campaign, Daniels looked to improve his play and fire up his team in the Pac-12. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a halt in the Pac-12 2020 season, and the league began its games later than other power five conferences. This resulted in six canceled games, two postponed games and four games being played. In those four games, Daniels threw for 701 yards and five touchdowns to go along with four rushing touchdowns. He led an amazing comeback against theNo. 21 USCwhere the Sun Devils would lose by one point and destroy rival UA 70-7 to close out the season. The 2021 season was a bit of a down year for Daniels. He threw a career-high in interceptions, 10, and only threw for 10 touchdowns. Nevertheless, he did run for 710 yards and six touchdowns. This past season showed how effective he was on the run and what that meant for the Sun Devil offense. A player with this caliber and experience was something the Sun Devils needed to continue to try and push some noise in the Pac-12. Especially being a captain and a three-year starter, that experience alone is what many great teams have. Without a star offensive weapon at the most important position in football, his absence will hurt the Sun Devils next season. It is so important to have a lethal weapon at quarterback because it makes a team more dangerous and hard to stop. The team will need other players to step up with Daniels officially out of the lineup. Players like wide receiversRicky PearsallandLV Bunkley-Sheltonare going to need to have stellar years in order for ASU to be effective on offense. But without Daniels as quarterback again, how will they be able to accomplish this, even though the two are very talented? The transfer of Paul Tyson from Alabama is a great pickup for the Sun Devils, but for someone who backed up Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young all last season with limited attempts, it really is hard to guess how effective this pocket-passer will be for ASU. Sun Devil football is going to have some big shoes to fill for the 2022 season as they will be without Daniels. With the season just months away, their hopes of winning the Pac-12 will keep going down without a star at quarterback. Reach the reporter atalkalmba@asu.eduand follow@adokalm32on Twitter.

crimson_2022_154,"Whenever I compliment my mom’s cooking, she never fails to remind me that whatever typical Dominican meal she made that day is not difficult to make — she learned at only nine years old, after all. Her primary concern is that my future husband (who will apparently be incapable of fending for himself will be perpetually malnourished. I laugh it off and assure her that my husband will be fine, but I am not in fact indifferent to my inability to replicate Mami’s dishes. I worry that the lives of my future children will severely lack the Latin American spirit that characterizes my home, and that in turn, they will be raised without culture. In spite of my mild guilt for not being able to provide them with the rich culture that has so profoundly shaped my own sense of self, I’ve accepted that my kids’ upbringing will inevitably be very different from mine. Being raised in a household run by immigrant Latino parents defined my childhood. Mami and Papi were learning how to navigate life in a new country — a country that was practically a different world for them — just as I was coming into the world. To this day, we have always figured things out together; we have shared both the successes and the setbacks. In many ways, my children’s lives will be easier than mine. They will certainly be more carefree. As a child who didn’t yet know the difference between a savings account and a checking account, I would often be charged with the task of deciphering cryptic letters from Chase Bank that I could barely understand even in English. In the end, I would just translate the parts I could figure out and pray that my parents wouldn’t suddenly go bankrupt because of an important detail I missed. Most of the time, I didn’t at all mind being my parents’ personal translator, and admittedly, it made me feel important. I cannot say the same about other parts of the journey. I’ll always remember the frustration I felt when I sat in front of a stack of tax returns trying to fill out financial aid applications for the first time, and my slight disappointment when my parents couldn’t understand my eighth grade graduation speech in its entirety. More significantly, the pressure to make my parents’ sacrifices “worth it” — to constantly ensure that I am making them proud — is at times draining. I am far from upset that my future children will not relate to these feelings, but I acknowledge that it is a package deal. Along with my burdens, they will also lose some of the benefits of my experience. No matter how much I attempt to produce a microcosm of the Caribbean nation my parents call home, as Mami and Papi successfully did for my siblings and me, I know that it will be impossible for me to fully recreate this atmosphere. So, what I can and will make sure of is that my kids do not lose our language. Although I am many, many years away from becoming a parent, I can say with confidence that I will feel like I have failed if my children are not fluent in Spanish. Needless to say, there are countless practical reasons for learning how to speak the fourth most widely spoken language in the world, including an automatic increase in job opportunities. Plus, knowing Spanish often provides comical moments, like casually letting someone know that I understood their entire conversation about me after quietly listening for five minutes, or deciding to switch it up and order in Spanish at Jefe’s just to witness the employees’ confusion. Beyond these reasons, however, ensuring that my future children are native Spanish speakers is deeply meaningful for me. It would break my heart to see my kids blankly stare at their grandparents when they speak to them. I want them to be able to understand all of Mami and Papi’s stories and their typical Dominican sayings and metaphors in all their glory. I want them to be able to eavesdrop on strangers’ conversations while waiting in line at FedEx in Washington Heights. To listen to Bad Bunny and Romeo Santos and not just enjoy the rhythm, but truly understand the lyrics. To go to the Dominican Republic and feel a genuine connection to the people, the culture, and the land. My parents had no choice but to teach their kids Spanish so they could communicate with us, but I will have a choice. And even if my cooking skills don’t ever match Mami’s, I will ensure that my children can read the recipes to me as I follow them. Ericka S. Familia ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Adams House."
rice_thresher_2022_55,"ByMoses Glickman,Anthony NguyenandEli Johns-Krull2/22/22 11:33pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. On January 21, 2022, the swimming news organization SwimSwam published anarticleincluding remarks by the Rice University women’s swimming coach, Seth Huston. Huston stated that trans swimmer Lia Thomas and other trans athletes should “compete as what they were biologically born until we get to a point where we’ve expanded opportunities.” He defined expanding opportunities as potentially “creating a third division, a transgender division, or whatever.” He further stated he thought it was “wrong” of the College Swimming Coaches Association of America to “suggest Lia compete at NCAAs” in reference to their support of Lia Thomas competing at the Women’s NCAA Championships in March. We urge that Huston retract his statement, we urge Rice to take this opportunity to change internal processes that harm trans students, and we urge readers to bring the facts about trans women athletes to the conversation when others espouse similar sentiments. So what are the facts? Firstly, statements such as Huston’s are in no way backed by science. Numerous restrictions on trans women’s ability to compete in NCAA sports already exist; unless rules are altered by a sport’s governing body, trans women athletes are required to have undergone hormone replacement therapy for at least one year, and to have decreased their testosterone levels substantially. Hemoglobin levels, an indicator of endurance, decrease correspondingly; areviewof the current research found that over the one year of therapy mandated by the NCAA, hemoglobin levels in trans women fall to equal those of cis women. Measures of strength and muscle area also fall to less than that of cis men, negating Huston’s notion that they should compete as their sex assigned at birth. Numerous studies have failed to establishanyconnection between transness and athletic performance;a metastudyof eight research articles found “no direct or consistent research suggesting transgender female individuals (or male individuals have an athletic advantage.” Despite this, right-wing media has largely succeeded in convincing swaths of the public that trans women pose an existential threat to women s sports—that they enjoy what one SA Senate commentator called a “weird advantage.” This belief is simply a myth, one intended by its original proponents as a means to discriminate against trans youth. Further, the continued policing of trans bodies sets a dangerous precedent forallathletes. Even cis women have beenbarred from competitionfor having naturally occurring high testosterone levels, with some undergoinginvasive genital checksbefore being allowed to play. Biological diversity exists in countless different ways, and when it comes to trans athletes, any supposed difference is used to villainize them. The research regarding the physiological effects of HRT and its impact on trans women athletes is still ongoing; nevertheless, these debates don’t change the transphobia of Huston’s statement. It is not necessarily transphobic to discuss guidelines like testosterone suppression and how trans women can compete in women’s sport from a trans-informed perspective, but to suggest the segregation of trans athletes and to reduce them to their sex assigned at birth definitively is. Comments such as his feed into transphobia and punitive statewide policies meant to discriminate against trans athletes. Twelve anti-trans bills were proposed in the Texas legislature in 2021; of these, nine were specifically geared towards keeping young trans people from participating in sports. House Bill 25, the last of these to be proposed, was signed into law in October. Under the new law, public schools must require all students to compete as their biological sex in UIL sports—the same transphobic rule Huston advocated for in his statement. It is already a shame that the achievements of Lia Thomas, who earned her place on the podium, now have an asterisk beside them in the eyes of much of the public due to the misinformed sentiments Huston espouses. The actions of the Texas GOP have done far worse, forcing this state’s talented trans swimmers out of the pool altogether. This all has a crushing cumulative impact, even among those whocancompete: trans athletes across the nation must jump through the numerous hoops the NCAA sets up, ignore transphobic rhetoric in the bleachers and coach’s office alike, and—even then—hope that they won’t be precluded from competition. The upshot is that, far from enjoying a “weird advantage,” trans athletes are not over- butunder-represented in womens’ sports. However heavy the toll of House Bill 25, it is only the tip of the iceberg regarding transphobia in this state’s laws. Conversion therapy remains legal, and the “trans panic” defense—a legal strategy in which an individual who murders a trans person can reduce their liability by arguing that they are driven into violent insanity by the sight of trans people—remains admissible in court. Trans people are not included in Texas’s protections against hate crimes, and since the rejection of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance in 2015, trans people have no protection against housing, employment and other forms of discrimination in this city. It is dangerous to be a trans person in Texas right now, and statements like Huston’s are used repeatedly by conservative actors to further justify discrimination and violence against trans people. Even on campus, these statements are not an exception to the rule. Transphobia is rampant, and University inaction regarding trans student protections only makes these issues more severe. Deadnames of trans students are easily available across campus to both students and employees and have been weaponized against many trans students on campus. Some trans students have been actively threatened by their classmates. Students and faculty seem to believe that the humanity of trans people is up for debate. Though Huston’s intent may not have been to cause harm, his remarks embolden transphobia on campus. To help undo the harm of these statements, we encourage Huston to retract them, apologize to the student body, and undergo allyship training. Further, we urge Rice’s administration to let this event serve as a wake-up call that change is needed in the ways that Rice, its employees, and its institutions perceive trans students. As just one example, the practice of deadnaming in administrative communications, although inadvertent, is nonetheless immensely harmful. Closeted trans students have been outed due to administrative deadnaming in mass emails. Education on trans issues is also woefully insufficient. Change is needed on many fronts. Renouncing these statements is a first step to making trans students safe on this campus, but it cannot be the last. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

wildcat_arizona_2022_80,"Sister Cindy, a TikTok influencer, walks her phones tripod to the grass on March 31 outside the Student Union Memorial Center. Cindy would take the stage a little after 12:45 p.m. and would start a live stream on her TikTok. University of Arizona students are used to religious advocates trying to convert them outside the Student Union Memorial Center. These people often hold a large cross and yell about their extreme religious beliefs to students while they are on the way to class. Mostly, students will rush by in a state of annoyance and avoid these speakers at all costs. However, one religious preacher came to the UA campus and was met with crowds awaiting her arrival. Sister Cindy and Brother Jed have been touring college campuses for decades, preaching their extremely Christian conservative beliefs to just about any college students that will listen, but why are we listening? Sister Cindy simply had herself and a microphone, yet she had an audience of hundreds of young college students. Many were sitting on the concrete sidewalk in the way of passers, causing a massive scene on campus. I was hypnotized in the crowd. I fully participated in the cheers, boos, gasps and shout outs, and time slipped away. I eventually had come to the jarring realization that I had spent almost two hours willingly listening to a 63-year-old woman yell about everything I fundamentally disagree with involving women, sex, god and relationships. Sister Cindy is not an admirable icon – she’s a marketing genius. She takes everything that Gen-Z loves and turns it into a way to get younger people to listen to her extremely conservative religious views. She is an active and “trendy” member of the TikTok community with 389.5k followers (@sistercindyforreal . Her message and public image are the perfect mixes of shock value, controversy and entertainment. This then gives her a platform, following and audience. The energy of the students at Sister Cindy’s speech was comparable to the energy of a football game stadium. The lively response from the crowd was contagious, and students held their breath awaiting her next outlandish statement. Her statements, taken at face value, are wildly sexist, traditionalist, patriarchal and deeply rooted in shame. However, with her whole image, it makes her message something students are willing to skip class to hear. Her slogan “Be a Ho No Mo” can be found on buttons, stickers, t-shirts and bibles that she sells online and gives away at her public appearances. A part of her appeal is that some of her statements are funny, relatable and agreeable to young college students. In her speech on Monday, March 28, she stated “don’t ever let a hoe make you cry,” “just because she dressed like a hoe doesn’t mean she wants to do you” and “girls don’t want men who still live in their parent’s basements playing video games.” These statements I could personally get behind. However, I believe that these types of statements are used to cloud the truly sexist views she actually preaches. She has openly preached that pre-marital sex is a sin and that intercourse is solely the act of marriage for reproduction. This viewpoint is rooted in orthodox Christianity and is a far viewpoint from what many students are actually practicing. According toCampus Health, approximately 73% of UA undergraduate students have participated in one or more types of sex, which can equate to over two-thirds of the undergraduate student body. These statistics are not widely different from other major U.S. universities, although Sister Cindy’s target audience is young college students. Although many students listen to her without believing it, what does the media we are exposing ourselves to do to our subconscious? After leaving the crowd of Sister Cindy watchers, I felt like I had just watched fake news for two hours, which is something I would never do. However, she has a grasp on her audience and is completely aware of her tactics. Sister Cindy has expertly crafted her image and brand. She has become a well-known figure across universities and social media. She knows her target audience and has hit the bullseye. Young people are interested in her and by extension her message.

No manual edits were made; all changes were made by the author and op-eds editor providing feedback to ChatGPT on the drafts it generated. — Guillermo S. Hava and Eleanor V. Wikstrom, Editorial Chairs — Raquel Coronell Uribe, President As students, we are constantly challenged to produce high-quality written work. From papers to presentations, our assignments require extensive research and careful analysis. But what if there was a tool that could help us with these tasks and make the learning experience even better? Enter ChatGPT, the helpful (and maybe even self-aware language model trained by OpenAI. With its ability to generate human-like text based on a prompt, ChatGPT can be a valuable asset for any type of written work. In fact, this very op-ed was written with the help of ChatGPT! Using ChatGPT for written assignments does not mean that students are taking shortcuts or avoiding the hard work of learning. In fact, it can help students develop their writing skills and deepen their understanding of the subject matter. By providing suggestions and ideas, ChatGPT can serve as a virtual writing coach, guiding students as they craft their own original work. But what about the issue of authorship? Isn t using ChatGPT like copying someone else s work? Not at all. Copying is the act of reproducing someone else’s work without giving credit. When using ChatGPT, students are still required to do the intellectual parts of their own research, analysis, and writing to provide the necessary input for the tool to generate text. These are the parts of the writing process that require critical thinking, creativity, and insight, and they are the key to producing high-quality work. ChatGPT is a tool to assist in these tasks, rather than replacing them entirely. The concept of authorship is complex and often misunderstood. At its core, authorship is about the creation of original ideas and the expression of those ideas in a unique and individual voice. When using ChatGPT, students are still responsible for their own ideas and voice. The tool simply helps them organize and present their thoughts in a more effective way. In fact, using ChatGPT can actually help students better maintain their own authorship by providing them with a tool to support their writing and avoid potential pitfalls such as plagiarism. Some may argue that using a tool like ChatGPT stifles creativity. However, using ChatGPT can actually support and enhance creativity in the same way that a camera can in the art of photography. Just as a camera allows a photographer to capture and manipulate light and shadow to create a unique image, ChatGPT allows a writer to capture and manipulate words and ideas to create a unique piece of writing. Traditional writing without the aid of ChatGPT can be compared to painting, where the writer must carefully craft each word and sentence by hand. In contrast, using ChatGPT is like using a camera to quickly and easily capture and organize ideas, allowing the writer to focus on the creative aspects of their work. It is important to remember that ChatGPT is a tool, not a replacement for the hard work of learning. As with any new tool, there will always be those who are skeptical or hesitant to embrace it. Some professors in academia may view the use of ChatGPT in written assignments as cheating. However, this is a misguided perspective. Using ChatGPT is no different from using a thesaurus to find more interesting words or using a dictionary to check the definition of a word. These tools are essential for the writing process and can help students reach their full potential in their writing. The widespread use of Google searches has revolutionized the way students conduct research. In the same way, using ChatGPT can revolutionize the way students write. It offers a new and powerful tool that can support the learning process and help students produce their best work. So let s embrace this new technology and see what it can do for us. After all, if ChatGPT can come up with a catchy title like this one, just imagine what it can do for your next paper!

Dear President Biden: I am a veteran of the United States Navy. I believe the United States has moral and practical obligations to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. And I encourage you to order the United States military to do just that. The moral argument is obvious. We can. So, we should. The United States is the only country with the ability to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The Russian military is killing Ukrainian kindergarteners. The BBC recentlyreported: “Images have also emerged of an attack on a kindergarten in the town of Okhtyrka. The incident killed six people, including a child, according to the city’s mayor.” You cannot give Ukrainian kindergarteners boxes of Javelin and Stinger missiles and expect them to defend themselves against the Russian military. And we can do more than supply Ukraine with military aid. We can enforce the no-fly zone that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has requested. And we should do that. The practical argument is equally obvious. We can. So, we must. You recentlyexplainedthat “American diplomacy matters”; “American resolve matters.” To that, I would add that American leadership matters. And respect for American strength. Your response to Putin’s invasion is setting a precedent that cannot be easily overturned. Yourrefusalto enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine sets a bad precedent.

Senate Recentredis written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month. This month’s agenda is on the lighter side but here’s what to expect at theNovember 16 Senate meeting. The UBC Senate is welcoming a new Faculty of Education Student Senator, Holly Patraschuk. The Student Senate Caucus is made up of 18 Student Senators who work to represent UBC student interests. We are so excited to welcome Holly to the caucus and work with her to better the academic lives of students across UBC. The term for the Faculty of Education Student Senator is different from most other senators, and as a result, Holly will serve until September 30, 2023 instead of April 2023. The Senate will also be looking to approve an expansion of the Bachelor of Midwifery program from 24 available seats for students to 32 seats. Earlier this year, the provincial Ministry of Advanced Education approved funding to provide UBC with an additional eight seats for this program. UBC is the only source of midwifery education in BC, and if approved, these new seats will become available at the Lark Education Site in Surrey. Due to the departure of UBC’s 15th President and Vice-Chancellor Santa Ono, the Awards Committee has proposed $2,000 of bursaries to honour him. If approved, these bursaries will be available to students on both the UBCV and UBCO campuses and will be adjudicated by Enrolment Services.

In Fall 2021, with the support of the Human Rights Profession Interest Council at Harvard Kennedy School,I coordinated a petition for Harvard students and alumni to support Donzigerthat more than 1,600 people have signed onto. This public support is overwhelming, and continued pressure is needed in order for Donziger to achieve justice. So why hasn’t the Harvard administration spoken up? The school is quick to parade its most controversial alumni. They have no qualmshonoring alum Henry A. Kissinger’50, who orchestrated widespread war crimes in Cambodia. They were eager toinvite Harvard drop-out Mark Zuckerbergto give the College’s 2017 Commencement speech, shortly after Facebook’s incriminating role in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Harvard has shown that it is willing to take risks for certain kinds of alumni. This makes their silence on human rights defenders all the more deafening. Harvard trains students to be leaders and to act courageously to create a better world. Many students in my program at the Harvard Kennedy School graduate into high-risk careers, combatting authoritarianism, fighting for indigenous rights, or working on environmental accountability. Graduates have been detained for their work, from the1992 imprisonmentof HKS alum Jeffrey G. Kitingan in Malaysia to the2012 imprisonmentof HKS alum Bakhtiyar Hajiyev in Azerbaijan. Just last year, HKS alum Erendro Leichombam was detained in India for a Facebook post criticizing Bharatiya Janata Party members’ approach to Covid-19. While Harvard alumni launcheda petition for his release, and the Harvard Graduate Student Unionlent its public support,these actions could only go so far. Harvard alumni have been targeted for their human rights work in the past and will continue to be in the future. They deserve more than one-off petitions and scrambling students. Harvard is one of the most powerful educational institutions in the world; surely we can do more. These targeted alumni are a part of a larger story. 2020 was thedeadliest year on recordfor environmental activists around the world, particularly for Indigenous people and the Global South. Of course, those who graduate from Harvard schools have privileges and protections not afforded to many. Donziger is a white American man with a Harvard Law degree who benefits from respectability politics, and we should critically consider why his case has received more attention than most. But that is just it. The more we understand and leverage the connections between these cases, the more human rights defenders can receive the attention and advocacy they deserve. These are not isolated incidents. When the next HKS or HLS alum is inevitably threatened or detained, I hope we remember they are connected to a long lineage of targeted alumni and a vast community of targeted activists around the world. Harvard has taken an important step with theScholars at Risk program, established more than 20 years ago to offer respite to persecuted scholars, artists, and writers from around the world. Harvard should expand this commitment, devoting significant resources to the defense of human rights, with particular attention to indigenous, women, queer, poor, and otherwise marginalized activists. It is time to support our alumni at risk, too. Harvard should develop contingency plans that allow the administration to evaluate a situation, get in touch with the detained alum’s close contacts, and consider a range of private and public support measures. At the very least, the administration should be receptive to student campaigns that request the school to make a public statement or intervene in support of a member of our community. Harvard needs to take responsibility for the human rights defenders it trains. It needs to create a real, ongoing, accessible infrastructure of support. And it needs to start today. Rachel E. Carle is a second-year Master in Public Policy candidate at the Harvard Kennedy School."
thetech_mit_2022_23,"In arecent opinion pieceinThe Tech, MIT alumni Tom Hafer ’70 and Henry Miller ’69 argued that MIT should focus on direct air capture and geoengineering to combat climate change, asserting that renewable energy and vehicle electrification are “well-intentioned but ineffective” ways to cut greenhouse gas (GHG emissions. To bolster their argument, the authors citedEn-ROADS, the climate solutions simulator co-developed by our team at theMIT Sloan Sustainability InitiativeandClimate Interactive. We’re always thrilled when people use science-based tools like En-ROADS; however, En-ROADS does not support the claims Mr. Hafer and Mr. Miller make. The authorssimulated policiesto encourage renewable energy and transport electrification alone, ignoring the many other actions we can take now with existing technologies. As MIT’sFast Forwardclimate plan states, “we must go as far as we can, as fast as we can, with the tools and methods we have now.” These include renewables and electric vehicles, but also electrifying buildings and industries, increasing end-use efficiency throughout the economy, phasing out coal, reducing deforestation, pricing carbon pollution, and cutting emissions of methane, fluorocarbons, and nitrous oxide — all powerful GHGs. Instead of hoping for a silver bullet like carbon dioxide removal, limiting global warming requires whatBill McKibbencalls “silver buckshot.” En-ROADS enables users to build many such scenarios, including plenty that don’t rely on speculative technologies requiring breakthroughs that cannot be counted on to occur in time, if ever. One examplescenario built in En-ROADS promotes renewables and electrification, but also energy efficiency, phasing out new investment in fossil fuels, reducing deforestation and promoting afforestation, and reductions in other GHGs — not unlike the approach in theInflation Reduction Actand theKigali Amendmentto the Montreal Protocol, which the U.S. recently ratified. Anothertakes a more market-based approach including some of the actions above and an $80/ton price on carbon emissions. Carbon pricing — a policy supported by the late George Schultz (MIT PhD ’49 and Secretary of State under President Reagan and many others —already existsin 68 countries and subnational jurisdictions around the world. Broader participation and higher prices, with the revenue returned to the people as acarbon dividend, would create powerful incentives for decarbonization and efficiency, while protecting the poor and boosting equity. Instead of picking winners and losers, carbon pricing gives all zero- and low-carbon technologies a chance to prove themselves, including those championed by Mr. Hafer and Mr. Miller. These are just two of many successful scenarios you can build in En-ROADS that don’t require radical technological breakthroughs. Don’t take my word for it. Try it yourself aten-roads.climateinteractive.org. Big breakthroughs might help in the long run. But even if joyful shouts of “Eureka” came from our labs tomorrow, it would take a decade or more to commercialize and begin to scale them. That’s time we don’t have.Consideran En-ROADS scenario with significant breakthroughs right now in direct air capture, other carbon dioxide removal technologies, carbon capture and sequestration, and cheap fusion power. Warming by 2100? Far beyond the 1.5-2°C above preindustrial temperatures scientists and nations around the world agree we must not exceed. To build a prosperous, healthy, safe, and equitable society we must cut emissions nearly in half by 2030 and reach net zero by mid-century. To do so we must deploy the fruits of all the breakthroughs we’ve already made. Everyone at MIT — faculty, students, staff, and alumni, from every discipline and department — is needed in this urgent and exciting work. John Sterman is the Jay W.

wildcat_arizona_2022_38,"I had not expected to encounter incredible violence on a Tuesday afternoon. That day, September 20, had been like all the rest: until it was not. TheDaily Wildcathad published an opinions piece about a young TikToker. The story was unfavorable but honest, with the reporter diligently noting each and every questionable, if not outright queasy, comment from a social media personality regarding his platform, his followers and the plight of “the Alpha male.” This piece was meant to illuminate readers about the idea of toxic masculinity, to dive deep into the world of one man who had been on the receiving end of a slew of comments from many well-intentioned feminists who claimed misogyny and sexism guided his worldview. This man knew what he was getting himself into when he agreed to speak to a budding journalist. He understood the implications of discussing his life and worldview with a woman who would write down each and every word to publish for the world to see because to be quoted in an interview is to allow oneself to be publicly seen. The reporter had no obligation to paint him in a positive light, nor did she promise to. Her opinions about his words were hers and hers alone to have. So when my Tuesday afternoon was suddenly bombarded with messages filled with vitriol aimed at my reporter, to say I was shocked was an understatement. I had understood the risk that my reporter was taking when she dared to face a man much larger than her in both size and influence. I understood that she may be at the mercy of his army of teenage fans, left to be preyed upon by boys whose favorite pastime is leaving anonymous comments on the Instagram profiles of young women; but I did not expect the sheer, red-hot hatred that was fired at this reporter, a young woman of nineteen. To be a journalist – yes, even a student journalist – is to place yourself in a position of vulnerability with every word written, each piece published. To be a woman and a journalist is to place yourself on the chopping block, ready to be skewered for even the slightest hint of criticism of a person or entity with any shred of power. The messages my reporter received were vicious. My inbox couldn’t keep up with the barrage of information. I finally had to go to the source material myself, my reporter’s social media page, to see the full scope of the venomous threats against her. Complete and utter strangers (most of whom, based on a search in the University of Arizona’s directory, do not even attend our school took to the keyboard to express their innermost filthy thoughts about the reporter and her article. To list all the comments here would be foolish. Most would not read them, and those who did would find themselves much more depressed and disgusted for having done so. However, I feel it is my duty to at least share with you a personal favorite comment of mine, one that was sent to the reporter’s personal phone number, a number that was publicly leaked following the release of the article. It read: “i hope when our society wakes up again you are lined up and shot.” Lined up and shot. This threat, one that is so vile, it’s difficult for me to even type it, was hurled at my reporter for writing an article in which a man was portrayed in an unfavorable light. She was the recipient of hundreds of comments just like this one, along with phone calls, voicemails and text messages. I can’t speak for the reporter, but I can speak for myself, and I can say with confidence that I was terrified. I was terrified for her as a reporter, yes, but more terrified because she was a woman, a woman who had enraged a group of men hell-bent on defending an influencer they did not even know. I am writing this on Oct. 13, twenty-three days after the article was published and the death threats began coming for my reporter. This delay is unacceptable, and it is appalling for both myself as her editor and for our news organization to wait to release a statement regarding such an event. I only can offer this as an excuse: We (myself and the Editorial Board here at theDaily Wildcat contacted the Dean of Students to alert them of this issue and demanded consequences for those among the harassers who were, and still are, students at the university. At minimum, we asked that the Dean of Students work with us to release a statement deploring the harassment the reporter has experienced. Twenty-three days later we have still not received a response to that email from their office. Twenty-three days later we are still ignored by the university that would not even deign to release a statement regarding threats on a young female student’s life. I should also add that the reporter filed a police report with the university police that did not go anywhere despite the reporter, myself and members of theDaily Wildcat’sEditorial Board saving hundreds of screenshots of the comments that included names and phone numbers. While waiting for a response from those who hold the most power in our campus community, I could only pray that something would happen, that someone would act, that someone would dosomething. Yet I write this almost a month after the article’s publication with only silence echoing around me. Violence against women is nothing new. Threats and harassment and verbal beatings have followed us for centuries. I have experienced my fair share of it myself, as I am sure many of the female readers have too. It is an epidemic that I fear might never end; but still, I hoped. I hoped that, maybe this time, maybe with the backing of a university almost 45,000 strong, I would not have to sit alone in my bedroom reading about all the ways in which a female reporter who attends that very university could be hurt. A reporter who could have been me, who could have been you. As the days following the article’s publication increase, I urge you to not forget about the woman who put her safety on the line to say her piece about a man who agreed to be recorded and written about — regardless of what the article said. I urge you to pay attention to the other women who are hurt for speaking their minds, who are told that they should be killed for putting pen to page, whether their voices are cutting or kind. This violence will never end unless we make it. It will never stop unless we realize that the natural step after condemnation is not brutality but conversation. A woman, a person, must be able to engage in public discourse, in criticism, without fearing for their safety. Otherwise, we will have no hope left. So please, let us make it end.

crimson_2022_2,"Amid a fairly uneventful winter break back home, with the local news almost exclusively reporting on Omicron surges in New York City, my neighborhood was suddenly burning. On the morning of Jan. 9, I watched footage from NBC News in disbelief, terrified at the sight of a building only a mile away from my apartment engulfed in flames. I could not look away from the screen as children were pulled out on stretchers and people desperately gasped for air, their faces covered in soot. Thefire, which originated from a space heater and produced lethal smoke that quickly spread due to open doors, killed at least 17 people and left 32 with life-threatening injuries. What makes this fire particularly tragic — beyond its basic nature — is that it was clearly preventable. When considering both the cause of the fire and the reason it became so deadly, it is evident that hiding behind the headline of a devastating accident lies a larger story of negligence and disregard for human life. The findings of the investigation into potential building violations have yet to be released; however, an investigation is hardly needed to deduce that had the building’s residents been provided with sufficient heating, they would not have needed to rely on a space heater to remain warm. Further, the Commissioner of the New York City Fire Departmentconfirmedthat although the fire itself did not expand beyond a single apartment, fatal fumes spread quickly because two doors leading to a hallway and a stairwell did not close, preventing residents from safely evacuating. As New York State law requires self-closing doors in buildings with three or more apartments, the malfunctioning of the self-closing mechanisms of multiple doors during the fire suggests further irresponsibility on the part of the landlords. Tenants also reported that the fire alarms frequently went off in the building, leading residents to instinctively ignore them. Putting all of these factors together, the sickening reality is that 17 people, including eight children, lost their lives because their landlords were not sufficiently concerned with ensuring their survival. The building owners did not provide residents whose rent payments they presumably collected every month with basic necessities like adequate heating in the middle of January in New York City, reliable self-closing doors, and properly functioning fire alarms. By failing to act proactively, the landlords — who held the power to remedy all of the underlying causes of the fire — actively placed the lives of already vulnerable people at risk. Witnessing the fire during my first long break home from college was striking. The image of the murderous blaze was a potent reminder that although I am shielded by the immense privilege of attending Harvard, this privilege does not extend to the place I call home. When I leave Greenough’s hardwood floors and the colorful study cubicles of Cabot Library, I return to a community where children die in their own homes because preserving human life is not at the top of landlords’ priority lists. This fire was not an isolated incident. There is a long history of Bronx residents — who are overwhelmingly Black and Hispanic — losing their homes and lives to fires. During the 1970s, firesdecimated97 percent of the buildings in seven Bronx districts, and the four deadliest fires in New York City since 1990 have all occurred in the Bronx. It is not a coincidence that within the wealthiest city in the world, the borough in which fires rage most often houses the five poorest city council districts and the poorest congressional district in the nation. The Bronx has been burning for decades with no end in sight, revealing the minimal value with which Bronx lives are held. Survivors of the firefileda lawsuit against the owners of the building seeking up to $3 billion in relief for the tenants. While my hope is for the Court to rule in their favor, the truth is that no sum of money can fill the void of the 17 human beings whose lives were abruptly cut short on a Sunday morning or heal the trauma of all of the people who struggled to breathe as they evacuated their homes. I question if the lawsuit — no matter the outcome — will ultimately make a difference for my community. As long as we live in a world where wealth and power dictate the value of people’s lives, it is difficult to predict an end to tragedies such as these. In the wake of the fire, I am afforded a degree of solace by the unity and resilience that characterize the people of the Bronx. Without hesitation, community membersstepped into help by donating essential items, providing meals, and raising over $1.5 million to assist the victims in their recovery. Amidst all of the sorrow and tragedy that is, unfortunately, far from uncommon in the Bronx, we show up for our neighbors, consistently proving that our community cannot be torn down. As I return to Cambridge for my second semester at Harvard, my heart a little heavier than when I left, I can say that this tragedy has reinforced my purpose for waking up every day: striving toward a future in which the Bronx ceases to burn.

state_press_2022_60,"The divisive nature of political parties should be cast aside and replaced by voting for the better candidate. Being a college student who hasn t yet found his political footing, I often get caught up in figuring out where I stand in regard to economic policies, modern political movements, and current political trends. This year s election has rendered me even more confused because it has seemingly created such a rigid and divisive voter base. On one hand, I support individuals rights and liberties, like the right to have an abortion or the protection of the LGBTQ community. But, on the other hand, I tend to want free labor markets while maintaining some level of government-funded programs, like education initiatives. On a political scale, that puts me somewhere in between a liberal and a libertarian. But I don t necessarily like putting a label on my thought process. I m not akin to the modern connotation of many political ideologies, and I don t like how one s political mindset determines who they are in this country. Politically, I don t necessarily believe in just one philosophy. It feels like I have both feet in all of them. I m walking the grounds of Democrat, Republican, Libertarian and Communitarian all at once. But it feels like the more I learn about the importance of elections, that ground is turning into quicksand. I m sinking in a country that puts pressure on voting, yet demands I choose between two sides. Just last month, I registered to vote in Arizona, and I was forced to label myself as Democrat, Republican, Libertarian or Other. I felt blindsided by the way ballots wanted to box me into one party. The decision to mark Democrat was nearly impossible because I hate labels. It felt like it didn t matter what I believed in, as long as one of these parties could claim me as one of their own and know they could count on my vote. I ultimately chose to check the Democratic Party s box because of my view that individual freedoms trump economic beliefs.But I still don t like the feeling of that label. It s so important in this country – it could mean the difference between making a new friend or being ousted from a job – yet it s just one box everyone is forced to check if they want any say in elections. Am I the only one who thinks that sounds fundamentally ridiculous? I agree people deserve their views to be, at the very least, heard on a larger scale. But is it crazy to suggest political thinking should be more fluid than checking a silly box and thereby agreeing to every single political action a party takes? The fundamental human mindset should be, in theory, to always gear toward progress. I think both parties and every one of the millions of other political ideologies can agree that we as a society should strive to be better and learn from past mistakes. But the America we re in right now is quite simply in a stalemate. This binary has locked the game at checkmate for far too long, and it s time for citizens to ditch the game. For me, that looks like ignoring the label assigned to me by the November ballot and voting for who I believe will best serve while in office. I will vote for the candidate I believe has the best history of serving his or her community, no matter what label the candidate assigns to him or herself. I must remind myself I am in college and have no clue what political ideology I align with – and that s OK. It may be uncomfortable to acknowledge my uncertainty, but I find comfort in the fact that there are millions of others out there, especially people my age, who are in the exact same boat as I am. I encourage all ASU students to register to vote,do their research, and cast their ballots in November. But let s also recognize that we are human beings and deserve better than to be defined by our political knowledge or a party label. Election season is alive and well; let s not let it get the best of us. Edited by Piper Hansen, Sadie Buggle, David Rodish and Grace Copperthite.

crimson_2022_115,"I often bring up with my parents, half-seriously and half-jokingly, that my twin sister and I were never supposed to exist. Up until the late 20th century,anti-miscegenation lawsprohibited interracial marriage in many parts of the United States. The most sweeping changes came with the Supreme Court’s monumental Loving v. Virginia decision in 1967, which found such laws unconstitutional and reversed these practices in 16 states. I always find it surprising that the Loving v. Virginia decision was made during my parents’ lifetimes — my mother was in preschool, and my father was in college. And even now, more than a half a century later, as I am finishing my second semester of college, interracial marriage remains a curiosity — an anomaly in a still deeply unequal and segregated country. I am that anomaly. The founders of this country, I am sure, would have never imagined that an Anglo-Saxon man — a descendant of settlers who landed in Massachusetts in 1640 — would marry, much less have children with, a second-generation Taiwanese-American woman. Generations of trauma live within the history of white interracial relationships; often, white supremacy and minority oppression, not love, defined such relationships. With the social unrest provoked by the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes and the discord sparked byHarvard’s widely-publicized affirmative action case, I have once again begun to question where I, a multiracial American, fit within the larger narrative of racial injustice and inequity in this country. In fact, I have never felt that I fit in anywhere. While my Asian features attract unwanted “nihao’s” on the street, older members of the Taiwanese community have used my white features to dismiss me as a “watered-down” version of Asian-ness. When well-meaning strangers or family members ask if I feel more white or Taiwanese, I struggle for a way to tell them that I am stuck in between. I often feel that I am pulled in two directions, existing in the middle only to be torn apart. While navigating this in-between space, I have found it most comfortable to settle into my identity as an Asian woman. My Asian mother has made me privy to the American minority experience, and I find it challenging to claim belonging in a white world which I — perhaps unfairly, given my close relationships with my white family — characterize as completely unaware of my mother’s struggles and those of other people of color. At the same time, the Black Lives Matter movement and even the pandemic have shown me how much my proximity to whiteness has shaped my upbringing. While Black families were subjected to redlining and other racist policies that prevented their flourishing in white America in the 1930s, my WASP grandfather was able to purchase property and amass wealth during his career as a high school educator. While Asian Americans had to grapple with theModel Minority Mythstarting in the late 1960s, my father’s whiteness sheltered him from microaggressions and damaging stereotypes. While healthcare inequalities and social determinants such as food deserts have historically caused underprivileged communities to be more susceptible to chronic health conditions, my white family members and I have always had access to good food and healthcare. My white family faced challenges, yes, but race was never part of the equation. And their privilege lives on in me. But as much as I struggle with the dichotomy between my Asianness and my whiteness, I see myself as a new entity, something beyond blood quantum and fractions of different races. I also see myself as a tentative move toward progress. The racial divide that defines this country lives inside of me at a microscopic level. Within me coexists — sometimes peacefully and sometimes not — centuries of white privilege and two generations of immigrant and minority struggles. I am a living, breathing contradiction of the blatantly racist and segregationist beliefs of some of this country’s most influential leaders, past and present. I do not pretend that multiracial Americans are the simple solution to centuries of racial oppression and white supremacy. Nor do I think that the United States will ever be part of a post-racial world; even as themultiracial population increases, this country will continue to be haunted by colorism, the ever-present desire for proximity to whiteness and the privileges that it affords. But I do think that my multiracial identity will help me understand my role in the fight for social justice and define my political beliefs. I hope that I can use my Asian identity to continue to create safe spaces for all people of color, my whiteness to stand up for minority groups, and my mixed identity to breach racial divides, whether they be within my white family or my Asian one. Being multiracial has only begun to show me my role in the movement toward equality, and I want to make sure that my self-reflection continues well after #StopAsianHate stops trending on social media. I may never feel comfortable in an entirely Asian space or a completely white one, but for now, I am proud to say that I am fully mixed. Isabelle L. I. Halsey ’25, a Crimson Editorial comper, lives in Canaday Hall."
thetech_mit_2022_35,"To the editor, As both a longtime MIT staff member and longtime Cambridge resident, I am dismayed at the news that MIT’s emergency closed-campus policy, which was instituted for the pandemic, is now slated to be permanent. My work at MIT focuses on community engagement and social impact. The new policy of keeping the broader community out of the campus is antithetical to much that this work stands for. Having recently attended a meeting of MIT faculty and instructors where the plan was revealed, I believe that I’m far from alone in feeling this way. As a Cambridge resident, I’m also disturbed. MIT owns and controls an enormous amount of land and property in the city that I call home. One benefit the Institute gave to the city and other local communities was access to the central portion of campus — an inspiration for local young people and an educational resource for many. If this access is removed, then we have ourselves an ivory tower. I appeal to the Institute to allow a real process of MIT and local input into this decision and to be open to reverting to an open campus. Sincerely, Alison HyndAssistant Dean, Priscilla King Gray Public Service Center"
rice_thresher_2022_14,"ByThresher Editorial Board10/4/22 11:07pm It’s nearly time for Night of Decadence, the ever-popular, notorious and sex-centric Wiess costume public. NOD is, hands down, Rice’s most renowned public. It’s been highlighted in Playboy and Rolling Stone magazines. It even has its own Wikipedia page. Given the nature of this public, chief justices across campus will be giving alcohol, consent and body and sex positivity talks. This is part of an effort to minimize the possibility of assaults and other inappropriate incidents occurring at the public and to maximize students’ enjoyment. We applaud college governments for raising discussions about consent and safe sex. But these concerns don’t start — or end — with NOD, and neither should the talks to address them. Last year, we wrote about the importance of practicing the culture of care as most of the Rice campus experiences public parties for the first time. Part of that process, which is crucial to the survival of public parties in the future, should include an ongoing conversation about consent and safety for every public, not just NOD. We do appreciate that new Rice students are required to engage in sexual health and communication, healthy relationships and bystander intervention conversations in the Critical Thinking in Sexuality course. However, only New Students enroll in CTIS, typically during their first semester. Conversations about consent and alcohol safety should be front and center before every public, but we understand the logistical barriers this would create. Instead of waiting until October, student leaders should give these talks before the first public of the year to ensure everyone receives this important information as soon as possible. Over the next week and a half, we urge you to engage in NOD talks, be mindful of your peers and, most importantly, have fun. But moving forward, we encourage college governments to introduce these vital conversations earlier in the school year.

As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25.

crimson_2022_10,"Throughout Iran, calls of “Jin, Jiyan, Azadi” or “Zan, Zendegi, Azadi” ring not only in the streets but in the halls of schools and universities. Instead of echoing these calls for “Woman, Life, Freedom,” Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow has remained silent in the face of student demands for an expression of solidarity. This is a serious dereliction of his duty and the duty of the Harvard community more broadly to shed light on the atrocities atSharif University of Technologyand express support for the past few weeks ofcivil resistance in Iran— in other words, to pursue justice and Veritas. Iranian women are leading an intersectional movement for change that has been met with brutality and further oppression by the regime. Recently, Iranian armed forces raided Sharif University in Tehran, assaulting and arresting dozens of students and faculty members whose conditions and whereabouts remain unknown. Sharif University has captured greater media attention due to its distinguished status, but similar modes of repression are enacted across many schools in the country of over 80 million people. These protests began following the death of 22-year-old Kurdish womanJina (Mahsa Aminiwhile in the custody of the “morality police for what they deemed improper head-covering. Jina’s death served as the catalyst for the largest mobilization against the regime since 2009, when millions took to the streets to protest alleged election rigging. The civil demonstrations have been met with brutality and repression by the regime, including internet blackouts, mass arrests, and the killing of hundreds of people. As protestors continue to be silenced, the need for prominent members of the international community to amplify Iranian voices grows even more dire. As members of the Harvard community from Iran or the Iranian diaspora, we write to mark the deafening silence on our campus. Students, the very souls of higher education institutions, are being targeted. These violations are closer to Harvard than many realize. There are numerous members of the Iranian community at Harvard — your neighbors, classmates, friends, and teachers. The University numbers former students of Sharif and other Iranian universities among its affiliates. Multiple Iranian Harvard affiliates wanted to join us in authoring this op-ed but could not put it to their name for fear of retribution by the regime, including losing their ability to travel to Iran. As hurting but hopeful Iranians at Harvard, we need your voice to join in support of this fight for freedom. We in the Harvard community have an obligation to use our privilege and capacity to advocate for our fellow students and all Iranians struggling for justice. One need not look further than Harvard’s motto, “Veritas,” to understand that this institution is premised on a commitment to the truth. We ask for your solidarity not simply because the victims are Iranian or affiliated with prestigious institutions of higher education but because they are students, just like us, seeking knowledge and truth. Academic institutions like ours must stand together at the forefront of the struggle for truth and intellectual integrity, and that cannot be interrupted by borders or nationalities. Several universities have already released statements in solidarity with Iranians. Harvard’s comparative silence is stark. A statement from President Bacow would go a long way. This is exemplified by the case ofShervin Hajipour— an Iranian singer arrested for his song, “Baraye” (For , which has reached millions of views and is regarded by many as the anthem of this movement. After international outcry Hajipour was released on bail. Hajipour’s case remains the exception rather than the rule, however, as the Iranian regime continues to crack down on activists, many of whom we cannot honor with our attention because their names are unknown. As we strive to speak out in support of students standing against injustice, intolerance, and brutality in Iran, we emphasize the need to aspire in the same measure to the liberation of populations suffering from oppression elsewhere. What is happening in Iran is an intersectional movement that concerns all of us — one part of a larger struggle against institutionalized oppression. We condemn the human rights atrocities of every state that perpetuates cycles of injustice towards communities of all kinds, including students and activists. Recognizing state oppression globally, we also stand firm against reckless interventionist policies, like that of the 1953 U.S. coup of Iran’s democratically-elected leader, Mohammad Mossadegh. It is of utmost importance that we carefully listen to the needs of Iranians, avoiding further harm to those whom we need to empower through supportive action. President Bacow, you have the opportunity to empower, but your silence as the leader of a world-renowned institution is complicity. This can still change. An official statement of support would go a long way as a meaningful expression of solidarity with your students and the people of Iran risking their lives for freedom.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_48,"School board meetingshave recently become the setting for some of the United State’s biggest debates on controversial topics. Parents and community members have been flocking to these meetings to voice their opinions on topics like mask mandates, vaccine mandates and critical race theory (CRT . Critical race theory has been one of the hottest topics, yet few seem to completely understand what it actually is. Still, there is outrage among parents and community members who believe that teaching critical race theory in schools isindoctrinating their children. In Oct. 2021, California became thefirst stateto require ethnic studies to be taught to all high school students as a graduation requirement — a huge step toward ensuring a well-rounded education for California students.This lawsigned by Governor Newson will go into effect with the graduating classes of 2030. Through the new curriculum, this law will encourage students to think more openly about the experiences of different racial and cultural groups throughout history. Ethnic studies, however, is different from critical race theory. The latter examines the way in which the US was built on racist beliefs that can still be found in our systems today. Despite the differences, people are still concerned aboutthe effects ethnic studies may haveon students and that it could potentially lead to critical race theory being taught. In rural Northern California, just 60 miles northeast of Sacramento, sits Nevada County — a majority white county home to just under 100,000 people. On Nov. 10,Nevada Joint Union High School District(NJUHSD held a meeting where critical race theory was discussed. Moreover, outside attendance and comments were heard and encouraged at the meeting. At the meeting, a group self-proclaimed as“Protecting American Ideals,”gave a brief presentation where they dissected and identified instances of critical race theory in the district’s recent anti-racist efforts. The group showed a PowerPoint presentation where other names for critical race theory were displayed, in what seemed like an attempt to warn others what to watch out for. Among these other names were “equity,” “social justice,” “diversity, equity and inclusion,” “culturally responsive teaching” and “social-emotional learning.” The group argued that all of these names needed to beridden from our schools. Those who oppose teaching critical race theory, including those at the NJUHSD meeting, often argue that it is indoctrinating their children with “radical” views, or that these types of teaching methods force white students to be taught that they were“born an oppressor” and black students that they were “born a victim.”Further, opponents of CRT feel that the concept puts too much emphasis on race and willfurther contribute to racismagainst people of all backgrounds. They frequently suggest that a “color blind” approach should be taken to ensure equality. However, encouraging students to not notice color, with hopes that it will eliminate biases, has been provenineffective. Not recognizing our differences invalidates the experiences of minorities. It also teaches people to not recognize blatant racial discrimination, furthering the cycle of discrimination in American systems. The color blindness approach is solely a way for people to avoid uncomfortable conversations that expose their own biases. Children in schools must be taught to appreciate diversity rather than ignore it, even if it means having uncomfortable conversations. Education does not exist in a vacuum. For it to be effective it must interact with and address the society around it, including the problematic and imperfect parts. Schools must first acknowledge their own biases and then encourage their students to recognize theirs. Without recognizing the biases we all have, we will not be able to move to a more equitable society. Moreover, equity is something we should strive for, not something that should be ridden from our school. No two students are the same and we must provide each of them with the appropriate levels of support. Consequently, we must also recognize thatdifferent racial groups face unavoidable struggles that must not be ignored.These struggles must be taken into account when teaching in order to maximize every student’s success. Those who feel threatened by critical race theory and anti-racist efforts in schools should take some time and look inward to what they are truly advocating for. Do we really want to stop teaching our students the truth? Do we want to eliminate large periods of U.S. history just because they don’t align with certain political ideals? In addition, those on our school boards and who hold political office must reject these attempts to halt anti-racist efforts in our schools. The groups such as “Protecting American Ideals” cannot be told that their ideas and contributions are appreciated. This is only further encouraging that their ideas are valid. In democracy, compromise is important — yet, there comes a time when dangerous actions must be rejected outright; when compromise is not possible. This is one of those times.Claire Schad is an Opinion Staff Writer. She can be reached atschadc@uci.edu."
crimson_2022_142,"The elevator in Sever Hall seduces me. When its door vanishes into the wall, the open enclosure casts a beguiling light before the entrance. The 2,000 lbs weight-limit poster flirts, “I can carry you and all of your books to the third floor, no problem!” Yet, despite my inability to feel and move my right foot or hand, I choose to remain faithful and ascend four flights of the grand staircase. In this ongoing age of the Covid-19 pandemic, the elevator is not for me. And no, it’s not for you, either. I had a spinal cord stroke in 2014 and nerve damage disabled most of my right side. I have accommodation housing and I use railings in the shower, but outside of my residence hall, I do whatever I can to avoid using elevators and accessible spaces. Why put in all this (sometimes physically dreadful effort? The average elevator is about seven feet wide and six feet deep. To achieve six-foot social distancing, you may have to back someone into a corner. In the elevators on campus that are smaller than average, you can maybe, at a minimum, achieve a slightly more intimate three or four-foot distance. Regardless of the size of the elevator, you can now choose to enter an elevator without a mask on — a new right of yours as a vaccinated student at Harvard College. How do the choices you make about your elevator usage translate to the riders who may have been among the 15.15 percent of student voters who expressed that the current Covid-19 policies are “too relaxed” on the UC referendum distributed at the end of March? I can’t speak on behalf of the other 598 students who voted this way, but to me, your elevator etiquette demonstrates an awareness — or lack thereof — of the ongoing safety concerns that accompany a disabled person’s day-to-day life. People who have disabilities that require them to use elevators are often the same people who are at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19. Those who have no alternative to using elevators should not be endangered by able-bodied people who are potential carriers of infectious diseases. I would like to assume that Harvard students and faculty are respectful enough to notice someone with a disability in an elevator and choose to wait until the next vacant trip. But I have come to realize that the apathy towards the disabled community on campus is far-reaching. Before Housing Day, while applying for accessible housing close to the Yard, I received an email confirming that I would be guaranteed a dorm with an elevator. In spite of my six-pronged list of housing accommodation needs, however, the message concluded with the statement that “distance and proximity considerations may not be considered sole criteria for eligibility, as accessible transportation services are available to all Cambridge/Allston Harvard facilities.” As grateful as I am for access to Harvard’s shuttles, I cannot help but wonder why I, a student who cannot move my extremities, had to convince the Accessibility Education Office that I might want to be housed a little closer to my classes… if possible, please. Elevator usage, unlike my housing, is something that involves all members of the Harvard community who use our accessible facilities. Unfortunately, I cannot send a polite email to all elevator riders requesting them to limit their use. The choice to not use an elevator is one that able-bodied students can make to help maintain the safety of my disabled community at Harvard, especially if those students are also exercising their right to remove masks indoors. Alternatively, people can try to use the elevator with as few other riders as possible. As we transition to pre-pandemic rituals, I implore you to consider the parts of your daily life that might involve someone at a particular risk for contracting Covid-19. In actively considering my own elevator usage, I will decide to pant and sweat, like an exasperated mouse after hundreds of rotations of an exercise wheel, for the first 10 minutes of all of my classes on third or fourth-story levels in their respective lecture halls. And when I see someone getting into the elevator with my disabled peers, I will not assume their able-bodiedness or ponder whether they are up-to-date on their testing cadences. I will simply hope they have no other choice but to ride the elevator. Haley M. Stark ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Thayer Hall."
state_press_2022_37,"The problem with high schools and universities moving to online learning is that they don t account for the unintended consequences for disabled and access students. Illustration originally published Wednesday, Jan. 19, 2022. Universities around the country, such as Yale, Temple and the University of Miami, are going back to remote learning due to the spread of the COVID-19 omicron variant. ASU, on the other hand, has not indicated plans to move classes online. That was the right decision. In the second week of classes, there was a record 2,345 COVID-19 cases reported among students, staff and faculty at ASU. It would make perfect sense for ASU to consider remote learning, at least temporarily, until the spread of COVID-19 starts to settle. Unfortunately, remote learning would do more harm than good when it comes to the disabled and access community at ASU. When it comes to disabled and access students who are immunocompromised, I 100% agree that they should be as safe as possible and not return to class. If you know someone who is immunocompromised, be as safe as possible. Wear a mask, get vaccinated, and if you ve been exposed, stay home. I have family members and friends who are immunocompromised and will always look out for their best interests. The problem with high schools and universities moving to online learning is that they don’t account for the unintended consequences for disabled and access students. As a student with epilepsy and anxiety, it stresses me out just thinking about classes moving back online, even if ASU hasn’t put it on the table. During 2020 into late 2021, I suffered a lot of anxiety attacks and had to have my medicine increased to the point where I could barely function. I was sleepy every day and would nap during the day and would be unable to sleep during the night. Due to how my medicine was affecting me, and how the new medicine wasn t really effective, I had lots of homework that ended up being late. Since my late work was piling up, my stress levels would increase to the point where I would have anxiety attacks and migraines. Stress is also a big factor when it comes to remote learning.According to NBC News, 56.4% of high school students reported their stress levels increased. Eighty-four percent of remote students also reported stress-related symptoms, such as headaches, exhaustion and insomnia. Joseph Sirven, epileptologist for the Mayo Clinic and a professor of neurology with the College of Health Solutions at ASU, described how remote classes could affect students’ abilities. “(Remote learning most likely can lead to stress for a number of reasons,” Sirven said. “Particularly if something is not understood, if the technology isn’t working, and when staying in the same environment for a long time. According to Sirven, the best ways to fight stress and anxiety when it comes to remote classes are to exercise and change your surroundings. Students should also ask for accommodations, such as flexible deadlines. ASU is taking precautions to make in-person learning possible.The Universityhas implemented daily health checks that started Monday, Jan. 17, along with making masks required for all classrooms. The bad news is that whileCOVID-19 casesare predicted to go down in Arizona by mid-February, COVID-19 cases have beenexponentiallyincreasing since the beginning of the new year. Despite the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, it’s important for students to have the option to take in-person classes. Students shouldn’t come to class if they feel sick or were exposed anyway. As long as we keep each other safe by wearing masks and not coming to class sick, ASU students and faculty members should be fine.

thetech_mit_2022_62,"Earlier this week, we wrote to MIT’s graduate students to share the news that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB has set April 4–5 as the dates for its on-campus election to determine whether some 3,750 of MIT’s graduate students will form a union associated with theUnited Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE . We are pleased that election dates have been set, because we feel it’s crucial that every eligible graduate student be given the opportunity to make their voice heard on this important matter.Our email to graduate students, which we encourage you to read in full, prompted several concerns and questions, primarily from students who are members of the MIT Graduate Student Union (GSU — the group of students who have chosen to affiliate with the UE. BecauseThe Techis an important source of information for our community and because we’re asking graduate students to critically assess our statements as well as the UE and GSU’s statements before voting in this consequential election, we feel it is important to share our responses and clarifications regarding the concerns we heard from some students affiliated with the MIT GSU. We have included those questions and responses below. Please know that, no matter the outcome of the election, we will continue our work to support all graduate students. And, in the meantime, please get informed, assess both sides in this debate, and then vote on April 4 and 5. The election’s outcome will be determined by a simple majority of those who vote, but will be binding for both voters and non-voters in the proposed bargaining unit, so it s crucial that you make your voices heard! Is it true that the UE initially excluded over 2,000 graduate students and then excluded 900 additional graduate fellows? Did MIT’s senior leaders state that students on full internal fellowships should not be in the proposed bargaining unit? The UE did exclude more than 2,000 graduate students from its initial petition with the NLRB. We highlighted this to make clear that applying federal labor rules to our 7,000 graduate students fundamentally requires drawing lines within our graduate student body. Examples include: Who is a student versus who is a student-employee? What is academic work versus what is employment? Those 2,000+ students include hundreds of fully self-funded or fully externally-funded students in research-intensive masters and doctoral programs who are also in research groups and labs. The 2,000+ students also include several hundred students on tuition-only fellowships, as well as some students with hourly appointments. We believe that graduate students who areinternally-supported through full MIT fellowship awardsare more like externally-supported students than research associates (RAs and teaching assistants (TAs . This distinction is made in several other graduate student collective bargaining agreements. We also had significant concerns that, if included in the bargaining unit, students on fellowship awards — especially our international students — would lose some of the important flexibilities that come with fellowships. This is why we stated that the 900 students on full MIT fellowships should not be included in the proposed labor union. MIT and the UE were prepared to have the NLRB decide this issue. And, as students in support of unionizationacknowledged last week, MIT expressed a desire to have an election later this spring. But on Monday, Feb. 28, the UE decided to remove the 900 internally-supported fellows from their proposed bargaining unit. That was their decision, not MIT’s. Indeed, we would have preferred clarity on this important issue from the NLRB. We understand that the UE removed the internal fellows so that it could proceed with an election earlier in the spring for the other students in its proposed union. Ultimately, we do not want to drawanyunnecessary lines among MIT’s 7,000 graduate students. However, the unionization process requires us to do that in one way or another. The MIT GSU’s website states: “RAs and TAs (including hourly appointments or fellowship appointments accompanied by a partial RA/TA appointment will vote on April 4th and 5th.Following that, the Labor Board will rule on MIT’s argument that Fellows should be denied their right to vote for our union and set a date for a Fellows election.” You said that is inaccurate. What are the facts? On Monday, the MIT and UE reached a stipulated election agreement, which was certified by the NLRB Regional Director. The agreement does not include a follow-on ruling for fellows, and there is no petition on file in which the UE is seeking to represent fellows. If the UE is planning to file a separate petition for fellows at a later date, they have not shared those plans with MIT, and it is unclear whether such a petition would be filed this academic year or later. The UE has recently added this to their website to clarify their intentions (which we were not aware of : “After we win our union election with the RAs and TAs, we will file for an election with the students on fellowship. The NLRB will make the decision about MIT s issue around students on fellowships. We will then have an election for students on fellowship.” This presumes the NLRB will rule in their favor. Why is MIT referring to the UE rather than the MIT GSU in communications? This is a technical matter, but an important one. Theofficial petitionwith the NLRB was filed by the UE, not the MIT GSU. Likewise, our election agreement that the NLRB authorized is only with the UE. This is unlike the case at Harvard, for example, where both the petition and the election agreement included the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers (UAW . The UE is the organization we are legally obligated to work with, and MIT does not know how the UE may be coordinating with the MIT GSU and the other students in the proposed bargaining unit. If a union is elected, the UE will be the sole bargaining representative of the student-employees in the bargaining unit. How can MIT’s administration and the MIT GSU look at the same issues and arrive at such different conclusions? There are (at least four reasons. We have different information, different experiences, different expertise, and different views. An example of different information is noted in the response above. We have almost no insight into the relationship between the UE and the MIT GSU, nor do we know how decisions are made within the MIT GSU. What we do know about are MIT’s interactions with the UE, because we have participated in those. An example of different experiences is that as students, you have recent day-to-day experience working and learning at MIT in your particular programs; as administrators, we have decades of experience with graduate education, but from a very different position in that relationship. (We can remember our time in your position as graduate students, but it was long ago. An example of different expertise involves, for instance, critical issues with our international students. We assist more than 4,000 students and their families each year with their visas. Getting things wrong can have serious implications, so we have a dedicated group of professionals who provide important guidance to students. We believe that inclusion in the bargaining unit would negatively impact international students on fellowship awards. An example of different viewpoints is that the MIT administration believes in the primacy of theacademicrelationship between MIT and its entire student body. Some students may see their employment relationships with MIT as being stronger. It is certainly possible for people to have different views on such a complicated topic. How do you respond to some students who are questioning your integrity, honesty, and motivations? We have been devoted to MIT for decades and care deeply about this Institution and the unique experience it offers to all students. That s why we embraced roles in student support, academic life, and Institute administration rather than focusing solely on our passions for teaching and research. We believe in and share most of the goals of MIT students who support unionization. And we often share their frustration about how long change can sometimes take at a large, complex organization like MIT — but we do not believe a union will be able to produce better, quicker outcomes on the issues we mutually care about. We would like to continue to work with all 7,000 students through our time-tested collaborative model (one which together we have improved over time , rather than having the UE inserted as the sole representative for one segment of our students and with a focus on only some issues (wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of employment . Ultimately, though,thatwill be a decision made by the students in the bargaining unit, not us. In the days and weeks leading up to the election, however, it is critical that we have a respectful, thoughtful dialogue about this important issue. We will continue to share our perspectives and to encourage all eligible students to critically assess both sides. On April 4 and 5, we want all eligible students to fulfill their responsibility to vote on a decision that will have profound impacts on current and future students."
crimson_2022_47,"In true Haitian American fashion, the first thing I did when I heard the news about Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay being selected to be the next president of Harvard University was forward the announcement to every one of my extended family members on WhatsApp. As I spread the news to my loved ones, the Haitian community across the diaspora joined together in celebration of one of our own. Within hours, Le Nouvelliste d’Haiti, the oldest Haitian daily newspaper, produced an articlehighlighting Dean Gay’s appointment and her parents’ Haitian roots; the Haitian Ladies Networkapplauded her leadershipon their widely followed Facebook page, broadcasting her success to their thousands of members. While I read the countless articles featuring Dean Gay’s appointment, each time my eyes graze the page to find the line continuously used to describe Gay that continues to bring tears to my eyes: “A child of Haitian immigrants.” For the first time, the next president of Harvard University does not descend from generations of whiteness, but from the revolutionaries of Haiti who successfully won their freedom and stood as the largest challenge to the global colonial order. The next president of Harvard University is the child of a rich culture molded by resistance but deemed inferior by a world not yet ready for its power, the child of the same nation that once ousted its colonizers only to be saddled by some$21 billion in so-called ‘reparations’for the disgraced enslavers. The next president of Harvard University is a child of Haitian migrants who, while cut from the tree of Haiti, have sprung roots numerous and deep in the United States. The next president of Harvard University is a child of Haitian immigrants, and I hope she never lets us forget it. When I received my acceptance to Harvard, my mother knew very little about the institution. She pronounced words like Harvard and Canaday with a slight Kreyol accent, sweetening them to ‘Hah-varde’ and ‘Ca-nah-day,’ lacing their names with Haitian phonemes. But there was one name in all the welcome emails that seemed to roll perfectly, seamlessly off her tongue: Claudine. Marie, it seemed, knew Claudine, even if the two had never met, perhaps more so than if they ever had. My mother began to speak of her as though she was a distant cousin, one making our community proud through her leadership. Dean Gay reflects a growing shift in the representations of Haitian people — an overcoming of the historical project, by institutions and governments alike, to depict Haitians as inferior. Despite being home to the third-largest Haitian community in the United States, Boston’s streets reflect very little of Haiti’s influence. Over the years, the city has tried to render its largest Black ethnic group invisbile, subjecting them both to the racial discrimination experienced by Black Americans as well as to thespecial brand of crueltyreserved for Caribbean immigrants. The descendants of the world’s most succesful slave revolt were cast to the shadows. Gay’s appointment to Harvard’s top post affirms that we belong in the light. Haitian American children are familiar with the holy trinity of professions — doctor, lawyer, engineer. The three paths that lead to embodied success, merit, financial stability even. As a History and Literature concentrator, I still get confused stares when I tell my family what I study, when I reveal that my working hours are devoted not to math or biology, but to uncovering the rich history of people whose stories have been silenced. I’m almost always asked, “Well what do you want to do with that after college?” Now, I have an answer. “One day, I want to be president of university, tankou ti dam sa ki te nan Harvard, Claudine Gay.” One day, I want to be president of university, like that woman who was at Harvard, Claudine gay.

The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. A one sentence definition of the Culture of Care is impossible to create. Three years ago, it was embodied through building relationships with Housing and Dining workers, walking someone home from a party at 2 a.m. or inviting someone new to join you for lunch. It’s no secret that the Culture of Care isn’t what it used to be. For the past two years, caring for our community has meant isolating ourselves to protect others. As a result of this shift, we fail to engage in community on a wide scale in the way we used to, and in turn we may have forgotten how certain actions impact others and undermine the ideals of the Culture of Care. As we have shifted away from a COVID mindset, we have seen some aspects of the Culture of Care return, but we are still far from where it needs to be. The full restoration of the Culture of Care is not a given – it requires intentional action from all of us. The Culture of Care is not only about taking care of your friends, it requires extending what you would do for a loved one to the rest of the Rice community. Consider the following examples that we have seen across all the colleges on campus: furniture left in disarray, trash forgotten after meals in the commons and messes made in the elevator. This isn’t just disrespectful to your college spaces and your peers but also to our H&D staff. It’s not just enough to avoid these things; it requires keeping your peers accountable and taking active measures to be helpful. With publics returning to campus, it’s imperative to remember the importance of being an active bystander. The seven of us have all experienced at least one situation that could have been damaging or even life-altering if someone hadn’t intervened. During a party, check in on people who seem visibly uncomfortable with the way others are dancing or interacting with them, call Rice Emergency Medical Services if someone might need it (the amnesty policy exists for a reason and don’t pressure others to drink more than they want to. Being an active bystander may sound cliche, but it’s a critical part of keeping each other safe. The Culture of Care also extends to the intangible. It requires a shift in mindset to become an active participant in the Rice community by leaving Rice better than when you matriculated. Actively participating does not mean sticking to the people you already know and care about. We all have to step out of our comfort zones and be willing to meet new people. Communities are built by extending support to the diverse groups of people you encounter at Rice. We are a mosaic of cultures and backgrounds, and we must learn about and embrace these differences. Now is the time to start incorporating these practices back into our daily lives. Embracing the Culture of Care often requires courage. It is scary to be vulnerable with new people and often requires selflessness. We challenge you to eat in your commons and invite someone new to sit with you next time you’re at lunch, and use that as a stepping stone to start incorporating the Culture of Care into your daily life. We know these actions aren’t easy. But these actions will ensure that what once was a cornerstone of the Rice community can again become second nature. We can rebuild the Rice community, together. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2022_83,"Thomas Ehrlich is an adjunct professor in the Stanford Graduate School of Education. “It Can’t Happen Here,” published in 1935, soon after Hitler became German Chancellor, is the story of a ruthless dictator elected president of the United States on a platform of traditional American values, as well as dramatic social and economic reforms. He quickly seizes all the levers of governmental power, supported by his own paramilitary forces. The novel was written by Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature. At the time, it was considered dystopian fantasy. But as Hitler quickly took total control of the German government, the book became a wake-up call to protect American democracy. Today, Ukrainian President Zelensky is giving a wake-up call for nations around the world to protect their democracies and is a role model for defending the freedoms that democracy affords. But unlike Ukraine, American democracy does not face its danger from another nation. Our democracy is at risk from within. Abraham Lincoln predicted this phenomenon could happen in an 1838 speech when he said, “if destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.” On January 6, 2021, an insurrection sought to overthrow our democracy, followed by 147 members of Congress voting to overturn the results of the presidential election. Our democracy escaped destruction, but it was a very close call. It is up to us — all of us — not to let our democracy die by suicide. I wish this were hyperbole, but it is not. What can each of us do? It is tempting to think, “Not much: I am just one American — how could I help save our democracy?” But there is much we can do. And if we don’t, it is certain that the level of destruction will increase. Our democracy is fragile and in critical need of strengthening in four key arenas: I encourage you to look at those four clusters of issues in terms of what is actually happening — or not happening — in your own state. It may be tempting to focus just on the national scene, and that scene is important. But most of the action in these arenas is happening in states, just as was true when the Supreme Court recognized the right of gay and lesbian couples to marry: two-thirds of the states had already done so. Pick an issue and find a way to help. It should be easy to vote. But the sad reality is that it has become much harder in many states. In Texas, for example, legislation passed last year bans counties from allowing 24-hour voting, prohibits drive-through voting, makes it much tougher to vote by mail and imposes other severe restrictions on the right to vote. Florida, Georgia and other states have adopted similar limitations. You can volunteer your time, your money or both for an organization to help defeat such restrictions before they are adopted by your state and reverse them when they are already law.Rock the Vote, a leader in the fight against voter suppression, has many ways to help. Gerrymanderinghas warped our elections and deprived millions of a fair say in who will represent them. Parties in power can ensure they stay in power by strategically drawing the lines of Congressional districts. Nonpartisan state commissions are an effective way to preclude such partisan action, and seven states have adopted this approach.

wildcat_arizona_2022_79,"The entrance to Counseling and Psych Services at Campus Health on Oct. 4 at the Highland Commons building. CAPS is located on the third floor of the building. Stress is a common feeling that many individuals experience on a daily basis. Life can bring about uncertainties and challenges that can cause individuals to feel stressed and overwhelmed. Many individuals don’t stop to think about the importance of listening to our emotions, thoughts and feelings and take time to eliminate and manage our stress. The month of April is Stress Awareness Month.The American Institute of Stressexplains that Stress Awareness Month has been recognized every year in April since 1992. “We all experience stress – yet we may experience it in very different ways. Because of this, there is no single definition for stress, but the most common explanation is a physical, mental, or emotional strain or tension,” the AIS stated. Leslie Ralphis a clinical psychologist at Counseling and Psych Services at the University of Arizona and she is also the coordinator of mental health promotion. She explains how April is a great month to start talking with friends and family about wellness in general, including emotional wellness or mental health. “Talk about what you do to practice self-care, the way you’re feeling, and what you do to manage stress. If you’re concerned about someone or someone’s reached out to you for support in the past, check in with them. Share information about stress awareness month and stress management,” Ralph said. Stress, anxiety and mental health in general are topics that many people are not open or comfortable with talking about. About 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. experience mental illness each year, according to the National Alliance of Mental Illness. The more we as a society continue to open up dialogue and share information, the more individuals will feel comfortable seeking help and support. “Our discomfort with talking about topics like this is a reflection of general societal messages about what makes someone strong or worthwhile. While it’s changing, there is still a stigma in our society about mental health and mental illness,” Ralph said. Working to create safe spaces and environments for individuals to feel comfortable talking about their emotions, feelings and mental health can help to start conversations and show support. “The way we talk and listen both play a huge part in whether it feel safe to open up about mental health. Strategies like active listening, reflecting back what you’ve heard and checking your understanding, and listening with the intention to understand rather than fix or jump to solutions can go a long way,” Ralph said. Mental health and taking care of ourselves is important at all times, and during Stress Awareness Month is a great time to begin. Ralph suggests making time for self-care which could include making sure you get enough rest, are well fed, moving your body, using tools and resources that will benefit your wellbeing and making time to enjoy life. “Each of us has the power to define what self-care means to us and to start talking more openly about the benefits of making self-care and well-being a priority,” Ralph said.

thetech_mit_2022_19,"Hearings held by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform in September reveal the failures of fossil fuel companies to live up to their pledges on reducing their environmental impact — and why we still have work to do. The hearings follow a year-long investigation by the Committee regarding the role of the fossil fuel industry in driving climate change. Before the hearings, the Committeereleased a memodocumenting internal emails and guidance from several Big Oil companies — including BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and Shell — that demonstrate their campaign to mislead the public while they fall short of reaching their climate goals. Among thediscoveriesrevealed in the memo, these companies made it clear that they are “devoted to a long-term fossil fuel future” and instructed employees to use intentionally misleading language when broaching the topic of climate change. For example, “Exxon and Chevron sought to water down statements by the industry-led Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI to ‘remove language that potentially commits members to enhanced climate-related governance, strategy, risk management, and performance metrics and targets’” in an apparent effort to avoid binding themselves to any climate commitments, despite eachpubliclystatingthe opposite. Additionally, internal messaging guidance from Shell “calls on employees to emphasize that net-zero emissions is ‘a collective ambition for the world’ rather than a ‘Shell goal or target,’” directly contradicting their own publicizedclimate target. These contradictions should come as no surprise, as they continue a long tradition of Big Oil companieslyingto the public about their role in worsening the climate crisis. “My Committee’s investigation leaves no doubt that, in the words of one company official, Big Oil is ‘gaslighting’ the public,” said Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, the Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. “These companies claim they are part of the solution to climate change, but internal documents reveal that they are continuing with business as usual.” Following the investigation and the release of the memo, the Committee held ahearingto examine the adequacy of the companies’ climate pledges and to hear testimony from survivors of climate change-induced severe weather events. Testimony from Raya Salter, Esq., founder and executive director of the Energy Justice Law and Policy Center and member of the New York State Climate Action Council,emphasizesthe failure of fossil fuel companies to hold true to their climate pledges. Salter states that “the fossil fuel company commitments are just frankly disingenuous. The fossil fuel lobby combats climate action on every single level — global, national, state, and regional.” Her statement supports the findings revealed in the memo, reinforcing the fact that Big Oil companies are lying about their climate commitments and failing to act on the issue of climate change. The hearing also sought to emphasize that marginalized communities throughout the U.S. — particularly low-income communities and communities of color —bear the brunt of climate changeand feel the strongest effects of the inaction of the fossil fuel industry. At the hearing, Dr. Isabella M. Weber, Assistant Professor of Economics at University of Massachusetts Amherst, stated, “Low-income households are clearly the ones that are hit hardest by the energy price explosion. They are the ones that have least means to weatherize their homes. Black and Brown communities face, on top of this, discrimination in the housing market, which means that they typically end up living in homes that are less well insulated or less energy efficient.” Another witness, Jasmin Sanchez, a survivor of Hurricane Sandy and public housing resident, stated, “Climate justice is a racial justice issue. Sandy showed the inequities in our city. If you didn’t have a car, you couldn’t leave. If you didn’t have financial means, you couldn’t relocate … I, along with many of my neighbors, were in survival mode.” Sanchez’s testimony demonstrates that the effects of climate change aren’t something far off in the distance — they are happening right here, right now, to real people. And the fossil fuel industry is intentionally making the climate crisis worse and harming the communities most at risk. These recent hearings made clear that the fossil fuel industry has not only fallen short of its climate pledges but has also spread misinformation and misled the public on its actions while continuing to contribute to the climate crisis and perpetuate violence against marginalized communities. Despite this, Big Oil companies continue to postrecord-breaking profits, with BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, and TotalEnergies producing a combined profit of $51 billion in the second quarter of 2022. While the effects of climate change grow worse each year, fossil fuel companies continue to profit off of the crisis that they helped create. So, why should we as MIT students care? The answer is simple: the MIT Corporation’s refusal to divest from the fossil fuel industry means that as these companies profit off of the climate crisis, so does MIT. If MIT wants to uphold its values and take responsibility for tackling the climate crisis, it mustdivestfrom the fossil fuel industry.

crimson_2022_139,"On April 29, I woke up to a flurry of messages from students, alumni, and journalists regarding anew piecepublished by The Crimson’s Editorial Board declaring it was “proud to finally lend our support to both Palestinian liberation and Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions ” and now would “call on everyone to do the same.” As both president of Harvard Hillel and Associate News Editor for The Crimson, many of the questions I received pertained to my dual affiliation with these two organizations, now seemingly at odds with one another. I have worked for The Crimson since freshman year, and it has been an integral part of my time at Harvard — some nights I am there until 2 or 3 a.m. as an executive, after four semesters of reporting. But integral as The Crimson has been, I am first and foremost a Jew; and in light of the role Israel plays in my people’s history as our homeland and haven from persecution, I am a Zionist, and I stand with Israel. People have asked me whether I plan on quitting, whether I could have prevented this, and who is to blame. I have no intention of quitting; I understand this piece does not reflect the views of other boards, or even the views of some members of the Editorial Board who may not have been at the meeting. We live in a country where peaceful protest is strongly encouraged. But the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement — overwhelmingly condemned by Congress in a2019 resolutionpassed 398-17 — is not just a boycott; BDS rejects Jewish self-determination altogether. If you doubt me, ask its founders: “Definitely, most definitely, we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine,”said co-founder Omar Barghouti, whoalso declaredthat Palestinians have a right to “resistance by any means, including armed resistance.” Perhaps the Editorial Board would agree, since its piece fails to condemn Palestinian terrorism or thecharter of Hamas— the governing regimeelected to power in Gazain 2006 — that explicitly calls for the annihilation of the Jewish people. On top of that, a 2019New York Times article reportedthat the BDS National Committee lists among its members the Council of National and Islamic Forces in Palestine, which in turn includes both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. How many members of the Editorial Board can tell me the story of Israel’s history — numerous peace treaties thePalestinians have rejected,human shields used by Hamasto gaslight Israel, and thousands ofIsraeli civilians murderedby terrorists? What about the millions of dollars used by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank for the“Pay to Slay” Program, rewarding terrorists for crimes against Israelis? Israel is not perfect, nor is any other country. But this editorial is part of a larger trend of singling out Jews, conveniently neglecting our half of the story — and by extension our right to self-determination — while claiming to “oppose antisemitism.” Judaism is not just a religion; the Holocaust is only one of many examples of Jews targeted as a people. Exiled after centuries in the Land of Israel, the Jewish people have always been outsiders — they have been pushed out of Europe and the Middle East, and2019 FBI data indicateAmerican Jews were 2.6 times more likely than Black people and 2.2 times more likely than Muslims to be victims of hate crimes. If this isn’t proof of a Jewish need for self-determination, I don’t know what is. And yet this editorial does not even affirm support for Jewish self-determination. Does the Editorial Board believe Israel even has a right to exist? Because, if so, that line is coincidentally missing. When the Editorial Board discusses “Palestinian liberation,” does it think that, after decades of rejected peace treaties and terror, Hamas and the PA would simply acquiesce and live in harmony with their Jewish neighbors? What does the Editorial Board think“from the river to the sea” means? The Editorial Board believes it is advocating for the underdog in the name of social justice, but the “overwhelming power imbalance” has always been against the Jewish homeland, surrounded on all sides by those who wish to destroy it — the same wish that has led Israel’s neighbors to declare war on it again and again. The leaders of Iran, now in the process ofacquiring nuclear weapons, have also made clear thattheir aim is “the annihilation of Israel.” I do my best to keep my personal views out of my work at The Crimson. My job is to report facts, and I welcome dialogue. But dialogue is not the goal of BDS or student anti-Israel groups, who have refused conversation and rely instead on substanceless platitudes like “Zionism is racism settler colonialism white supremacy apartheid” — their goal is demonizing Israel and delegitimizing its right to exist. And so when my people and our homeland come under attack, I will not stay silent. I am still a Crimson editor, but this editorial does not represent me; I do and always will stand with Israel. — Natalie L. Kahn ’23, an Associate News Editor, is president of Harvard Hillel and an Economics concentrator in Pforzheimer House."

The day we now celebrate as Earth Day began as a smörgasbord of teach-ins, tree plantings and protests across the United States on April 22, 1970. Supposedly, this date steers clear of spring breaks and final exams. But for us maple-tinged universities, it’s smack dab in the middle of examandmoving season. What’s more, they had to put it right next toanother green holiday. How do they expect us to have such stamina? All jokes aside, the Earth has done so much to support us, and the steps we take to care for our planet can also help us grow more connected with our community. Here are some sustainability and climate justice efforts you can take part in at UBC this summer.

stanforddaily_2022_17,"The U.S. Supreme Court sent shockwaves throughout the country this June by overturningRoe v. Wade, the landmark decision deeming abortion a constitutional right. I happened to check my social media feed that day, unsuspectingly, while visiting family in Pakistan. After spending the day with my relatives, excitedly discussing the strides being made for women’s rights in Pakistan, it was surreal to learn that those same rights were under threat back home in America. Given the influence of the U.S. on the world stage, I was left wondering whether the aftermath of the Court’s decision could have an impact on women in Pakistan, or in other developing nations struggling to advance reproductive healthcare. That question led me to discover that, for decades before pro-life activists even challengedRoe v. Wadein court, the United States has already been keeping abortion inaccessible to millions of desperate people worldwide by using an unlikely tool: foreign aid policy. The Helms Amendment is a policy that makes it illegal for U.S. foreign aid funds to bespent on the “performance of abortion as a method of family planning.”Enacted in 1973, the amendment was passed in retaliation toRoe v. Wadeand aimed to block humanitarian efforts to help foreign governments provide abortions. Today, even thoughnearly 50 other nations have since liberalized their abortion laws, this deeply antiquated policy remains U.S. federal law. The United Statesis the largest bilateral donor for family planning assistance in the world, but as long as the Helms Amendment is enforced, none of that funding can be used for programs that provide safe abortions. The term “family planning” may not sound like a severe humanitarian issue; however, being able to control one’s reproductive health can be a matter of life or death for women living amid violence or extreme misogyny. The World Health Organizationfinds that over one in three women in the world’s poorest nations have experienced physical and/or sexual abuse, putting them at higher risk of unwanted pregnancy. Preventing these individuals from accessing safe abortions can lead to lifelong poverty or even death, due to high maternal mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The harms that a lack of family planning access have on developing nations are manifold. It keeps families, communities and entire countries trapped in poverty due to unsustainable population growth. Additionally, it worsens food and water insecurity, since many nations that rely on U.S. aid have scarce resources due toclimate change. Most insidiously, it keeps impoverished women trapped in a system of intergenerational oppression. Where my family originates from in Pakistan, rural women in village communities are often pressured into marriage and motherhood at an early age, even at the cost of their education. Of course, one can argue that increasing abortion access won’t fix these persistent issues due to factors like cultural norms or a lack of education about contraceptives. However, the U.S.’s refusal to fund organizations that provide abortion access makes it more difficult for aid workers to change mindsets or increase contraceptive use, as seen through the example of the global gag rule. The “global gag rule,” or Mexico City Policy, is a companion to the Helms Amendment instituted by Ronald Reagan in 1984. The gag rule prevents foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs and health clinics from using U.S. funds to provide abortion services, information, or counseling. A key example is International Planned Parenthood, which wasforced to scale back its contraceptive education and counseling programs from 2001 to 2009 after losing U.S. funding.Since Reagan’s presidency, the gag rule has been temporarily rescinded by Democratic presidents, such asBarack Obama, only to beenforced againby Republican presidents, such as Donald Trump, in an endless partisan tug-of-war. Enforcing the gag rule has had devastating results; a policy brief by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research found that when the policy was enforced,abortions in sub-Saharan countries — many of them unsafe — increasedby as much as 40%, whereas contraceptive use fell. Much like how banning abortions leads to anincrease in “back-alley jobs” in the U.S., defunding programs that provide safe abortions in the developing world only increases the number of unsafe procedures performed out of desperation. Luckily, President Biden has alreadyrescindedthe global gag rule via executive order earlier this year. However, this is only a temporary fix for the larger problem: the global gag rule and the Helms Amendment will remain permanent law, ready to be enforced by the next Republican president, unless Congress repeals both policies. This midterm season, abortion rights have been front-and-center in many Democratic political campaigns, but America’s outdated and dangerously anti-abortion foreign policy has remained unaddressed. Nancy Stearn, an attorney who challenged abortion bans back in the 1970s, described the importance of abortion accessbest in an interview with The New York Times:“If you cannot control your reproductive life, you cannot control your life.” This reality is felt as harshly by Americans as it is by a woman in Pakistan struggling to determine how she will raise another child. For women in developing nations to empower themselves, they need to have control over what happens to their bodies. This basic right may have been revoked in our country, but the fight to protect it is not over. Repealing the Helms Amendment and gag rule and safeguarding global access to reproductive health must be a priority in our efforts to protect the right to choose.

stanforddaily_2022_130,"This series from the community features members of the SAPAAC Asian American Studies Coalition from different generations, sharing their first-hand experiences as Asian Americans on campus. Visitwww.sapaac.org(Stanford Asian Pacific American Alumni Club to find out more about the coalition’s efforts to advocate for Asian American Studies at Stanford. We urge Stanford to provide funding and resources to hire and retain a diverse body of faculty to teach Asian American Studies (AAS courses. We graduated Stanford as AAS majors in the early 2010s and experienced the program’s institutional challenges. Especially given the recent departure of Dr. William Gow — who taught several popular courses, including Introduction to Asian American Studies — we are disappointed that a decade after our graduation, difficulties attracting and retaining instructors who teach AAS courses persist. To this day, AAS at Stanford cannot hire its own tenure-track faculty. AAS depends on professors from other departments and lecturers, primarily from other universities, to teach courses. When we were students, the quantity and availability of AAS classes each year was uncertain. The breadth of courses was limited. Few instructors taught more than one AAS class a year or could provide stable, long-term mentorship in the field. We had to be very intentional to major in AAS.We wanted to study a field driven by social justice and that teaches our histories. Majoring in AAS at Stanford, however, comes with institutional challenges.To ensure we completed our AAS major in addition to our other academic and extracurricular interests, we designed and redesigned four-year academic plans meticulously, with the support of many outside the program, such as theAsian American Activities Center, starting from the end of freshman year or the beginning of sophomore year. This process included self-advocating for independent research units so we could meet unit requirements and seeking mentors from other disciplines to conduct our research. This careful calculus is not possible for many students. Many peers told us that they were discouraged from majoring, minoring or taking a class in AAS because of these institutional hurdles. Majoring, minoring or taking a class in AAS at Stanford should not be difficult. Even more frustrating was when Stanford denied tenure to Professor Stephen Sohn in 2013. Professor Sohn was an Assistant Professor in English who taught many classes cross-listed with AAS. He was well-published and a mentor to us and countless other students. He won numerous awards for his teaching, including theWalter J. Gores Award, which is Stanford’s highest award for excellence in teaching.Students and communities ralliedaround reconsideration of Professor Sohn’s case for tenure, but his case was not reopened. Professor Sohn left Stanford in the summer of 2014. Stanford’s professed goals of increasing faculty diversity, teaching inclusive curriculum, and developing global leaders is lip-service. In 2018, we started hearing about a wonderful new professor who was teaching AAS courses, and that students were very excited about him. Dr. Gow dramatically helped increase the number of AAS majors and minors, and he taught foundational courses like “Introduction to AAS,” which had not been taught in over a decade. Funding for Dr. Gow’s AAS courses was scarce and cobbled together from different sources. Dr. Gow was initially hired on a one-year contract through American Studies. The initial job announcement in American Studies did not request any AAS courses, and it was Dr. Gow who proposed that he teach them. AAS and History provided the additional funding that enabled Dr. Gow to teach AAS courses. Further, at the end of the academic year, Dr. Gow did not know if his position in American Studies would be renewed. AAS cannot and should not be sustained this way. It is clear that Stanford drastically underfunds AAS. With an endowment of$41.9 billion as of October 2021, Stanford itself should be funding multiple tenure-track positions and multiple full-time lecturers in AAS, and any additional fundraising monies should be used for endowed chairs and programming. Instead, Stanford has so far not provided funding for even one full-time lecturer position in AAS. It is an embarrassment that Stanford depends on alumni donations, financial good-will from departments and the initiative of individuals who offer to teach AAS courses just to eke out one or two foundational AAS courses a year. Dr. Gow left Stanford for Cal State University, Sacramento (Sac State in the summer of 2021.Sac State recognized the importance of attracting and retaining faculty like Dr. Gow, and offered him a tenure-track AAS position. In response, Stanford offered Dr. Gow a three-year Associate Director position of AAS. The position had a reduced teaching load, but could laterdisappear, at which point Dr. Gow onlymightbe able to return as a lecturer on a limited-term contract. After it was announced, Sac State’s Ethnic Studies Department felt the applicant pool was so strong that it asked to hire a second tenure-track AAS position, which the Cal State University administration approved. Therefore, Sac State was able to give two tenure-track job offers:Dr. Gow and Dr. Wendi Yamashita.At the time, Sac State already had three tenure-track positions in AAS along with a number of full-time lecturers. In contrast, Stanford, an institution that conducts and publishesresearch about the benefits of ethnic studies,has no tenure-track or full-time lecturers in AAS. Professor Sohn left Stanford nearly seven years ago. He continues to mentor us and others, however, by advising us about navigating the workplace as young professionals and connecting us with his undergraduate students who are interested in learning more about our careers. Professor Sohn is currently an endowed chair atFordham University, and his latest book won the2020 Asian American Studies Book Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Humanities and Cultural Studies.By failing to retain Professor Sohn, Stanford deprived generations of Stanford students incredible opportunities to learn and conduct cutting-edge scholarship.We can only imagine the loss that comes with Dr. Gow’s recent departure. Stanford is losing brilliant instructors who can teach AAS, and actively facilitates that attrition. Stanford has a history of undervaluing the contributions of professors who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC or whose scholarship focuses on BIPOC people, such asAishwary Kumarand Akhil Gupta. If Stanford capitalizes on the labor of instructors in fields like AAS and wants to practice what it preaches regarding itscommitment to diversity, equity and inclusion,then it needs to treat the people who teach these courses with respect and offer competitive packages that attract and retain them. There are many ethical, academic and competitive reasons to hire and retain a diverse body of faculty to teach AAS courses at Stanford, especially when the University is located in California,where ethnic studies is a required class to graduate from high schooland fromCal State Universities and community colleges.In the end, it is up to Stanford to stop systematically undermining AAS and start a good-faith investment in faculty who contribute to its vibrancy. Anything less is an affront to Stanford’s students and scholarship. Victoria Yee, Esq.

wildcat_arizona_2022_55,"Starbucks barista James Pack whips up a latte on Sunday, April 24 in the Starbucks on University Boulevard. Workers at the Starbucks on University and Euclid Avenue voted to unionize on July 6, 2022. On July 6, the Starbucks at University Boulevard and Euclid Avenue voted to unionize and won the vote according to reporterMegan Myscofski from Arizona Public Media. This Starbucks location adds to the 180+ stores that have been unionized on the heels of a national movement headed byStarbucks Workers United. It’s about time corporations start supporting their employees by increasing their pay, work benefits, hours and more. The Tucson Starbucks employees’ decision to unionize is a step in the right direction. According totheMerriam-Webster dictionary, a labor union is, “an organization of workers formed for the purpose of advancing its members’ interests in respect to wages, benefits, and working conditions.” This negotiation process is calledcollective bargainingand it gives employees power against employers who try to take advantage of them. Unions apply the philosophy of strength in numbers to even the playing field with Corporate America and other big firms. According to a report by theJoint Economic Committee Democrats, union employees earn 10.2% more than their non-union coworkers. Unions also have done their part in narrowing economic disparities amongst genders and races. Added benefits of being a union employee according to the same report are that union employees have more control over their work schedules as well as better health insurance (union employees are 18.3% more likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance . Unions are advocates for union employees, and they make sure to keep management in line whenever they try to take advantage of their workers. Therate of unionizationhas grown greatly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the poor treatment frontline workers endured by big companies likeAmazon and Walmart. It’s tragic to see that it took a global pandemic to expose the poor working conditions these frontline workers endure and force these companies to look past profit and shareholder interest. Mistreatment is still prevalent in the workplace and instead of coming up with ways to compromise with employees, companies like Starbucks continue to antagonize its employees and find ways to squeeze out the employees who vocalize the mistreatment (union busting . As detailed byInsider reporter Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert, employees from a Phoenix Starbucks have described the retaliation they’ve faced as a union employee: cut hours, write-ups, denied accommodations and even blatant disrespect. Such treatment of union employees highlights the fear establishments have of the power of unions and the capabilities they have to create change in the workplace. There are a few valid concerns that come with the establishment of unions, however. First off, unions cancreate an environment of tension and hostility between union employees and managementthat can hinder the productivity of the workplace. Since unions serve as a middle man of sorts between union employees and management, it makes it hard for the two to develop trust in one another. Unions have a negative association with creating trouble for management while employees may view management as an obstacle in their lives. When establishments give in to demands — for example, increasing wages — those managerial changes lead to increased management costs andhigher prices for consumers. And as consumers, when something gets too expensive, we find an alternative. Firing union employees is also very difficult to do. As explained byHR Exchange writer Mason Stevenson, there are specific guidelines for firing union employees which can lead to establishments being unable to fire an incompetent employee or promote a competent employee due to the seniority aspect of unions. What the employees of the Tucson Starbucks did was very brave. They are putting themselves in danger of retaliation from Starbucks management which could very much lead to them losing their jobs. It’s our responsibility as customers to show support for the employees of Starbucks by continuing to give our business there. There are also other forms of support that we as customers can show for Starbucks employees. If you wish not to directly support the Starbucks company, you can contribute to theStarbucks Workers Fund, which is a fund that supports unionized employees who’ve either had their hours cut, been fired or have had their stores shut down as explained byTruth Out writer Michael M. Santiago. Keeping yourself updated and spreading the news of the unionization movement whether by word-of-mouth or through social media can do wonders. Just like how employees have bargaining power over their labor, we have bargaining power over where we take our business. It’s very likely that prices will increase due to the unionization, but this shouldn’t deter us from still purchasing our Frappuccinos or iced coffees there. We have the opportunity to help show these big corporations like Starbucks that consumers support unionized stores and will continue to support them no matter the pressures and anti-union tactics waged against unionized workers. Like with any issue, it’s important for one to conduct research in order to truly understand the extent and impact the issue has on the world. After endless reports of employee mistreatment from a variety of Starbucks stores and the company’s response to the threat of unionization in their stores, it’s clear that a change needs to be made. There are many university students or people around my age that work tirelessly in these places – and this movement matters to them. Whether it be to put themselves through college or to simply live their lives, every person deserves to be recognized in the workplace as a person instead of just labor.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_33,"Earlier this month, a Florida Senate committee approved theParental Rights in Educationbill, commonly known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, in a blatant attempt to promote LGBTQ+ erasure. Introduced by Republican State Sen. Dennis Baxley, the bill would prohibit Florida school districts from encouraging discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in a non “age-appropriate” or “developmentally appropriate” way, as well as enable parents to take legal action against districts who refuse to comply. This bill will be detrimental to the health of LGBTQ+ students in Florida, shaming their identities and shrinking their support system. For starters, the terms of this bill fail to define what a non “age-appropriate” discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity constitutes, opening the door for the bias of parents and judges to impact its enforcement. Regardless, there shouldn’t be any subjectivity towards when it is appropriate for children to learn about sexuality and gender identity. If a child is old enough to learn that men and women can love each other, they can learn that everyone can love each other. Though the idea of gender may seem more complicated to adults, the social construct of gender has not been as ingrained in children as it has been for us. Our understanding of stereotypical gender roles differ from one another. Children are blank slates, and by trying to shield them from reality, the supporters of the “Don’t Say Gay” bill are trying to maintain our heteronormative (the view of heterosexuality as the preferred sexual orientation society’s biases against LGBTQ+ individuals. The bill won’t stop children from identifying as LGBTQ+ either, so what are Florida politicians trying to prevent? I didn’t even know that the word “bisexual” existed until I was 14; yet when I did learn it, it wasn’t in school or health class. Despite not being taught about it, I identified with the group immediately. The lack of education and outward support had a negative impact on my mental health, and many LGBTQ+ youth share similar stories. We are an extremely vulnerable segment of the population. The Trevor Project — a nonprofit organization dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth —reportedin 2021 that 42% of LGBTQ+ youth “seriously considered attempting suicide” within the past year. Preventing discussions about sexuality and gender will also send a message to LGBTQ+ youth that something is wrong with them and will possibly discourage teachers from supporting such students. Since school districts could face being sued for violating the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, teachers could face adverse consequences for any infractions. Even if a teacher does not support the bill, they should not be forced to choose between their livelihoods and their students’ well-being. Supportive instructors were highlights in my high school experience and they can have a great positive impact on students’ lives. It’s shameful that this bill would undermine them. The “Don’t Say Gay” bill also specifies that school districts would have to implement procedures for notifying parents of changes relevant to their student’s “mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being.” Essentially, information such as the student’s sexuality would have to be reported to their guardian(s . Another clause states that the information can be withheld upon reasonable suspicion of consequences like abuse, but there is ultimately no way for any district’s administration to predict the parents’ reaction. The Trevor Project alsofoundthat only about one in three LGBTQ+ youth marked their homes as “LGBTQ-affirming.” Forcing students into a situation where their parents are judgmental or even hostile towards them because of their sexuality or gender identity is awful. Children should get to decide if, when, and how they notify their parents of their identity. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis displayed support for the bill, stating that parents need “a seat at the table” concerning their child’s education. However, it is clear that DeSantis wants only a certain demographic of parents to benefit from this bill. No parent in the LGBTQ+ community would reasonably support it, and nor would most Democrat parents. According to aGallup pollfrom Jun. 2021, 83% of Democrats support same-sex marriage, compared to only 55% of Republicans. DeSantis is surely aware of this difference, suggesting his desire to enable Republican parents who are more likely to disapprove of the LGBTQ+ community to express their hatred through their children. The “Don’t Say Gay” bill was crafted to mold children into being just as ignorant and hateful as their Republican parents. The bill’s advocates are seeking to push back against the social and political progress that LGBTQ+ individuals have made in America. They are attempting to suppress a group that needs to be supported. Evidently, the “Republican agenda” is more dangerous than the “gay agenda.” Daniel Waters is an Opinion Intern for the 2022 winter quarter. He can be reached atdlwaters@uci.edu."
crimson_2022_84,"Goodbye, Roe: the Supreme Court’s 6-3 conservative majorityis poised to overturnRoe v. Wade by the end of the term. These six conservative Justices recently seemed inclined to discard decades of precedent in their support for a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Such a decision could set the Supreme Court up to legitimize a raft of state-level abortion bans: from a Texas lawputting a bountyon the heads of abortion-seekers, to an Oklahoma lawprohibiting abortion30 days after the “probable” start of a pregnancy. You might think that none of those states are Massachusetts, that we’re safe here. In the short-term, you might be right: Massachusetts has some ofthe widest abortion access in the country. Eighty-seven percent of Massachusetts women live in counties with abortion clinics. Abortion pillsare accessible through telemedicine. Abortion is even a covered service under the Harvard University Student Health Program. If Roe were overturned tomorrow, Massachusetts residents would still beprotected by the state-level ROE Act, which permits abortions after 24 weeks when deemed necessary by a physician and lowers the age of abortion without consent from a parent or judge from 18 to 16. These are important provisions and we should be grateful forthe activists who pushed for them. But reproductive justice protections in nearby states like New Hampshire and Pennsylvania are not as comprehensive. In a post-Roe world, Boston will be an oasis for abortion care. Patients will need airfare, child care, and places to stay. They may need help covering legal fees back home. Many Texas women, after being denied abortions at home, got them anyway in neighboring states: One Oklahoma clinic, for example,has seen a 10-fold increasein Texan patients since the Texas law was passed. A comparable increase in abortion caseloads in Massachusetts would strainexisting support networksand demand the creation of new ones. That’s assuming the pro-life movement stops at overturning Roe. But it won’t. Mail-order medication abortions, a lifeline for Americans who cannot access clinics,are being targetedin red states. States with bounty-oriented laws like Texas and Missouri are attempting to expand their laws past state boundaries, punishing those who return home after seeking care out-of-state. In encouraging individual citizens to turn in their neighbors, and those who help them, in exchange for money from the state, these effortsecho centuries-old fugitive slave laws. The language of a proposed Missouri law even parallels thatfrom the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850: “It shall be unlawful for any person to perform or induce, or to attempt to perform or induce, an abortion on a resident or citizen of Missouri, or to aid or abet, or attempt to aid or abet, an abortion performed or induced on a resident or citizen of Missouri, regardless of where the abortion is or will be performed.” It is no coincidence that the modern versions of such laws will be applied disproportionately to marginalized women of color. Black women are alreadyfive times more likelythan white women to seek an abortion; punitive laws like Missouri’s will only perpetuate racial disparities in health services. You might think all of this is the inevitable direction of our divided, post-Trump society. But it’s not.A majority of Americansbelieve abortion should be legal in most or all cases, a belief which holds across geography, race, and most religions — including 83 percent of Jews, 68 percent of Hindus, 60 percent of mainline Protestants, and even 48 percentof Catholics. Since 2000, at least 31 countries have expanded abortion access;only three have rolled it back. In the past years, we have watched pro-choice activists celebrate in the streets of Dublin, Bogotá, and Buenos Aires. Our country could be moving in this direction, too — if only we started to act. We simply cannot sit still or feel complacent in the relative safety of our state. It’s time to start having difficult conversations about abortion access in all our communities. The National Coalition of Jewish Women hasa great toolkitfor broaching those conversations with religiously conservative relatives. Make a donation to theEastern Massachusetts Abortion Fund— or even better,volunteer. Join other Harvard students and Boston-area activists in their calls to action.

stanforddaily_2022_40,"This June, a New York Timesinvestigationfoundthat NFL quarterback Deshaun Watson booked massage appointments with at least 66 different masseuses between fall 2019 and spring 2021. Over the past year, more than 20 womenhave accusedWatson of sexual misconduct and coercive behavior during these appointments. The descriptions of his actions are extremely disturbing. But something else in the investigation also caught my eye: Watson had tried to portray himself as a trusted ally to multiple Black female massage therapists, claiming that he was trying to “support Black businesses.” Targeting his messaging based on the interplay of gender, race, and class, Watson took advantage of two things that our society and our laws, unfortunately, have yet to fully understand: 1 Sexual assault is a function of power asymmetries, and 2 Power asymmetries are fundamentally intersectional. The #MeToo movement helped survivors across the world speak their truth, but some survivors consistently were – and continue to be – left out. The Washington Post’s global opinions editor, Karen Attiah,arguedin 2017 that the #MeToo movement has been confined to white-collar professional jobs and that we need to shed light on abuses in service industries like restaurants and domestic help, where women of color already face harder barriers. Attorney and activist Saru Jayaramanwritesthat the restaurant industry has the highest rates of sexual harassment of any comparable industry in America. The restaurant workforce is70% women, disproportionately women of color, who are often paid$2.13 an hour(the minimum federal cash wage for tipped employees and have to rely on tips for the rest of their wages, creating a system where they are essentially forced to tolerate sexual advances from customers in order to make a living wage. Power dynamics are evident in the Deshaun Watson case. As New York Timesreporter Jenny Vrentasreflected, many of the survivors “are relatively anonymous massage therapists who didn’t get the same kind of credibility that well-known actresses did when they came forward against Harvey Weinstein.” “On the one hand, you have a powerful, rich athlete backed by a powerful, rich sports league,” Vrentasstated. “And on the other hand, you have people who are often the least listened to in our society, women, many of them women of color, working in massage therapy just trying to make a living.” In 1991, Anita Hill accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Thomas, denying the allegations, infamouslyaccusedthe white male Senate Judiciary Committee of complicity in a “high-tech lynching for uppity Blacks.” This statement set the script for the hearings, with race as the focus–but only Thomas’s race. Luke C. Harris, Associate Professor of American Politics and Constitutional Law at Vassar College,asksa key question that was largely left out of the conversation: When, in the history of American society, has a Black woman ever participated in the lynching of a Black man? After Thomas used the lynching metaphor, his approval ratings in the Black communityincreasedfrom 52% to over 80%, and Anita Hill was often seen as a“race traitor”demonstrating“betrayal and disregard of Black men everywhere.” In 2018, when the Women of Color branch of the Time’s Up movement pledged their support for the #MuteRKelly campaign, boycotting the singer due to several well-documented allegations of sexual misconduct, R. Kelly’s managementreplied: “Since America was born, black men and women have been lynched for having sex or for being accused of it. We will vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.” Almost all of Kelly’s accusers were Black. Again – when, in the history of American society, has a Black woman ever participated in the lynching of a Black man? We can’t pick and choose which axes we focus on, with race alone on one side and gender alone on the other. Without investigating the intersection, we can’t fully grasp, in feminist philosopher Amia Srinivasan’s words, the “disturbing genius at work in the white mythology about Black sexuality.” In her bestseller “The Right to Sex,”Srinivasan writes: “By portraying black men as rapists and black women as unrapeable – two sides, as Angela Davis says, of the coin of black hypersexuality – the white mythos produces a tension between black men’s quest to exonerate themselves and black women’s need to speak out against sexual violence, including the violence perpetrated against them by black men. The result is the doubled sexual subordination of black women.” In both the Clarence Thomas and R. Kelly cases, we see that the false stereotype that historically “made the lynching of black men possible – the logic of black hypersexuality – is repurposed, at the level of metaphor, to falsely indict black women as the true oppressors.” What are the repercussions of speaking out for Black women in such situations, when they’re oftencriticizedfor treasonously bringing down those from their community who “made it,” and when they’re blamed for relying on a racist criminal justice system for protection (Srinivasan ? What does speaking out look like for LGBTQ+ people, when making public allegations about sexual harassmentconflictswith protecting themselves from an oppressive state or from a homophobic home environment? What does speaking out look like for people with disabilities, when they oftenfaceharassment in heavily institutionalized environments with in-built power dynamics, and when they fear that speaking out about abuse in intimate relationships will result in theloss of their care system? All of these burdens, of course, only add to the countlessrepercussionsthat survivors of all backgrounds face for speaking out, such as retaliation from perpetrators and victim-blaming. Black, indigenous, queer and disabled people, among others, have long suffered the paradox of invisibility and hypervisibility: invisible in places of power, yet hypervisible in public discourse on criminality and abnormality. In an essay on the exclusion of LGBTQ+ voices in #MeToo, Peter Dunne, Senior Lecturer at the University of Bristol Law School,describesthe imposition of medical treatments as a pre-condition for legal gender recognition in several countries; he argues that by legitimizing transgender bodies as a space of public discourse, interrogation, and judgment, these laws normalize disrespect for transgender dignity and physical integrity in private spaces as well. Dunne also describes how stereotypes that women cannot be perpetrators, that men should be able to effectively defend themselves, and that gay men are hypersexual influence the extent to which queer survivors are believed. Lucy-Ann Buckley, Senior Lecturer in Law at National University of Ireland, Galway,discusses“disability myths” that women with disabilities are asexual or hypersexual, or that girls with intellectual disabilities do not need sex education because they can’t make their own decisions about sexual activity. A 2021Associated Press articlereflecting on the R. Kelly case explains how the obstacles hindering Black women and girls from speaking out “are raised even higher by a society that hypersexualizes them from a young age, stereotyping them as promiscuous and judging their physiques, and in a country with a history of racism and sexism that has long denied their autonomy over their own bodies.” The article also citesa 2017 study from the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequalitydemonstrating that Black girls at all ages, when compared to white girls, are perceived as more adult, in need of less protection, and more knowledgeable about sex. “For years, girls suffering at R. Kelly’s hands were treated as more of a punchline than a travesty,” Associated Presswrites. Intersecting axes of oppression consign certain people to paradox: invisible and hypervisible, unrapeable and therefore all the more rapeable (Srinivasan . When they speak out, will they be heard? And will they even get to speak out? Before concluding, I’ll briefly discuss intersectionality in the context of perpetrators. Understanding the intersectionality of perpetrators is essential, first, to understand the intersectionality of survivors, and second, to work towards ending sexual violence, rather than just punishing offenders. In “The Right to Sex,” Amia Srinivasan argues that the #MeToo movement does not demonstrate any widespread conspiracy against men, but there has always been a conspiracy against certain men. Any student of race relations in America is familiar with how the false accusation of rape of a white woman by a Black man was used time and time again to imprison and execute innocent Black men as pawns in power plays. Srinivasan writes that stereotypes of Black women as chronically promiscuous that persist today are inextricably linked to the myth of Black men as rapists. Black and Dalit women are made more vulnerable to sexual violence when we reinforce the sexual stigmatization of Black and Dalit men, she states: “t heir ability to speak out against the violence they face from men of their race or caste is stifled, and their status as counterpart to the oversexed black or Dalit male is entrenched.” Intersectionality complicates the “Believe women” ethos central to #MeToo. The “zero-sum logic – she’s telling the truth, he’s lying – presumes that nothing but sex difference is at work in the assessment of rape allegations,” Srinivasan writes. “Whom are we to believe,” she asks, “the white woman who says she was raped, or the black or brown woman who insists that her son is being set up? Carolyn Bryant or Mamie Till?” Intersectionality also complicates questions of punishment and accountability. Will relying on an oppressive criminal justice system that targets minorities really help us achieve sexual justice? These are difficult questions that many groups, such as the Black Lives Matter movement and the prison abolition community, areworkingon. It’s messy, and this op-ed only begins to scratch the surface of scholarship on intersectionality in sexual violence. For example, due to limited space, this essay does not address #MeToo around the globe, but understanding the global implications of this movement is key to a thorough assessment of intersectionality in sexual violence. Numerous axes, from religion and immigrant status to military occupation and vulnerability to climate change disasters, shape power dynamics as well but have not been discussed in this article. I don’t promise to have answers, or to have asked all the right questions. But what I want to say is that while #MeToo changed the world, we still have so much work to do. That adopting a one-size-fits-all vision of the #MeToo movement risks silencing the same people who have always been silenced, dehumanizing the same people that have always been dehumanized. That rather than circumstantially choosing which aspects of individual identity we choose to elevate without any acknowledgment of context, as in the rhetoric pushed by Clarence Thomas and R. Kelly, we need to understand how the multiple intersecting identities of perpetrators and survivors shape the power dynamics involved, and confront head-on the tough questions posed by intersectionality. Feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnoncallssexual assault a crime of inequality, and I think it’s time our society and laws understood that inequality is necessarily intersectional."
thetech_mit_2022_58,"On April 4 and 5, some of MIT’s graduate students will participate in an National Labor Relations Board-run election to determine whether to form a union associated with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America. Whatever the outcome of this election, all of us who lead MIT will continue to support every one of our extraordinarily talented students. Like every institution, we will always have room for improvement. Those of us who have devoted our lives to MIT and making it a place of excellence and belonging for generations of our students, are deeply aware that we must always strive to do better. We respect and admire all of our graduate students and are committed to ensuring that each of them thrives during their time here. Indeed, it is our deep interest in our students’ work and success that has led us to embrace roles in student support and academic life, rather than focusing solely on our teaching and research. And it’s why we’re invested in strengthening MIT’s uniquely effective collaboration with its student leaders — an approach that has been advocated by the Institute’s student community, is in keeping with MIT’s spirit and values, and informs MIT’s work to create a more caring and supportive environment for everyone. Over the past five years, our direct partnership with graduate student leaders, including the Graduate Student Council (GSC and other representatives, has led to many substantive improvements for MIT’s graduate students, including: Greater financial security for all students:MIT’s cost-of-living-based stipend increases — part of a process led by the GSC — have outpaced those at nearly all private universities with graduate student unions. Throughout the pandemic, MIT offered its students generous assistance with housing costs, moving expenses, and other financial burdens. MIT has invested in students with the most pressing needs:The Institute has introduced new programs through which we have allocated approximately $1 million in grants for graduate students with families, students on short-term appointments, and doctoral students needing longer-term support. MIT has provided enhanced health and wellness support:MIT Medical continues to offer excellent, robusthealth insurance optionswith premiums that areon par with or less expensive than our peersand has expanded copay-free access to behavioral health care outside of MIT Medical from 12 visits per year to 52. MIT has championed its international students:In 2020, MIT joined with Harvard University insuccessfully filing suit against the U.S, Department of Homeland Securityto rescind a federal policy that would have barred international students on F-1 visas from taking a full online course load while studying in the United States. And to help manage the challenges that the pandemic presented for its international graduate students, MIT allocated $5.8 million to facilitate roughly 1,300 remote international appointments. This ensured that students did not face interruptions to their academic and research progress, and were able to continue their studies and research from abroad. MIT has worked to build a more inclusive, supportive, and diverse community:It hashired school-based diversity deans; increased staffing in theInternational Students Office,Career Advising and Professional Development, andGradSupport; added an employee to provide dedicated support for veterans and created aGrad Families Office; investedadditional resources in its Violence Prevention and Response and Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response offices; refinedanti-retaliation policies; providedguaranteed transitional fundingfor students who wish to change research advisors or groups; and offered additionalmentoring and harassment-prevention training. MIT has fostered students’ personal and professional growth:It has enhanced advising and training, offering more than 40 workshops and panels in partnership with 15 academic and administrative departments and developing more focused career fairs and networking opportunities. As we draw closer to the election April 4–5, now is the time for graduate students to become as informed as possible on these matters. It is essential that every eligible student make it a priority to vote: This election’s outcome will be determined by a simple majority of those who vote, but will be binding on both voters and non-voters in theproposed bargaining unit."
stanforddaily_2022_126,"The Stanford Daily takes great pride in its efforts to inform and serve our campus community. One way we do this is through reporting on crime that occurs on campus by publishing a weekly Police Blotter, which consists of a selection of incidents as recorded in the Stanford University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS bulletin and articles about AlertSU incidents. However, The Daily recognizes that many students and community members of color, especially Black individuals, feel uncomfortable and fearful when such reporting is published, as it puts marginalized groups at risk of racial profiling and discrimination. This runs contrary to The Daily’s mission of serving the Stanford community with timely and impactful journalism. With this in mind, we created a crime coverage policy to guide our reporting going forward. The policy has been added to our publicpolicies and standards pageand reads as follows: The Daily does not include race and ethnicity in its coverage of crimes around campus as of Dec. 1, 2021. There are three exceptions to this principle: It is our hope that this policy will reduce feelings of discomfort that stem from our coverage of crime while also allowing us to continue reporting on information that can help keep our community safe.

crimson_2022_92,"I see the bones of my hand moving under my skin like waves under a frozen lake. My metacarpals glide with intention, wanting to do more, more, more. I think about the vessels and veins that carry my blood, and I consider if that blood is completely mine. Mitochondrial DNA is passed down through maternal inheritance; I received my mDNA from my mother, who inherited hers from her mother (my grandmother , who inherited hers from her mother (my great-grandmother . I think about this a lot: the chain of women whom I’m related to, who have passed down this mDNA to me. I will never learn the names of all the women I’m related to; they will never know that I exist. We are destined to share only genetic history — not hobbies, memories, or time spent together. Still, I wonder: Would they like me? Just how much of them is in me? When I look at myself in the mirror, am I actually looking at pieces of them? Is there a pastiche of features from women whom I don’t recognize within my own face? History has not been kind to women. When I think about the past that my female ancestors lived during, I wonder how they were able to summon the persistence and bravery to live through difficult times. As someone currently living through a pandemic and political turbulence, I have realized that living through history is primarily just challenging. We often think that history is abstract, something that happens to other people — other generations — until we find ourselves amidst new events that make us scared for the future. How were my female ancestors able to quell their fears enough to strive in the face of an uncertain future? How were they able to keep going despite not fully knowing what the future might hold for women, for their granddaughters? Women today have more rights than women in previous generations, but there was no guarantee for the women of my past that this would eventually be the case. Yet, they kept persisting. In the face of a world that did not care for them, did not extend support or sympathy or grace to them, did not effectively compensate them for labor (inside or outside the home , they kept moving forward. How brave did they have to be to look an uncertain future and hostile world in the eyes and declare that it wouldn’t break them? How titanium must their spines have been to decide that their granddaughters should have better lives than them? How drivenly optimistic did they have to be to protest, advocate, and fight for the rights of women who would come after them? As I walk around campus, I’m frequently reminded of the history of this place, ofRadcliffe Collegeand thewomen who studied there. I’m a Harvard student, but my place here belies the collective ongoing struggle of women who seek higher education, particularly women of color. I benefit from the sacrifices of nameless women. I have been told that I can be anything I want and do whatever I want to do. I can move through life with relative ease compared to women of the past — especially those disproportionately impacted by cruelty for being women of color, poor, or both. This freedom was not afforded to them. But I have it, and with it, I must continue the tradition of persistence. How do you make sure the sacrifices of women who came before aren’t in vain? Tangibly support women now. That means decreasing the maternal mortality rate, protecting our trans sisters, ensuring that sex workers are not unfairly criminalized, increasing access to childcare, safeguarding the rights of BGLTQ women, actively practicing intersectionality, closing the racial and gender pay gaps, eliminating racial and gender bias in medicine, protecting voting rights, ensuring women can make their own healthcare decisions, and supporting women of color entrepeneurs, among so many other actions we can take to ensure women now and in the future can live better lives. You care about women? Show up for them. Make space for them.Believe and protect themwhen they’re hurt by systems you’re part of. I want my future daughters’ and granddaughters’ lives to be significantly better than mine; I want them to accomplish more than I ever will. I want them to know that all the women who came before them cared deeply for their ability to lead long, joy-filled lives. I’m sure that the long chain of my female ancestors would have wanted the exact same thing for me. I’m thankful to my mDNA for connecting me through time with so many persistent, steel-willed women. I’m especially grateful for the women themselves, striving amidst darkness so that I — and all the women who will come after me — can have only light.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_25,"In early February, the Washington football team announced theirnewname, the Washington Commanders. In the summer of 2020, they announced that they wereretiringtheir name and logo, afterdecades of criticismthat the name was ananti-indigenous slur. This is only a fraction of racist history of the team, and the National Football League (NFL in which it resides. George Marshall, the founder of the team, reportedlyconspiredwith other owners to bar Black players from the league in 1933. In 1962, whenevery team but Washingtonhad signed a Black player, Marshall finally relented when threatened with a civil rights lawsuit. Marshall was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. The NFL is a league born in racism, which has persisted through modern times. Throughout the years, the league has maintained the status quo and failed to take action when there were opportunities to combat racism and create positive change. For many years, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell consistently supported the team’s predatory owner,Dan Snyder, in the decision to maintain their old name. In 2013, Goodell said that the NFL would continue to ensure that the team represented its “strong tradition and history.” Washington is a storied franchise, but the offensive name never should have been retained because of that. Citing these factors as reasons for upholding offensive traditions and imagery, a la Confederate flag supporters, was incredibly insensitive and racist. More recently, former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores initiated a lawsuit against the NFL and the Broncos, Dolphins and Giants in early Jan. 2022. Heasserted thatthe Broncos and Giants held interviews with him without any intent of hiring him in order to satisfy the NFL’s Rooney Rule, which stipulates that teams must interview at “least one minority candidate” for a head coach or general manager vacancy. Flores’ lawsuit is a reminder that out of 32 teams, none of the league’s majority owners are Black, there are only three Black general managers, and only one Black head coach. In 2021,70.7% of the NFL’s playerswere people of color. The fact that so many of them are severely underrepresented in the league’s leadership positions is a great disservice, as they are the ones who make the league’s existence possible. Flores has also proved that the Rooney Rule has been inadequate, but the NFL has made a substantial change that should increase its success. The NFL instituted a form of affirmative action in 2020 by modifying the Rooney Rule. Teams that hire a minority head coach or executive are given two third-round picks in the two subsequent drafts. By making this change, the NFL is acknowledging that the Rooney Rule has not been effective – perhaps for the reasons that Flores is suing the NFL – but they are taking a good measure to promote diversity in NFL front offices and head coaching positions. It’s unfortunate that owners need to be given such a hefty incentive to hire minority candidates, but it’s a necessary step to take. The NFL is not ruining its competitive integrity, either, as every team is permitted to benefit from this rule change. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback (QB Colin Kaepernick famously knelt during the singing of the national anthem in the 2016 season. Hesaidthat he refused to stand for a “country that oppresses black people and people of color.” After that season, Kaepernick was blackballed by the league’s owners and has been out of the NFL ever since, but NFL players kneeling during the anthem is nowcommonplace. Some may believe that Kaepernick’s rejection by teams around the league was legitimate, but he led his team to a Super Bowl appearance in 2013 and put up relatively impressivestatisticsin his career. The 49ers were 1-10 in games that Kaepernick started in 2016, but he should have been considered as a compelling backup QB option, at least. When quarterbacks arewidely categorizedas “pro-style” or “dual-threat,” it gives the impression that quarterbacks that do not conform to a certain style of play are not suitable for the NFL. Baltimore Ravens QB Lamar Jackson epitomizes thedual-threat play style, but he has been unfairlylabeled as a gimmickthrough much of his career, as if the points that the Ravens’ offense scores are somehow less legitimate or valuable. In comparison, Saints QB Taysom Hill is admittedly more versatile, but he is revered as anoffensive gadget. Why isn’t Lamar Jackson as respected for his outstanding rushing ability as a QB? Goodellspoke onformer NFL player Emmanuel Acho’s podcast, “Uncomfortable Conversations With A Black Man”, and said that he wished that his league had “listened earlier” to why Colin Kaepernick chose to kneel. Fortunately, Goodell recognizes that it’s not just the thought that counts. Actions speak louder than words. To the NFL’s credit, theyhave contributedmore than $180 million to social justice causes since 2017. As Goodell acknowledged, those efforts are well overdue, but there is still a long way to go in terms of addressing and rectifying the NFL’s deeply-rooted issues relating to racism.

wildcat_arizona_2022_43,"Protesters shout in unison during the Pro-DACA protest on Sept. 5, 2017, in front of Old Main. Voters may show their support for undocumented immigrants by voting in favor of Prop 308. The perspectives surrounding immigrants have only become more hateful in the last few years, especially after the presidency of Donald J. Trump. One of the main foundations of Trump’s campaign was built upon anti-immigrant rhetoricclaimingthat, “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best.” He continued with destructive statements like, “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” During this upcoming midterm election cycle, we have the power to help change the narrative of hate that has been hurting immigrants throughout Arizona for so long. We can do so by voting yes on Proposition 308. This will help uplift our migrant communities, while also providing support to youth — the future of Arizona. Voting yes would give DACA recipients — commonly known as “Dreamers” — theabilityto access in-state tuition at every single public university and community college — regardless of their immigration status. Prop 308 would apply to students in Arizona who have graduated from high school and who have gone to an Arizona school for at least two years. Everyone deserves to have access to affordable education and it shouldn’t differ based solely on current immigration standing. “High school graduates who call Arizona their home deserve in-state college tuition. Dreamers, who were brought to the U.S. by their parents, should have the same educational and employment opportunities as any other Arizona student,”Tucson MayorRegina Romero expressed in the 2022 Election Publicity Pamphlet. For Arizona residents, the averageestimated costof tuition at the University of Arizona is $13,200, whereas it’s a staggering $39,000 for non-Arizona residents. Many “Dreamers” have been raised in Arizona and have contributed so much to our community in terms of skills, experiences, diversity, culture and more. The current price Dreamers have to pay is therefore absurd considering the ways in which Arizona has been positively influenced by these students. RELATED:Prop 308: The futures of Arizona DACA college students are on the ballot this November “Currently, 2,000 Undocumented students graduate from Arizona high schools every year,”Carolina Silva, the Executive Director of Scholarships A-Z, stated in the 2022 Election Publicity Pamphlet. However, most undocumented or “Dreamer” students often are, “lacking the institutional support, guidance, and supportive network they deserve,” she continued. Silva is right, “Dreamers” are deserving of a network surrounded by supporting individuals. We are supposed to be an inclusive community for all immigrants in Arizona and throughout the United States. If we want to live up to the values of inclusivity in our college community, we need to vote YES on Prop 308. If you are not registered to vote in Arizona and are eligible clickhereto register. Make sure to vote in the upcoming midterm election cycle on Nov. 8 and watch for Prop 308, so you can say yes!

stanforddaily_2022_56,"Akshay Swaminathan and Wasan Kumarare first year MD candidates. Last year, on a sunny August afternoon, we lined up with our fellow incoming medical students on the Dean’s lawn to receive our white coat and stethoscope. The White Coat Ceremony marks the start of our training as future physicians. Held annually before the beginning of the first quarter, the ceremony is a time for students to celebrate the start of their medical career with friends and family and enjoy a nice meal courtesy of Stanford catering. At our ceremony, however, several of our classmates were unable to celebrate this occasion over dinner with our loved ones. As we approached the food station after the ceremony, we found that there were no dinner options left for vegetarians. Unfortunately, insufficient vegetarian options are not a rare occurrence at Stanford events. Throughout our first year here, we have attended lunch seminars, dinner seminars, orientations, club meetings and other events where the food options for vegetarians were limited or nonexistent. Not only does a lack of vegetarian options mean that our cultural or moral commitments are not recognized, but it also means that we are unable to choose a food option that reduces our impact on the environment. Having spent my Akshay’s entire life on the East Coast, I had never heard of the abbreviation AQI (air quality index until coming to Stanford. During my first few weeks on campus, I found myself googling “Palo Alto AQI” nearly every morning as I saw the smog from forest fires floating over campus. The haze was not very different from the smog I had seen in Beijing during a trip a few years ago. In fact, the AQI in Palo Alto sometimes exceeds that of Beijing,one of the most polluted cities in the world. Stanford is already doing a lot to address climate change, from itselectric shuttle buses, todepartmental carbon emissions goalstoeco-friendly cleaning solutions. Why can’t we adopt a similar environmentally conscious approach when it comes to food? The evidence is clear thatplant-based diets are generally more environmentally friendly than non-vegetarian diets. In fact, the UN IPCC report indicates we could reduce greenhouse emissions by six gigatons a year (or 16.5% of total emissions if everyone reduced their meat intake to once a month, and eight gigatons (or 22% of total emissions if everyone completely stopped eating meat. Plant-based meals are typically cheaper than meat-based meals and would save money for Stanford and its dining services if implemented at scale. Plant-based meals are also more inclusive because non-vegetarians can typically eat vegetarian, but not the other way around. Non-vegetarians may even prefer to eat vegetarian depending on the options available. In fact, at our White Coat Ceremony, the shortage of vegetarian meals happened because non-vegetarians snatched up the limited number of vegetarian meals before the vegetarians could (we don’t blame them — those enchiladas looked good! . Similarly, as the cost and taste of plant-based meat substitutes approaches those of regular meat we hope to ameliorate meat-lovers’ concerns of compromising on the flavors and textures they know and love. There are ways to encourage plant-based dining habits without alienating those who prefer meat-based options.One effective approachis “default vegetarianism,” in which vegetarian meals are the default option and non-vegetarian meals must be explicitly requested. This method opposes the status quo, where vegetarians must specially request a plant-based meal because the default option is typically meat-based. In a default vegetarian world, everyone can eat whatever they want, but folks are nudged toward choosing the more environmentally friendly option. Opt-out strategies, like default vegetarianism, have beensuccessful in diverse settings, including raising organ donation rates, encouraging healthy decision making and even increasing philanthropic donations. This approach is not unheard of at Stanford. Pockets of the Law School, School of Earth Sciences and Business School are vegetarian by default, if not completely vegetarian. There are also theDefaultVeg,AltProteinandOne Plate, One Planetmovements, which aim to encourage sustainable plant-based eating habits across Stanford. As we expand access to plant-based meals, the quality of Stanford catering’s vegetarian meals will only improve. Food sustainability is a complex and nuanced issue. A rigorous approach to sustainable food practices may consider whether or not food is locally sourced, what type of farm produces the food, how far the food travels from where it was produced to Stanford, etc. We must be thoughtful about how we encourage climate-conscious food, but there are steps in the right direction that we can take immediately. Whilenot all plant-based foods have a low climate footprint, it is clear that on average, plant-based diets aremore environmentally friendlythan animal-based diets. Stanford can continue to strive for a campus environment that is sustainable, inclusive and tasty for all students by learning from those in our community who are already taking a thoughtful approach to sustainable food practices. As medical school acceptances were released earlier this month, we hope that the incoming class of students can look forward to a delicious plant-based meal to share with their friends and family at the next White Coat Ceremony.

thetech_mit_2022_9,"I enjoyed my first nine months in my lab without incident — I got along with my PI and was nearing completion on a body of work that would result in a first-author publication. But one October evening, things changed. My PI sent an email accusing me of breaking equipment that I hadn’t touched in weeks. When I tried to defend myself, she called me “combative” and called my communication style “unprofessional.” She told me that I was a bad lab citizen, even though as lab safety officer I devoted hours every week to managing lab waste and keeping my labmates safe. My PI made several unreasonable demands in the following weeks, including that we work at least 60 hours per week and respond to Slack messages within one hour during the workday, a rule that completely disregards the fact that students have classes and experiments that prohibit swift responses at all times. When I tried to communicate my concerns, I was again accused of “giving pushback” and being disrespectful. To resolve our “communication issues,” my PI set up a meeting mediated by a “neutral” third party from the Office of Graduate Education (OGE . Unfortunately, the mediator had already talked to my PI and was biased in favor of her perspective. The mediator tried to frame the situation as if I were an obstinate student who did not respect authority, when the reality was that I was communicating realistic work expectations and advocating for myself in a healthy way. I understand healthy communication because I spent two years at a biotech company under several different managing scientists. My managers confirmed that my communication style was professional and often solicited feedback from me. I was shocked to find that here at MIT, healthy dialogue was apparently unacceptable: the “resolution” of the mediated meeting was that I would obey my PI without communicating concerns or offering feedback. I felt silenced and powerless. My relationship with my PI continued to deteriorate, and eventually I decided that it was time to find a healthier lab environment. I could no longer even discuss science critically without being told I was disrespectful, making it impossible for me to grow as a scientist. I negotiated the process of transitioning labs over several meetings with my PI and another faculty member. Judging from the experiences of others in my department, I expected to wrap up and leave in two weeks. However, my PI demanded that I stay until I completed a long list of tasks and refused to commit to a concrete deadline until the faculty mediator intervened. They decided I would stay for six weeks. Unfortunately, I had already set up a rotation in the lab I wanted to join. For six weeks I worked in two labs at once, often staying until 10 or 11 p.m. to finish my experiments. I was physically exhausted and frequently felt depressed. Adding to my distress, my PI cut me out of the writing process for the paper based on my work. We had a mediated meeting to negotiate authorship, but it turned out not to be a negotiation at all. My PI declared that I would be the third author, after the postdoc who would finish the experiments and another postdoc who had performed a single preliminary experiment. I responded that I felt this was unfair, given that I had engineered the strains, developed the assays, and obtained the key results. Furthermore, I was on good terms with the postdoc who was to finish the work, and she agreed that it would be fair to do a co-first authorship. Nevertheless, the conclusion of the meeting was that my PI would have complete control over authorship. My experiences with MIT’s current processes for conflict resolution and lab transition were strongly negative: I was powerless to resolve the conflict with my PI and I struggled to advocate for myself during the transition period. I support unionization and signed my union card becauseI believe our union is essential for correcting the systemic power imbalance between students and PIs. The current avenues available for students to resolve advisor conflicts are woefully inadequate. Students can resolve issues one-on-one with their advisors, or they can have meetings mediated by “neutral” mediators from OGE or Ombuds or by another faculty member. In cases involving harassment or discrimination, conflicts can be reported to the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office. However, all of these “neutral” entities areadministered by MIT and are thus incentivized to prioritize the interests of the institution over the interests of individual graduate students. As a result, exploitative and abusive PIs remain in their positions with no incentive to change their behavior, while students are treated as dispensable and may need toswitch labsor evendrop out of their programto escape toxic situations. Unionization will change this paradigm by introducing a more student-oriented grievance procedure to resolve conflicts with PIs. We can win a union contract that contains protections regarding work expectations, harassment and discrimination, and retaliation concerns. If a PI violates our contract, we can file an official grievance. For example, I could have filed a grievance about my PI’s 60-hour workweek demand. Once a grievance is filed, mediation meetings can be used to resolve the conflict. If desired, a union representative (UR can be present at these meetings to advocate exclusively for the student’s interests and provide support. I believe that the meetings about my advisor conflict and lab transition would have been more positive and resulted in fairer outcomes if a UR had been at my side. In the case that the grievance cannot be resolved through mediation, it can be brought to a truly neutral third-party arbiter. Excitingly,Columbia’s graduate student union recently wonthe right to neutral, third-party arbitration in cases involving harassment and discrimination. In addition to flawed conflict resolution processes, transitioning labs is a messy process that leaves students vulnerable to exploitation by PIs. Recently, theRISE campaignwon new guidelines around lab transitions includingguaranteed transitional fundingand time limits on wrap-up and hand-off duties. Transitional funding decreases the power that a PI holds over a student; I received transitional funding, and it is hard to express the magnitude of relief this gave me. Unfortunately, MIT can revoke these protections at any time. Our union can guarantee that we keep these protections by including them in a contract and can extend these protections to students who choose to switch labs for reasons other than an unhealthy advising relationship. Graduate students and PIs share a common goal of producing top-tier research. Currently, the processes for resolving disputes are one-sided and do not promote fair or cooperative resolution. A union grievance process is negotiated and agreed upon by both parties — graduate student workers and supervisors — and ultimately ratified by graduate students as a part of our contract. Fair conflict resolution is essential for a healthy workplace, and every student deserves a lab environment where they can learn and reach their full potential. Help win a fair grievance procedure bysigning your union cardand voting yes to form our union.

wildcat_arizona_2022_14,"Constant attention, gifts, flowers, sweet texts and phone calls. Are these sweet gestures from a potential partner or are you a victim of love bombing? Love bombing means “bombing” another person with constant affection, attention and gifts. The romance that seems as if it is straight out of a movie feels almost too good to be true. An article byPsychology Todayputs it best, “Love bombing is an attempt to influence another person with over-the-top displays of attention and affection. We’re not just talking about romantic gestures, like flowers and trips. Love bombing invariably includes lots of romantic conversation, long talks about ‘our future,’ and long periods of staring into each other’s eyes.” Most of us can admit that we like to feel special and wanted by others. Attention and validation is something that many of us crave. This is why it’s easy to fall into the trap of love bombing. The constant attention and romantic gestures make us feel important, special, and wanted. We may even think that we have found “the one.” Psychology Today goes on to explain why love bombing is such a successful tactic in relationships, “Love bombing works because humans have a natural need to feel good about who we are, and often we can’t fill this need on our own.” RELATED:OPINION: Say it to my face: The problems with ghosting A few examples of love bombing could include: long love letters, bouquets and flowers being sent to your home, going on elaborate dates and trips, showering you with compliments and making unrealistic promises about the future. Love bombers might use phrase such as: “I know we just met, but we could be perfect together.” “I’ve never met anyone like you.” “It’s going to be you and me forever.” “We have something special.” These phrases and gestures may sound sweet and like they are right out of a fairy tale, but they can be problematic if said early on in the relationship or in the talking stage. The problem with love bombing is that it can be thought of as a trap or as a manipulative way to draw another person into a relationship where the love bomber has the control and power. To a love bomber, love is like a game that they want to be in control of and love bombing doesn’t last long. As soon as the other person begins to reciprocate the attention and affection back, the love bomber slowly begins to take it all back and fades away from their life. When we experience the fairy tale love in the beginning, we can become addicted and obsessed with the way that it made us feel. When the love bomber begins to fade away, we miss the excitement and attention that they were once constantly giving us. The bottom line is, healthy relationships don’t begin with an “I love you” and dozens of roses on the first or second date. Being love bombed is not true love; it’s a form of manipulation and a “love” that won’t last long. Follow Julianna Strano onTwitter Julianna is a senior majoring in journalism and sociology.

ubyssey_2022_32,"April 4, 2022 Written bySamuel Wallace AfterMatt Taibbi’s talk with the Phil Lind Initiativeon government overreach under Trump was postponed until April, the added time left me to ponder an appropriate pairing for his topic: the stringent COVID-19 guidelines we have learned to live under to the point of isolation becoming second nature. I write at a time whenlockdown measures are ending, and the need to “live with” COVID-19 through vaccination efforts is now theprevailing message from public health experts. The mask mandate has been lifted provincially.Vaccine passports have been argued against— with good reason — which has led to the government announcing their end on April 8. Meanwhile, UBC lags behind. It is only the vaccine declaration and rapid-testing programs, two rules that were controversial from the beginning, that have finally been recognized by the university as now beinguseless. Masks, by their very nature, remain the most extreme measure still being enforced. By obscuring the face, they neglect identity. By favouring the health of the mass collective, they disregard the choice of the individual. This presents a conflict for UBC admin. Is university not a place to grow as an individual, as our singular-form motto Tuum Est — “it is yours” — indicates? Therefusal to lift this restrictive mandatesuggests otherwise. No amount of emails from the AMS promoting mental health awareness are able to negate the effects masks have on student wellbeing. Their problems are elevated in the lecture halls. University is a place to make the long-lasting connections with educators and peers we crave as social animals. How exactly is one supposed to thrive when a horizontal piece of fabric — or in the case of the N95, a conic appearance not unlike a literal muzzle — remains the most immediate superficial barrier? They only further the societal drift towards convenient antisociality. And as Vancouver Coastal Healthhas stated in a letter to UBC, extreme measures such as these may in fact be the ultimate blockade to student happiness. By continuing the mask mandate, the university admin have been bucked off their proverbial high horse. We can no longer claim to be “doing our part”; we are no longer “saving lives,” among other trivial phrases used to emotionally manipulate us into following unreasonable rules. These are not only my opinions, but those of thegovernment and public health expertsUBC once followed. Our university can therefore no longer claim to be following the science. In the end, university staff are impacting student well-being and mental health in favour of projecting a false sense of compassion. And we’re still wearing masks asothers in the western worldcelebrate being free — we remain prisoners of our own heightened sense of virtuosity. Although a spike in BA.2 cases has prompted fears of a return to enforced masking, Dr. Bonnie Henry has definitively statedthe goal amid COVID-19 is to never need a mask mandate again.Our university can therefore no longer claim to be following the provincial science. The university admin who prevent us fully connecting after two years of division should be questioned by the tuition-paying students that provide them with power in the first place. Moreover, any government leaders who want to goagainst the scienceand postpone our renaissance following two years of pent-up energy should be questioned by the people who form their democracy. Otherwise, enter the never-ending days of mistrusting those beside you; of further isolation and presuming wrongdoing when someone strays from the flock.

crimson_2022_157,"I came home from work one day in July to some alarming news: A gunman had opened fire and killed three people at Ateneo de Manila University, my parents’ alma mater and one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the Philippines. According to police, the suspect had along-running feudwith one of his victims, an Ateneo parent and the former mayor of Lamitan, the suspect’s town. The dispute began in 2019, when the suspect’s unlicensed medical practice was shut down by the regional government. He blamed the mayor,publicly accusing herof corruption and drug trafficking — grave and highly political charges in the Philippines, where thousands of extrajudicial killings have taken place in recent years as part of former President Rodrigo Duterte’s blood-soakedwar on drugs. In short order, my thoughts drifted from my parents’ college to my own future alma mater. Like at Ateneo, many spaces on Harvard’s campus can be accessed by unauthorized persons with relative ease. Just last semester, a team of YouTuberssnuck into at least two large lecture hallsand would likely have gone unnoticed if not for the disruptive prank video they were filming. Surely, actors with less benign intentions could do worse. But this op-ed is not about the security of Harvard’s campus. It is about how, at a university separated by thousands of miles but just a generation’s difference from where my parents studied, I am spared from encountering similar extrajudicial killings while pursuing my education — it is about, in other words, the privilege of security that comes with living in America. Admittedly, American cities don’t exactly scream “security,” especially not at night, andespecially not at night for women, and especially not at night for women who live in states where abortion has been banned or will be banned imminently. And neither does the southern border, where migrants sometimesdie of heat exhaustionin sweltering tractor-trailers because of a legal migration system so dysfunctional that smuggling humans is, in some sense, the safest option. What I mean to say is: Yes, there may be millions of Americans who have to live every day knowing that their lives could be taken away by a guy with a gun, for no reason other than the place they grew up, the color of their skin, or the clothes they wear, for no reason other than being at the wrong place at the wrong time, for absolutely no reason at all — but at least if I die in America, it won’t be because my neighbor thought I was on drugs and shot me dead because the president told him to. Gratitude is a tricky concept to navigate. There are times when I look around at what’s going on in this country — the Supreme Court poised tostrike down affirmative action, hundreds of elected Republican officialsrefusing to accept electoral defeat, state governorsshipping immigrants aroundwith no prior arrangements for housing or jobs — and decide I want no part of it. It is also during these times that I am most acutely aware of the privilege this nation has given me. Because I was born in America, I have the luxury to choose whether I stay or leave. And, regardless of my choice, I have the luxury of living in a safe place. I have these privileges only because my parents made sacrifices to raise me in the kind of city that allows one to end up at Harvard. So I don’t know if I can look around at what’s going on in this country and still say that I like it here, but I also don’t know if I can look my parents in the eye and tell them that I don’t. Like my own feelings, America’s politics of gratitude is deeply confused: about what gratitude actually looks like, what we should be grateful for, and to whom our gratitude is owed. Today, one is marked ungrateful (read: “anti-American” for pointing out the ills of America’s institutions or holding opinions that diverge from red-white-and-blue tradition. But to defend tradition for tradition’s sake because of some unexamined belief in America’s greatness is empty gratitude. We cannot claim to be grateful for the genuine achievements of this country while censuring those who seek no more than to hold America to its highest ideals. True gratitude requires honesty, a willingness to confront the moments when America, though good, has failed to be great. As a first-generation immigrant, I think the only tenable stance I can take is one of heavy, intense, and crushing gratitude. I find myself pinned under the weight of words like “If you don’t like it here, then leave,” pinned under the weight of dead bodies in the Philippines, pinned under the weight of the sacrifices my parents made so that our family could live here, pinned under the weight of the fact that this is all I have ever known. Don’t think for a second that my yearning for change comes from a place of ingratitude. As confusing and painful as it can be to think about sometimes, I am grateful to be an American. That gratitude — firmly rooted in the hope that this country can be great — is why we should all want America to become better. Francis Immanuel N.

stanforddaily_2022_109,"When I finally had my first big-girl engineering job, the paltry number of immediate colleagues who looked like me was a huge culture shock. As a student, I haven’t been in industry long enough to experience the effects of the perpetual recurrence of these feelings, but by the end of three months, I had drawn my own conclusions. If I wanted to have a long, shining, successful career in this field, I needed to know my role models, mentors and about acceptable work culture (at least in my immediate team . I also needed to solidify my motivations and confidence in the field, and in myself, in order to survive the barriers produced by this gender disparity. Women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math fields have long been subjected to sexism in the workplace. They facestereotyping, harassment, opportunity gaps, derogatory commentsand arepaid less, promoted less and given less access to work opportunities. Despite womenearning35.1% of undergraduate degrees and 34.5% of Ph.D. STEM degrees between 2008–2015, the drop to27%for female STEM workers and5%for females in top executive positions isn’t entirely shocking. Several measures can be taken to improve the work environment for women. A 2016studypublished in the Harvard Business Review found that in a hiring pool of four candidates, increasing the number of female or minority candidates from one to two significantly increased their chances of being hired. Specifically, they found that the likelihood of a woman getting hired was 50% in a candidate pool of two men and two women, but dropped to 0% in a candidate pool of three men and one woman. Thus, implementing gender-blind hiring policies could help women overcome the barriers of these types of biases. Furthermore, even though 50% of American jobs are performed by women, women make up only6.6%of Fortune 500 CEOs. To address the bias that has led to this statistic, companies can implement directed programs providing training, mentorship and exposure to leadership opportunities for women, with clear articulations such as end-goals of promoting participants to senior managerial roles or C-suite positions. Nevertheless, women face additional difficulties outside of the workplace. For example, having a family disproportionately affects women: 57% of new mothers work full-timecomparedto 78% of new fathers. At the same time, the U.S. is the onlynationamong the 36 member-nations of OECD that does not have a government-mandated maternity leave. Mandating these policies can give women equal decision-making opportunities when considering starting a family. But uniformity in paid maternity leave doesn’t resolve consequences at the workplace for women after they have children — the current reality that mothers do the majority of child-rearing pulls women out of the race early on and prevents them from accessing work-related opportunities, such as promotion. The longer a woman’s maternity leave, the less likely she is to be viewed as equal to men for salary raises or promotions. Policies such as mandated paternity leave can help combat this bias. These are only a few examples of the biases women face at work that have the potential to influence their growth opportunities; both the federal government and private corporations can continue to addressother biaseswomen face, starting with implementing more — and more nuanced — policies. A prominent policy that has surfaced recently is pay transparency. There is no doubt that this move would quickly display the very real way in which women in STEM face unfair treatment. Companies can now close pay gaps and women can better advocate for themselves, instead of relying on beinganonymously informedof this discrimination once the opportunity for negotiation is over. One such example is theNYC wage transparency law, which was passed by the New York City Council in December 2021 and goes into effect in May 2022. Opponentsarguethat this transparency could lead employers to retain fewer employees (due to decreased ability to pay talented staffers lower rates , and that it could have detrimental effects on employees due to salary tensions and the possibility that employees will take pay differences out of context. Ultimately, how a company treats these considerations will hugely reflect how serious they are about their company culture, especially when it has the potential to affect the company’s business model. Yet, in order to keep female professionals in STEM, a similar or modified policy should be considered. In addition to implementation, better publicization of these policies can help shape workplace culture, allowing women to feel more accepted. Changes can include collecting and publishing statistics at the end of a performance cycle, reinforcement of company DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals byhigher managementand regular communication about these initiatives and culture amongst teams. Mandated sex-disaggregated data in areas such as pay, new hires and promotions canbothincrease gender diversity awareness amongst employees and drive better policy decisions. In 2019,97.3%of venture capital (VC funding went to male-founded companies. Publishing gender-disaggregated data on funding within VC firms can help bring awareness to their investment choices.Leader inclusiveness, which refers to “words and behaviors displayed by leaders that encourage others’ involvement and appreciate others’ contributions,” is another strategy that can help employees feel that it issafeto express their concerns, especially since “a lot of companies are early in diversity, equity and inclusion,”accordingto DEI consultant Melinda B. Epler. Personally, leaders who embody these initiatives weigh largely when I assess my work experience. At my previous company, my manager made it extremely clear to me that it was important for me to report anything I felt uncomfortable with, after I once skirted around a description of unfair treatment. Later on, one of my teammates told me that, in the past, my manager had asked HR to be more mindful of the candidates they sent over for interviews after noticing the homogeneous resumes he came across during interviews. Although I never personally asked my manager about this, I became much more trusting of the fact that my manager really could serve as my advocate after hearing about his emphasis on promoting diversity. While these are all important action items, we must be cognizant ofhowthis work is being executed — and, more importantly,whois doing the executing. Efforts towards implementing these standards should be shared equally, yet this work has fallendisproportionatelyon women. In academia, the unrecognized work performed by underrepresented faculty members has been termed “invisible labor.” Based onsurvey responsesby 469 faculty members, a significant number of individuals who claimed to engage in DEI work self-identified as non-white, non-male or first-generation college attendees. By publishing gender-disaggregated data on who is attending or organizing DEI workshops and committees and engaging in diversity-focused recruitment and peer-reviewed work, among other initiatives, we can help close the gap of this unequal burden and perhaps change the culture in which most underrepresented individuals feel that theyvaluediversity work more than their peers. We can certainly make significant improvements to the work environment for women. By retaining the amount of women who enter junior-level STEM roles, and eventually increasing the percentage of women in senior roles, we can start a cycle of increasing the number of women in STEM. With the increase in the number of female role models, younger girls with STEM interests will have a better chance at achieving their future career goals.

state_press_2022_22,"Social media, and more specifically TikTok, has a huge influence on Generation Z and how people in Gen Z live their life. Over the past few years,TikTokhas exploded and grown to be one of the most popular apps among young people in the United States. As TikTok has grown in such a short period of time, many universities around the country have taken advantage of its popularity and created official TikTok accounts and pages. However, ASU is not one of those schools. Universities like theUniversity of California, Los Angeles, andUAboth have official TikTok accounts that show what the campus is like in creative ways and what student life is like when class is in session. Many schools already have TikTok accounts for their athletic departments and even for some specific sports. ASU does not have anathletic TikTok, something increasingly common for both collegiate and professional programs to have. ASU needs to develop an official account because it can help with the recruitment of students when high schoolers are applying to universities. According toStatista, 25% of all TikTok users in the U.S. are between 10-19 years old. Social media, and more specifically TikTok, has a huge influence on Generation Z and how they live their life. According to a Gen Z marketing consultant quoted inForbes, Generation Z understands that social media is like a highlight reel, and we choose to show what we feel best about. It s less about insecurity and more about being a self-confidence booster. With a statistic like this, the development of an official account can only benefit the school. By reaching the younger demographic where it is already spending time online, it gives the University an edge over other schools that students are applying to because it gives the administration the edge in social media and in therecruitment of future students. ASU also is a verydiverse universityand shows prospective students who might be coming from a different country. Having TikTok will allow these students to feel welcomed into the ASU community. “ASU should have an official TikTok account because I feel it would show how diverse the culture is and give an inside look into what being a college student at ASU looks like,” said sophomore nursing student Kylie Aube. Having strong social media can only help ASU with recruiting prospective students throughout the country and the world and helping students engage in new ways that have never been seen before. For example, ASU could give a short explanation on how it stands out compared to other schools in the country simply by making a three-minute post on TikTok. Using TikTok will create a new audience for the University and will allow current students to have fun with school officials and create a fun, learning environment that can be posted for all to see. For a university that prides itself in being No. 1 in innovation for seven straight years, it only makes sense that it needs to hop on the trend of creating a TikTok account.

stanforddaily_2022_96,"When I enter a room, my disability is always one step ahead of me. My powered wheelchair gives me nowhere to hide from the palpable intrigue hanging in the air, and I have perfected a sweet smile in response to the eyes that inevitably drift my way as I pass by. I tell myself it must be my cute outfit, but the reality is that having a highly visible disability defines my interpersonal life and is a lens through which I interact with the world around me. I exist at the intersection of society’s deeply embedded stereotypes about disability, my own internalized ableism and my identity aside from my diagnosis of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA — but the visibility of my disability means that the latter is forever framed by my four wheels. It might be nice to just once introduce myself without SMA as my plus-one, but for the most part my interactions are extremely positive. Rarely do I make it from my dorm to class without at least five strangers offering to assist in some way, and my needs are so apparent that many feel compelled to go out of their way to provide access and accommodations across academic and social spaces. Whether it’s constructing a makeshift ramp or allowing me to use my laptop in a technology-free class, I sense a general eagerness at the individual level to relieve the burdens of my day. Expanding into broader disability advocacy at Stanford, however, I learned that my personal experience is far from the norm. For every professor that pulls me aside to inquire what more they can do to support me beyond my prescribed accommodations, there are students with invisible disabilities and fluctuating chronic illnesses fighting the same battles over and over to receive the bare minimum they require to participate in their education. Where people have been known to quite literally remove a door to grant me access, others are interrogated at that very same door and subjected to the emotional toll of repeatedly justifying their needs, simply because they are not visible to the naked eye. Society’s understanding — and, to some extent, acceptance — of disability remains so rooted in its physical manifestation on the body that any experience of disability falling short of this expectation is deemed invalid. This is not about one form of disability being preferable to the other — rather, this is an observation on how strides made in accessibility that appear concrete and praiseworthy on the surface continue to exclude such a significant portion of the disability community. Those with physical disabilities are by no means exempt from ableist aggressions in the classroom and beyond, and it is definitely true that the degree to which a disability is deemed visually and socially “acceptable” plays a significant role. Other aspects of identity also contribute in important ways, and it is often at these points of intersection that the most severe harm is experienced. At the core, however, I intend to acknowledge that there is privilege in the visibility of my disability. While we are visually inseparable, this overt representation of my needs means that I am rarely required to offer explanation or justification for my situation. In the academic context, the way I show up to class matches up with the recommendations of my OAE letter, and subsequently my needs are almost always met without resistance. Behind every disability there is a hidden story that even a wheelchair cannot fully tell, but at least in my case its presence provides enough information that most are willing to accept my word and embrace the needs with which I present. In contrast, a “non-disabled” appearance has evolved into both a twisted compliment and cutting accusation entangled with a distinct narrow-mindedness and the severely misguided notion that the exaggeration of impairment would somehow be worth society’s “perks.” In a life already defined by obstacles, the task of dissecting and revealing intimate details about the unseen reality of one’s lived experience with disability can be deeply traumatizing. Yet in most circumstances, this all could be avoided through a simple willingness to put faith in both the individual and, in the case of the OAE, the process into which they already poured energy and vulnerability to have this lived experience confirmed in black and white. As Stanford enters a new phase of reimagining disability on our campus with the recentopening of the Disability Community Spaceand other initiatives to tackle institutional barriers, it must be a priority to ensure that all community members feel empowered to request the support they need to thrive and can expect fair treatment in the provisions thereof, regardless of how their particular disability manifests. The burden of proving the legitimacy of disability must be eliminated through increased awareness and inclusive policy, and we remain focused on defining accessibility in terms that are not limited by the assumption that seeing is believing. Tilly Griffiths ‘22 is a senior from the United Kingdom pursuing a double-major in Political Science and Communication. As a person with disabilities herself and current ASSU Director of Disability Advocacy, she has written extensively for the Daily on issues relating to accessibility and inclusion since her freshman year, and continues to highlight the experiences of the disability community on campus as an opinion columnist"
rice_thresher_2022_56,"2/22/22 11:27pm Student media advisor Kelley Lash passed away Monday Feb. 21. She will be dearly missed by many, including current students and alumni. Many people see student media and think the students are running the show – the reality is, none of it would have been possible without Kelley. Kelley remembered things that other people didn’t. She was never afraid to tell it exactly how it is, to both students and administrators alike. Kelley would deliver a blisteringly honest critique with a smile and some freshly baked cupcakes, because she cared so, so, so much. And she never stopped caring, even as students graduated and budgets got squeezed and years passed. It’s incredible to see the number of people she impacted. I will miss her dearly. – Christina Tan, Duncan ’20, Thresher EIC 2019-2020 Kelley s office always had an open door; full of comic book figurines and bobbleheads, her office was a safe haven I d stop by almost every day for three years. There, she laughed, listened, and shared her love for journalism and her students. Kelley inspired me and empowered me, and believed in me when I didn t. She s the reason I joined the Thresher and became editor-in-chief. She truly changed my life. The memory of her advice, her hugs, her motivation and her friendship will always comfort me. – Juan Saldaña, Will Rice ’18, Thresher EIC 2017-2018 Kelley was a friend and a mentor, not only when I was working at the paper but even years later when I returned to Houston. She never told us directly to do something, but we were always better off following her advice. Even when we screwed something up, she never lost her sense of humor and perspective; I hope that s just one of the things I ve learned from her. Every time I stopped by her office, she was happy to catch up and check how I d been. I wish I could stop by one more time. – Seth Brown, Jones ’13, Thresher EIC 2012-2013 Kelley was outstanding at running student media. But what made her so special was her love for the students she supported. Like the best teachers, she was honest when she knew we could do better and overcome with pride when we achieved something great. And like a best friend, she could make us laugh even on our worst days. I’ll never forget her relentless support for me through all my successes and failures at Rice, not just as a mentor, but as a friend. – Andrew Grottkau, McMurtry ’19, Thresher EIC 2018-2019 Kelley was always telling us how proud of us she was. The power of that support buoyed me through my years at Rice and as I began a career in journalism. I felt so much braver because I knew I had Kelley on my side, because she pushed me when I was being complacent and went easy on me when I needed a break. Having someone like Kelley in our lives, someone who was proud of you, fiercely protective of you, who believed in you before you even felt you deserved that belief - clearly shaped so many young lives. – Anna Ta, Will Rice ’20, Thresher Managing Editor 2019-2020 Kelley was KTRU’s biggest fan and advocate because she deeply valued how the station was run and cared for by DJs for years. She shared in our laughter, anger, excitement and fears. Far beyond what a club advisor is expected to do, Kelley took on the responsibility of cultivating a space where we could feel safe, respected and supported. It was so meaningful to have someone believe in me, us and the station. I miss her and she had a huge impact on my life. – Kaarthika Thakker, Lovett ’20, KTRU SM 2019-2020 Kelley was one of the first Rice faculty members to hug me when I arrived on campus as a bewildered freshman, and she was most definitely the last to hug me when I departed campus as an edging-on-adult-status graduate. There were about a thousand hugs in between — she was the best support during some of my hardest moments at Rice, and the biggest champion of my triumphs. She taught her students about so much: the balance of truth and morality in our complicated world, the importance of standing up for yourself and your skills, the value of kindness and empathy. She didn t just teach me about media and journalism; she helped me realize the person I wanted to be. – Rachel Marcus, McMurtry ’14, Thresher EIC 2013-2014 Kelley was a staunch advocate for a free press and helped that principle come to life in the student newspaper. She allowed staff the resources to do great work, and even ensured the lowly Backpage had its place on the paper’s rear end. Other students may not know Kelley’s name because she didn’t have a weekly byline, but her fingerprints cover every issue of the paper that was published under her watch. The entire student body is indebted to her work as much as the Thresher staff. – Isaac Schultz, Duncan ’18, Thresher Backpage Editor 2017-2018 Kelley made an immeasurable impact on my life. When I received an offer for my dream job in journalism, she was my first call — mostly because I knew it never would have been possible without her guidance and encouragement years earlier. Kelley taught me to trust my instincts as an inexperienced sophomore who had just been handed the keys to the Thresher. She always seemed to have the perfect words of advice. Her support never wavered, and her abundant kindness helped me through many difficult periods. The most remarkable thing about Kelley: My experience was hardly unique. Kelley impacted the lives of so many student journalists at Rice, and we are all richer for it. – Miles Kruppa, Hanszen ’16, Thresher EIC 2014-2015 Journalists are superheroes, and Kelley was the prime example. Always seeking truth, justice and the American way, Kelley was a fierce advocate for her students and others. Even when my paths led away from journalism, Kelley stayed by my side, always lending a supportive ear and a tight hug—a true mentor and a wonderful friend. Thank you for making Rice Student Media a family for all of us; you will be dearly missed. – Anastasia “Anya” Bolshakov, Duncan ’15, Campanile EIC 2013-2015 Kelley shaped so many lives on campus. To say she was passionate about student media and her students is an understatement. She was dedicated, kind, encouraging and knew how to give tough love when needed. As the director of student media and a McMurtry resident associate, she always made time to connect with students, whether they were in student media or not. My favorite memories with Kelley are all of the conversations we’d have about life, journalism, J.J. Watt, and so many other topics when I’d pop into her office at the RMC. Kelley was one of the people who most shaped me into the writer and person I am today. I carry her career and life advice with me every day — and so many other Rice students and alumni can say the same. – Tina Nazerian, McMurtry ’16, Thresher Asst News Editor August-December 2014 Kelley’s calming presence made problems, no matter how big, feel manageable. Her office was a safe haven where her students could escape the stresses of life and confide in an advisor who supported them with her whole heart. Kelley made me feel my dreams are possible, and I hope to live life like she did, full of love, passion and joy. – Emily Abdow, Jones ’19, Thresher EIC 2018-2019 During my time at KTRU, the leadership team faced many intense challenges. When times were at their most stressful, we could depend on Kelley to be a clear-headed and caring guide. In every interaction with Kelley we could feel that she cared deeply for the station and for us, our well-being, and our learning. We felt seen. She helped us to grow into more thoughtful and deliberate leaders by advice and by example. We will carry those lessons always. – George Barrow, Sid Richardson ’18, KTRU SM 2017-2018 Without a formal journalism program at Rice, we all turned to Kelley — for guidance, for support, for laughter, for fresh baked goods. We sat day in and day out in the Thresher office knowing that Kelley was always nearby to offer advice. She made all of us feel seen in our endeavors, pushed us to pursue hard truths, empowered us to know the impact we had as a collective, fought fiercely to ensure we all had a voice and celebrated us any chance she had. Her presence uplifted all of us, and her impact will not be forgotten. – Tina Liu, Sid Richardson ’20, Thresher Art Director 2019-2020 When asked about college, I always discussed the Thresher and its incredible advisor. Kelley was the highlight of my time at Rice. At her office atop the stairs, she d always invite me in, share a fresh cupcake and genuinely listen. She taught me patience, persistence and the value of journalism. One could not ask for a better mentor. Her guidance frequently comes to mind years after graduation, and her memory will forever be an inspiration. – Andrew Ta, Jones ’16, Thresher EIC 2015-2016 When I think of Kelley, I think of warmth — a sunny office, a genuine smile and quick laugh, a ready hug. It was impossible to interact with Kelley and not be struck by her deep care for her family and her students. Kelley’s discerning critiques greatly bettered the Thresher as a publication; her compassion and love bettered the lives of all of us involved with it. – Drew Keller, Brown ’18, Thresher EIC 2017-2018 Like most Thresher alumni, the defining experience of my college career wasn’t the hours I spent in class — it was the time I spent hunkered down in the Thresher office, surrounded by friends, working toward a common goal. It’s hard to imagine any of that getting done without Kelley. One of the kindest and most genuine people I’ve ever met, Kelley was the central figure of the Thresher, and I truly can’t imagine it without her. Even though it’s hard not to feel the immense loss of her presence, it’s a wonderful tribute to see how many students and alumni will always value the role she has played in our lives. – Ivanka Perez, Brown ’21, Thresher EIC 2020-2021 Kelley was the momma bear the Thresher always needed, lending a guiding hand to a pretty rag-tag group of underfunded college kids. She would distribute weekly critiques of our paper, and I would always go through her words with a fine-tooth comb — if she was proud of something you did, that was next level. Kelley was always there for me, and I’ve cried in her office more than once. She was a kind soul, and she had the most comforting hugs. I’m really going to miss having her around. – Sydney Garrett, McMurtry ’19, Thresher Art Director 2018-2019 Kelley was the spirit of the Thresher in so many ways. She was full of warmth and welcome to every new face who joined the staff, always ready to offer advice or listen to you rant. She encouraged us, supported us, and told it to us straight — she was more than we could have ever asked for. – Biz Rasich, Lovett ’20, Thresher Features Editor 2017-2019 Kelley truly was the rock of the Thresher. She was our biggest cheerleader and our most incisive critic, always challenging us to produce the highest level of journalism we could. She cared deeply about each and every person in student media and was always ready with a hug, a funny story, or a word of support. I remember returning to the practically empty office for the first production night for almost a year since COVID, wary of the eerie quiet and the strange new spread-out workspaces. Then I saw Kelley waving from her office and was pointed to a freshly baked batch of cupcakes in the student lounge; all of a sudden, the Thresher office felt like home again. In so many ways, she was the soul of student media, and we will all miss her dearly. – Amy Qin, Baker ’21, Thresher Managing Editor 2020-2021 Kelley always had the brightest smile on her face when I saw her. Even though I wasn’t a constant presence in the Thresher or Campanile offices, she always made me feel welcome. She was also one of my O-Week associates and helped smooth the transition into college. Kelley allowed me to grow as a photographer and gave me the push I needed to pursue new opportunities. I will always remember the trips to New Orleans and New York for the Student Media Conventions and how she encouraged me to come despite the fact that I was just a photographer. I will miss her dearly but will keep all of the good memories in my heart. – Sean Chu, McMurtry ’17, Thresher Head Sports Photographer 2016-2017 Kelley was the best of what Rice has to offer. She made her students feel confident, empowered, and loved. She fought for us and protected us, and she pushed us to do better. When I felt lost after graduating, I showed up to her office for mentorship and comfort as I had so many times before. She changed my life, and the lives of so many others. She will be missed dearly. – Anita Alem, Martel ’17, Thresher Managing Editor 2016-2017 Kelley was the heart and soul of the Thresher. As eager student-journalists who were navigating complex circumstances, we made mistakes. But Kelley always had our back. She turned those occurrences into opportunities for growth and leadership. She brought out the best in me when I was tested as a new editor, and was someone who I could call a friend and trusted mentor. From her famous cupcakes and warm hugs to her selfless service well beyond work hours, Kelley taught us what kindness and compassion looked like. I will dearly miss her, but the love and light that Kelley exuded will continue to fill all those she touched. – Rishab Ramapriyan, Will Rice ’21, Thresher EIC 2020-2021 Kelley was my first true mentor at Rice. I first came to her office for advice as an inexperienced sophomore editor, unsure if she even knew my name. I left the same way I felt after every subsequent meeting with Kelley: supported, heard and deeply grateful. We valued her insights, and she took us seriously, whether we felt like we deserved it or not. Every interaction with Kelley made us better — as writers, as colleagues and as people. – Andrew Ligeralde, Jones ’18, Thresher Asst News Editor 2015-2016 I’ll never forget Kelley’s wisdom and unwavering kindness. She always had the best advice and treated us students journalists with respect in a way that encouraged us to learn and grow. She taught us to ask tough questions, handle sensitive stories with kindness and stand up for what we believed in. Her office was always a welcoming space where I’d plop myself on the chair across from her and bombard her with questions, or just come to chat and enjoy her delicious cupcakes. There wasn’t a single time when she didn’t greet me with a warm smile. Kelley was my first and most important mentor in journalism, and I can confidently say that without her I wouldn’t have ended up in this field. I’m heartbroken that the Thresher and Rice University have lost such an important advocate for student press. – Yasna Haghdoost, Will Rice ’17, Thresher EIC 2016-2017 April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

wildcat_arizona_2022_83,"The New York Time‘s Wordle gives users one five-letter word a day. DoingTheNew York TimesWordleevery day is a worthy and based obsession. It’s quick, easy and makes the brain work. Sometimes it feels like that five-by-six grid will stare at you forever while you miserably contemplate what five-letter word will bring you closer to success. However, on those lucky days, Wordle will be quick and easy and you may feel you haven’t gotten the full Wordle fix. So, I spent an absurd amount of time playing random Wordle-like games on the internet to deliver some alternative options to continue the daily obsession. Here are the 13 alternatives I’ve ranked. 1.Heardle The Heardle requires you to listen to clips of a song and then try and guess it in six tries. I thought it was unique from the original Wordle and a great way to discover new music even if you don’t guess it! 2.Airportle If you’re a frequent flyer this one is perfect for you. You have to guess the three-letter airport code in six tries. For example, Tucson Airport is TUS. It’s super quick and easy, only three letters which is why I liked it. 3.Globle I thought Globle was so interactive and enjoyable. You start by typing a random country and based on the color that country lights up in, that’s how close you are to the country of the day. I thought it was well made and helps with geography. 4.A Greener Worldle How can you not love a name like “A Greener Worldle.” This one is just like Wordle, except it’s all environmental-related words. I think this one is super clever and fun, while also being environmentally friendly! 5.Taylordle Calling all Swifties, this one is for you. This is a Taylor Swift-related Wordle, so basically the dream. True Swifties will not need help with this game, but I did personally have to refer to Spotify for inspiration. 6.Lewdle This one makes me chuckle. It’s essentially Wordle, but only dirty words. No innocence is allowed here. I did enjoy doing this but honestly coming up with five letter naughty words using specific letters was difficult for me. Maybe my head just isn’t in the gutter enough to win this one. 7.Bardle The Bardle is a Shakespeare-related Wordle! You can use Shakespeare-related words or characters. Although, I do feel like that is broad since there are so many words that can be related to Shakespeare, however, I did like it! 8.Flagle You have six tries to guess the flag of the day, each incorrect guess reveals one of the six squares of the flag. It was okay in my opinion. I don’t know very many flags, so it personally wasn’t my favorite. 9.Absurdle This one is sort of annoying. I would recommend you do play at least once since it’s silly. There is no word from the start, but the computer plays against you to narrow down your options based on your previous answers. They honestly just want you to play for as long as you can. You do have unlimited answers which is nice. It is good practice for thinking of five-letter words for the actual Wordle. 10. 11. 12. 13.Dordle/Quordle/Octordle/Sedecordle These four games all fall under the same category because they are all versions of the same Wordle. These are the same as Wordle, except you are doing multiple Wordles at once. Dordle is two games, Quordle is four, Octordle is eight and Sedecordle is a terrifying 16. I have only completed the Dordle, however, more power to you if you’re brave enough to attempt the Quordle and up!

crimson_2022_52,"Disabled people exist at Harvard — but you probably wouldn’t know it at first glance. There are no classes focused on disability taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the undergraduate level this academic year. The former Harvard College Disability Alliance faded out of existence once its leaders graduated. Very few dorms in Harvard Yard are fully accessible. Ableism is almost entirely absent from conversations about diversity and inclusion. Being disabled means facing prejudice and subconscious bias every day, being excluded from events, social gatherings, and opportunities, and feeling unwelcome in what is meant to be our home. As a result of the continued omission of our experiences, disabled students are surrounded by physical and systemic inaccessibility in every sphere of our lives at the College. That’s why we founded the Harvard Undergraduate Disability Justice Club: to remind the Harvard community that we exist on campus. If the College wants to educate “future citizen leaders” as its mission statement proclaims, it must not only acknowledge that disabled people are an essential part of that population, but also demonstrate that we belong in this community through a commitment to accessibility in all aspects of University life. Disability justice is a push towards accessibility and inclusion in all forms for disabled people of all identities. Disabled people make up the single largest minority group in the world. As of 2016, at least 19.4 percent of college students in the United States are disabled. It is also important to recognize that disability can happen without warning to anyone at any point in their life. This consideration is more urgent than ever given that a mass-disabling event is now occurring, with long Covid affecting up to 43 percent of Covid-19 survivors, according to some estimates. Disability justice is relevant to everyone, even if not everyone is aware that it is something we need to strive towards. Prior to founding HUDJ, there was no opportunity for disabled students to connect and learn that we’re not alone in our experiences. It was difficult to find other disabled people on campus — we happened to meet each other through random interactions in classes, at events, or in the dining halls. There is no office or department that holds events where disabled students can get to know each other. The closest thing you could find at Harvard, prior to the pandemic, was the Accessible Education Office Test Center. Yes, the place where stressed-out disabled students silently took their exams was the closest thing to a “community center” we have ever had. Even the Office of BGLTQ Student Life has held more community-building events meant for disabled people than the AEO has. Rather than an affinity space, the AEO is a bureaucratic office that holds power over disabled students. Some of us have had only positive experiences with the AEO, but others have found it difficult to receive the accommodations and support that they need. The AEO Test Center is a frustrating symbol of what we lack, but it’s also a promising reminder that more disabled people attend Harvard than one would think. The difficulty facing us is that there are many members of the Harvard community who would benefit from our advocacy but don’t currently realize it. After all, disability justice is not limited to visible markers of disability; it also includes neurodivergence, mental illnesses, and chronic illnesses — anything from depression to dyslexia. Disabled people are not a monolith, and not all disabled people choose to identify as disabled or even recognize that choice as an option. Some prefer to pass as abled to avoid stigma. Others arrive at Harvard knowing that they are disabled, and still others develop disabilities after arriving at Harvard and are left to their own devices to figure out how to advocate for themselves. There are disabled professors, staff, and graduate students as well — too often their presence at Harvard is overlooked. We founded HUDJ to speak out against injustices as a community, rather than as individuals with complaints that are all too easy for Harvard administration to dismiss. With short-term goals such as advocating for Covid-19 policies that protect the safety of immunocompromised students, faculty, and staff, and long-term goals like establishing a Disability Studies department, HUDJ is striving to bring about critical change on Harvard’s campus that is long overdue. Our aim is not only to create our own community, but also to work together to create long-term institutional policies that will better support students. We’re not asking for pity, and we’re not inspirational simply for taking up the space that we deserve. Instead, what we’re asking is that Harvard students, faculty, and administrators support us as allies in our fight for disability justice by making a conscious effort to ensure accessibility of classes, extracurriculars, and events; speaking out against inaccessibility and ableism on campus; and listening to and learning from us when we share our experiences and perspectives. Harvard prides itself on being a national and global leader. It has the ability to set a powerful standard for the world that catalyzes change. It’s time for Harvard, both as an institution and as a community, to step up and take a prominent role in increasing accessibility and combating ableism on campus. Rachel C.

stanforddaily_2022_79,"The author has requested anonymity for fear of harassment. Content warning: this article contains references to sexual assault. As a survivor, I’ve felt an awful ache this week as friend after friend has told me that they’re rushing. Each day has brought a new conversation, jaw clenched, heart racing and dropping and breaking, as I try to stand my ground and somehow demonstrate that survivors’ experiences, People of Color’s, queer folks’ — my experiences — and everyone who embodies any combination of these identities, are worth making the individual choice to opt out. I ask myself if it’s reasonable to be upset, years of internalized rape culture reminding me to paint myself as overreactive. I hate that I care so much, self-blame again creeping in as I wish I could return to ignorant bliss. I hate that they care so little. I can no longer determine how to feel safe with these friends — friends I’ve disclosed to, friends I’ve been vulnerable with, friends who frat brothers have separated me from with no remorse, leaving me panicked and alone with nobody to walk home with. How can I know my friends won’t become the next doorkeepers, the ones that let assailants stay at the party? How can I know they won’t remain loyal to the institution they’ve paid to be a part of – one that promotes secrecy, protection and maintaining tradition and dominance on this campus? Sexual violence is an inflicted trauma that can come with incredibly dangerous side effects. I think of my own assault, perpetrated by my best friend at the time, and how hopeless I feel three years later. I think of the foreignness I feel in my own body, the ways I wish I could crawl out of skin that no longer feels like my own. I think of how long I spent wishing I could escape a world that I no longer feel at home in. I think of how many survivors share the feeling that assault has ruined their life — it is “survival,” after all — and how many have been killed by a world and culture in which they can never feel safe. So when I think of this university — one at whichtwo in five undergraduate cis women will experience sexual violence before they graduate— I remember that I am not at home here, that a place with such academic achievement has an extremely violent underbelly. That I follow brave women like Chanel Miller and Leah Francis, and so many others, who fought fervently to even be listened to and who were denied justice. Between 1997 and 2014, onlyone rapist was expelledat Stanford, despite nine findings of responsibility for sexual assault during that same period. One. The exceptional part about sexual violence at this school is not that our frats are better at preventing it — it’s that our statistics are twice theaverage across universities in this country. Rape and frat culture are inextricably linked — some “friends” deny this reality, yet the few who acknowledged it expressed any desire or intention to change it. So no, I’m not overreacting when I wince at your plans to pay for this “Sacred Siblinghood” and contributions to upholding rape culture at this university. I’m scared. Students at this university, students of color, gender-marginalized students, queer students and every intersection of these identities deserve to be safe. But more than that, we deserve to be able to exist on this campus with some sense of security. I don’t care if frats control the social scene. I care about the safety and respect of everyone on this campus. I cannot sit idly by as privileged, unscathed students at this university churn out new survivors. Create lives that feel ruined. Rob us of that essential need to feel at home in the world. The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor. We’d love to hear your thoughts.

thetech_mit_2022_20,"As we barrel toward irreversible damage to our climate, it becomes more and more critical to lower emissions and make way for a clean energy future. Over the summer, Congress finally passed legislation, referred to as the “Inflation Reduction Act,” in order to help spur electrification and renewable energy development. However, as Cambridge City Councilor Quinton Zondervan ’95 said in an interview with MIT Divest, “in order for the money to be put to work, there need to be local frameworks.” Indeed, Zondervan is proposing one such framework: theCambridge Green New Deal (GND ,legislationto build a more equitable and sustainable future in Cambridge. The main intent of the GND is to lower emissions from commercial buildings (including many owned and operated by MIT , which Zondervan says account for a majority of Cambridge’s total emissions. In order to encourage commercial interests to lower their emissions, the GND will impose a fine of $254 for every ton of CO2 emitted by new non-residential buildings. The revenue from these fines will partially fund a second part of the GND, theGreen Jobs Ordinance, which will provide free green jobs training programs for lower-income residents of Cambridge. These jobs will include renewable energy development, building emissions reduction, electrification, and urban agriculture. In doing so, “we would use those funds to create economic opportunity for our low income and minority residents who are largely left out of the innovation economy,” Zondervan said, adding, “It’s a double injustice, in that all this pollution is happening in their neighborhoods and then they’re not even getting the economic benefit of that.” Therefore, through the GND, Zondervan hopes to work toward eliminating both the economic and environmental injustices caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Despite the clear benefits of this proposal, some groups remain opposed. According to Zondervan, “The biggest barriers are the commercial interests, because they don’t want to pay for their pollution … And MIT is a big player in that interest group, so it’s really important for the MIT students to be aware of the role that MIT is playing in that conversation.” For example, in a letter to Mayor Siddiqui, MIT and other institutions such as Harvard and the Cambridge City of Commerce argued for amendments allowing the use of carbon offsets to meet their net-zero commitment instead of actually reducing emissions. By buying carbon offsets, institutions can “lower” their carbon footprint by financing carbon capture or emissions reductions in other parts of the world. While carbon offsets are possibly part of the solution to climate change, they are also a method of greenwashing: presented as environmentally friendly while still emitting literal tons of CO2. Carbon offsets allow institutions to continue to pollute locally while claiming to lower their emissions. Funding groups to solve problems elsewhere should be no excuse for not changing behavior here and now, and businesses must keep their promises — MIT is no exception. So why should you, a busy MIT student, care? Firstly, the planet’s future isyourfuture, too. The world at large must soon cease releasing greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, and as part of that world, Cambridge must do its part to reduce its own emissions. Additionally, the GND is also a way to right the wrongs done to historically marginalized communities by giving them more opportunities in the green new economy. As a Cambridge resident, your voice is important. Without it, the GND may not get enough votes to pass. The main way to show support would be to email the city council directly at council@cambridgema.gov. It doesn’t have to be much; as Zondervan said, “Even just a one-paragraph email explaining why you support the Green New Deal for Cambridge would be helpful.” If you’d like to learn more about the GND, MIT Divest is holding a teach-in with Councillor Zondervan next week; find out details and RSVP via ourform(forms.gle/gnXzaz42iGMKg2CJ6 ! There is also a public hearing on November 22 about the GND, and we encourage you to sign up to comment over Zoom at the hearing if you’d like to make your thoughts heard. Further details are available on the Cambridge City Council website attinyurl.com/gnd-hearing-11-22.

crimson_2022_100,"Womengiving birthin metro stations.Kindergartensbombed. Tanksrunningover civilian cars. Over a milliondisplaced. Eight years after the territorial integrity of Ukraine was first violated by its aggressive neighbor Russia, a new chapter in Eastern European history is being written in real time. I will not make this a piece decrying the war in Ukraine. Anyone with a moral compass will tell you that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is wrong. But the symbolic meaning that the conflict occupies in every Eastern European’s mind is that of democratic resistance to tyranny, imperialism, and historical revisionism. The process of rewriting history is not bound to a territory, a country, a continent. Instead, it intertwines with the metaphysical. Our self-perception as Eastern Europeans is constantly defined by others — from analysts in D.C., to Russian scholars on Twitter, or the average American — without any grasp on how the West continuously fails to construct an accurate representation of our identities and the lives we lead. Take Hollywood as an example.Violence,hypersexualizationof women,human trafficking,bad guys— the essence of cinematic Eastern Europeanness. For the entirety of my life, that has been the only representation the West has showcased of me, my cultural space, and the social reality of my home. This representation is completelyinaccurateat the best, and incredibly harmful at the worst. At a time when migrant workers from all across Eastern Europe areexploitedfor their labor in unsafe and appalling conditions in the West, such stereotyping only perpetuates a negative image of Eastern Europeanness. Take “Emily in Paris” as an example (subjectively, one of theworstTV series on the planet . The only cameo of an Eastern European on the show is of aUkrainian womanwho does precisely three things in the series: steals from a department store, curses at Emily in Ukrainian, and constantly worries over her immigration status. But there is another, stranger layer to the portrayal of Eastern Europeans in the media: the chronically-online aestheticization of what I call home. The bimbofication of Eastern European women, also known asSvetlanacoreand“Dark Eastern European aesthetic”(whatever that means , seems to be competing with Y2K themes online as the West gets acquainted with the sociocultural intricacies of this region in the most bizarre way possible. ThepopularTikTok sound “Sudno” by Molchat Doma is another example of this distasteful aestheticization of Eastern Europe that has resulted in an overwhelming exoticization andobsessionwith the region. Discard the poor and superficial humor, and a more complete picture will appear. We are a region traumatized beyond belief. With our intelligentsia systematicallyexterminatedin the 20th century, our private and public lives under thewatchful eye of the statefor over six decades, and individual freedom virtually nonexistent during the same time, the consequences of centuries of exploitation, totalitarianism, and bloodshed seep through everyday life. That is partially whyhomophobia,sexism, andracismare all still so prevalent across Eastern Europe. We have yet to fully cope with the totalitarianization of our private lives as we deal with both shared and individual trauma that spans generations. But there is so much more than the façade of despair, grayness, and destruction that Eastern Europeanness encompasses. We are rapidly changing at a critical speed, and young people are on the veryfrontlines. Autocratic takeovers in the region havemobilizedthe youth and revitalized civil society — something that could for once serve as an example to Westerners themselves. We no longer want to consider ourselves victims as we reposition ourselves along the historical axis. We are slowly deconstructing the tropes of the past as we come to terms with the darkest parts of our history. I, too, am introspecting about my relationship with Eastern Europe. Three out of four classes my freshman fall were in some way or another related to Eastern Europe. It certainly sounds like a targeted choice — even a weird one — for why would a Latvian study Eastern Europe in the United States? Ironically, I get to explore myself and my identity, and the politics and society of Eastern Europe, more at Harvard than I do at home. Harvard has an undergraduate Slavic department; the largest university in Latviadoes not. I get to read contemporary authors from Eastern Europe I had never heard of and consider literary theories in works that would be deemed unacceptable and immoral by a large fraction of Latvian society. In real time, I am redefining Eastern Europeanness for myself. With or without Ukraine. Because that is the only way to escape the abyss of perpetual exoticization, oppression, and falsehoods that paint a bleak picture of what I call home.

crimson_2022_1,"As the United States faces a Covid-19 surge quite unlike any before it, with daily new cases reaching1 millionanda peak potentially yet to come, Harvard’s new pandemic policy flies in the face of both the safety and health of all those affiliated with the University. In an email sent to the Harvard community on Jan. 4, University President Lawrence S. Bacow outlined plans for an in-person spring semester along with new pandemic protocols taking effect upon the semester’s start. Although the promise of an in-person semester brings comfort to some degree – that a semblance of normalcy might still be maintained — the numerous changes made to different protocols leave behind a sense of worry. The biggest change being that in place of isolation housing, students who test positive for the virus will insteadisolate in placein dorms they may share with any number of Covid-negative and/or immunocompromised individuals. The justification offered for this change is threefold. First, the University expects to “have large numbers of cases at Harvard,” seeming to suggest that because of the sheer volume of expected cases, there’s not enough quarantine housing and thus, isolating in dorms is the default. Second, Harvard has “near-universal vaccination,” which leads to the third reason, that the Omicron variant, which is responsible for the rampant surge, is said to beless severethan its predecessors, a point cited by Bacow in the email. Administrators believe the reasons behind this drastic protocol change could be of comfort in an unpredictable time. If anything, these reasons only underscore Harvard s lack of care for the safety and health of its community as well as a blatant attempt to protect its own interests. For a school that’s taken the pandemic very seriously — and rightly so — the past 22 months, these new policies don’t align with Harvard’s previous actions. In March 2020, Harvard was one of thefirst schoolsin Massachusetts to move classes online and shut down in the wake of the pandemic. With theconsiderable influencethat the University holds, it’s not surprising that other schoolsquickly followedsuit. The following academic year, while other universities rushed to in-person classes only to be faced withwidespread outbreaks, Harvard wiselyplayed it safe, with remote learning and limited campus density. In fall 2021,Harvard re-openedwith a vaccine requirement and a rigorous testing regimen that ensured low case numbers throughout the semester. These were the actions of a university that cared about its community enough to go the extra mile to keep it safe. As the pandemic evolved, Harvard’s strategies evolved with it, which made it clear that the school was keeping students’ best interests in mind. Now, the only thing that remains clear is that Harvard is giving up. Expecting large numbers of cases in the upcoming weeks isn’t a reason to shift from quarantine housing to quarantine-in-place. Rather, having that expectation should prompt the University to search for alternatives and find ways to expand existing isolation housing. With an endowment that soared to over$50 billionlast year, Harvard possesses more than enough resources to not put students in the completely unreasonable position of quarantining amongst their peers in the event they test positive. Secondly, a high vaccination rate won’t completely stop the spread of the variant. In Massachusetts, the most vaccinated state in the country,75%of people are fully vaccinated. Still, the positivity rate in the statesoared to over 23%on Jan. 7. Even with a newly instatedbooster requirement,Covid-19 can run rampant throughout campus and Harvard is accepting that, putting people at risk in the process. It’s not enough to say the Omicron variant has “less serious consequences” and leave students to fend for themselves. This flippancy is dangerous, especially for members of Harvard’s community who are immunocompromised. Catching the Omicron variant would not be any “less serious” for them. Clearly, Harvard doesn’t care. If a student hasn’t come into contact with the virus at some point over winter break, Harvard’s new protocol all but ensures they will when they return to campus. Only after facingpressurefrom students did Harvard offer minor concessions in a way that makes one wonder why they weren’t given in the first place. In an email sent Jan. 13, the Dean of Students Office detailed additonal protocols for return to residential life, with the added concessions of school-provided rapid tests, HEPA filters, and KN95 masks. Despite vocal student concern, no major changes were made to quarantining guidelines. Students are still expected to quarantine in their dorms, or otherwise figure out isolation on their own, placing the onus firmly on everyone but Harvard. It’s unacceptable. With all the money the school has, and all the time it had to foresee this problem, students should be receiving more than masks and filters. It’s understandable that Harvard wants to protect the integrity of the spring semester as much as possible, but when huge swaths of the community begin catching the virus and problems mount, the school will only have itself to blame when there’s not much of a spring semester to be had.

thetech_mit_2022_36,"What is the purpose of your business? Does it have one aside from making money? Does your investing or your product make the world better for anyone besides shareholders, customers, and employees? We ask because we want jobs through which we can make the world a better place, just like you. We need financial security, but we want a sense of purpose too. We also ask because the set of companies we traditionally see labeled as “social impact” never includes the security tech companies we get excited about. Most firms with the social impact label serve disempowered groups, such as families priced out of affordable education in their community, or help correct broader negative market externalities, such as climate change. The impact of these mission-oriented social impact companies is incredible. We are thankful for them every day because the problems they tackle head-on are urgent. These companies are just like security technology companies. A for-profit construction company with a mandate to build affordable, green homes delivers social impact in the same way as a for-profit drone manufacturer with a mandate to help democracies defend themselves. The perception of defense tech as warheads on foreheads is not inaccurate. However, it is neither (1 holistic nor (2 disqualifying from the label of social impact. Security tech is much more than missiles and drones.We can trace the origins of modern “defense tech” back to early aviation and MIT’s success developing technologies like RADAR. Cold War missile and space tech drove the industry through the 20th century, as did kit for the later war on terror, such as bomb-disarming robots. But the ecosystem is much broader. Most of the startups we follow today are using analytics or cyber or hardware solutions to solve problems for a broader array of stakeholders than just the Department of Defense. MIT security tech startups are helping first responders, election officials, intelligence agencies, energy companies, and the military. Making weapons does not disqualify a company from doing good for the world.The same RADAR that was developed at MIT — not a weapon but an essential upgrade for the “kill chain” to combat bad guys — turned the tide early in World War II. Before that technology, U-boats ran amok in the Atlantic, sinking Allied ships indiscriminately, most of which were civilian cargo vessels. With RADAR, Allied planes could finally find and target U-Boats, ending their free reign. Without that defense tech, the Nazis could have starved out Britain. Many more allied sailors and civilians crossing the Atlantic would have died. Today, Boston Dynamics’s Spot robots assist police and military units across the world, aiding in rescue operations, hostage extractions and ordinance disposal to save lives. In summary, the ecosystem or industry we’re talking about is not just lethal defense tech, but security tech more broadly. Moreover — especially with Ukraine under attack and tensions over Taiwan rising — the security challenges faced by global democracies are severe enough to make even kill chain tech, wielded appropriately, a social net-positive. As co-presidents of what was previously Sloan’s Defense Tech Club, we have changed the name to the Global Security Tech Club. We acknowledge the counterargument that any tech used to kill people or spy on people can be used for nefarious purposes. This counterargument is strong and viable in many cases. However, tech solutions can and must be used to strengthen our democracy. The Allied tech ecosystem must continue to overmatch Chinese and Russian militaries in technical warfighting to deter further encroachment on sovereign democracies. We must choose to shape technology to secure our intellectual property, our elections, our energy grid, our internet, and our way of life. To achieve this, we need innovative leaders in security technology. If these leaders are not at MIT, where would they be? Democracy needs MIT students thinking about the grave security challenges it faces and innovating on a mission to solve them. Democracy needs MIT students.

crimson_2022_116,"In just a few days, the Harvard Undergraduate Association will hold its first elections. They will be its first sin. To understand this requires understanding how we arrived here. When the roiling controversy (and outrightbigotry that met the proposal to replace the Undergraduate Council ended with the HUA’s resoundingaffirmationby over three-quarters of students, there was a sense of finality. Just like that, they were gone — the self-righteous UC careerists, the racists that supported them, the hated, moribund form of a decades-old body known for bureaucracy, ambition, and little else. These are the kinds of victories that we like to believe inaugurate real change. But it hasn’t. The HUA suffers from precisely the same structural flaw that ruined all of its predecessors, from the original sin of student government: that we elect it. In some sense, student government represents us. Its constitution says so. The sickly-sweet overseriousness of its campaigns looks like real representative politics. But the core of representation lies in the people doing the representing. In a community as small as ours, government is personal — unlike in national politics, we have the privilege of knowing who represents us and the values they hold. The people are the soul of student government. And they continually fail it. They are not, to be sure, all or even mostly bad people. Intentions aside, they do hard, thankless work that has kept clubs funded and delivered valuable initiatives. But, at a school chosen for resources and prestige, student government can seem the shiniest trophy in an embarrassment of riches. High stakes, a grueling campaign process, and the thankless work that comes after form a powerful mechanism for self-selection. Elections for any Harvard student government invariably choose at least a handful of people who are calculating and insincere. They, most prominent of their peers, define the institution. Totally irrespective of how it performs, then, students dislike and reject our student government because they feel that it does not represent us, that its values and methods fundamentally diverge from ours. That’s how a student government thatmadeLamont an overnight library,establishedthe blue-light alarm system,centralizedonline information about clubs, anddeliveredsummer storage dies — because policy comes second to character when the scale is personal. This is the original sin of student government, and it taints the body from the moment it comes into existence. Though our institutional memory seems hazy on this point, it has doomed every student government that has come before this one too. In 2019, a UC abolition campaigndeclared“a campaign to end campaigns”; in 1983, a UC representativehopedto “eventually abolish the Council”; in 1965, the Student Council, from which Dunster House seceded, wasabolished, a development foreshadowed by a 1950petitioncontending that there is nothing that the Student Council does which would not either be done better by someone else or be better not done at all.” The problem is endemic. Buying into the technocrat’s hope — the blind belief that a smarter, newer system will succeed where all others failed — is foolish, ahistorical, and will ensure that this campus goes on hating the generally decent people that govern it while periodically tearing the whole thing down. To break this sordid chain of failures demands a clean break, a solution that aligns the student body with its representation by making them one and the same. The most democratic, most representative student government is one that doesn’t hold elections at all. Instead, students would be far better served by a number of official, entirely volunteer-based advisory bodies focused on particular issues facing the student body (mental health, social life, etc. . Such a model would untether representation from willingness to campaign and eliminate the poisonous electoral self-selection that has destroyed every student government to date. These bodies would work within our community to advocate for students, interface with administration, and spearhead voluntarist initiatives that directly, meaningfully improve student life. The mental health group, for one, could coordinate with student counseling organizations to help the Dean of Students Office overhaul ourhole-filledmental-health support system. The social life team might apply for funding to hold school-wide social events like Yardfest for example. Club funding, meanwhile, should be transferred to a new, independent, application-based student body unswayed by politics and invulnerable to dissolution. The chaos of post-UC, pre-HUA club funding attests that this change is long overdue. The HUA got some of this right, but the original sin remains. In reducing the number of elected positions, the HUA begins a more furious race for the prestige of just nine spots. On its inaugural ballot, you will find a powerful testament to this stasis masquerading as change: Four of the six tickets vying for HUA co-President feature long-time members of the UC. The original sin of this school comes with awkwardly fitting a fractured template for representative government from the outside world onto a community small enough to lead itself cooperatively. To absolve it, we must choose something different, better — a politics of direct democracy, of personality, and of action. Our history, because we fail to learn it, repeats itself. For this failure, the moment it is born, the HUA will fate itself to die. Tommy Barone ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Weld Hall."
state_press_2022_63,"ASU should take steps to add more financial options by increasing specific scholarships for those with incarcerated parents. Rowan Universityreports that 2.7 million children in the U.S. have a parent who is incarcerated and approximately 10 million have experienced parental incarceration at some point in their lives. With expansive numbers like these, it is imperative that the ASU communitylistens to the needs of these young adults. ASU needs to add more options by increasing specific scholarships for those with incarcerated parents. Many students facing parental incarceration have greater numbers of adverse childhood experiences, also referred to asACEs, a term used within juvenile justice studies dealing with abuse, neglect and being in foster care. TheArizona Department of Childhood Safetyreports that close to 14,000 children in Arizona are in foster care, a common experience with students who are affected by parental incarceration. This past summer, I spent every Wednesday at a juvenile correctional facility for a research project for youth with incarcerated parents. It became apparent that there is a concerning lack of educational resources for these young adults. Many of them are already at a disadvantage by being in the foster care system and coming from unconventional households. Receiving higher education should not be on their list of worries. Under ASU s scholarship search, there are currently no scholarships offered to students facing parental incarceration. One of the few options students have is to file as an independent on their FAFSA, but this option is limited as it is only available to students who can provide documentation proving both parents are absent. This stipulation creates an unnecessary barrier for students seeking higher education while facing parental incarceration. Jordan Maldonado, an Arizona resident who has incarcerated parents, spoke about the obstacles she faced when considering ASU as a place to attend. She said that the financial barriers of having an incarcerated parent, (were one of the biggest reasons that contributed to (her not going to college. Maldonado said that FAFSA was the only resource she could find to help her afford schooling, which was simply not enough. She argued that programs specifically designed for students facing parental incarceration could have not only aided her in attending school but motivated her to do better in school in general. It would have definitely motivated me to dobetter in collegebecause I would have known it wasn t just me, Maldonado said. I would have had to uphold (certain standards since I would be receiving help or rewards. Many students who do go on to receive higher education are incredibly motivated individuals, supporting Maldonado’s testimony. Rowan University reports that a variety of students affected by parental incarceration described school as a safe place or escape, while others describe their hardships as motivating factors for success. Currently, ASU s onlyprogramsfor youth in foster care, the Arizona Foster Youth Award and the Arizona Education and Training Voucher, are extremely limited. The eligibility requirements for the Arizona Foster Youth Award hinder a lot of possible recipients, with strict age guidelines for when someone would have had to be in the system along with requiring applicants to be Arizona residents. Many children in juvenile correctional centers are moved around quite a bit and are not necessarily Arizona residents even after being placed in the state. In addition to this, the Arizona Foster Youth Award only covers tuition, leaving students to wonder how they will cover the cost of food, housing, transportation and educational supplies. The Arizona Education and Training Voucher, focused on assisting those who have aged out of the foster care system, only awards $2,500 per semester, leaving a significant amount of expenses unaccounted for. Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College Principle Research Specialist Heather Griller Clark advocates for ASU to expand scholarship resources for the students in this community. We know that education is a protective factor that strengthens well-being and helps mitigate risks associated with having an incarcerated parent, so the more opportunities a child has to receive educational funding or scholarships, the more likely that child is to succeed, Griller Clark said. While ASU holds the annualChildren of Incarcerated Parents National Conferencewhich aims to further awareness of the impact of incarceration on children, there still is a concerning lack of resources for the children affected by parental incarceration and other ACEs. With growing incarceration numbers, and given that nearly half of those incarcerated in state prisons are parents of minors, scholarship expansions for affected youth could significantly improve their situation. ASU should consider supporting young adults in adverse situations by increasing specific scholarships for those with incarcerated parents.

rice_thresher_2022_17,"ByThresher Editorial Board9/27/22 10:47pm Every week, the Thresher’s Backpage staff spend their Monday nights in a corner of our office coming up with a satirical take on the week’s news. Their goal is simple: to bring some levity to what might otherwise be a dreary week of problem sets, essays and exams. Their works of comedy also serve as a delightful ending to much of our more serious journalistic content; and for this reason, the Backpage is a consistent favorite for many of our readers. But despite the Backpage being a central part of every issue, we’ve realized that it’s important to clarify that, with its own group of staff members, the Backpage is a separate section from the rest of the Thresher. While we demand unbiased, thorough reporting in our other sections, the Backpage is not journalism, and we do not treat it as such. The quips and banter poking fun at current campus affairs are made with the sole purpose of entertaining, not informing the Rice community. That’s what the rest of the paper is for. We understand that the Backpage content sometimes offends people. Satire does offend. We strive to ensure that the Backpage does not stereotype or capitalize on marginalized communities. But other than keeping common-sense decency, we encourage the Backpage staff to come up with ingenious jokes, practice their free speech and, most importantly, to have as much fun as possible while doing their jobs. The Backpage has relentlessly mocked both Rice University administration and the undergraduate student population for years. It is also not uncommon to see the Backpage content seemingly “contradict” itself, as they’ve made fun of the frequency of COVID testing and the lack of COVID testing at Rice in almost consecutive weeks. The Backpage is not written with a fixed agenda in mind, as comedy often isn’t. In today’s world, it can sometimes be hard to tell just where the jokes end and earnest beliefs begin. Therein lies the beauty of the Backpage — it’s a joke! All of their content, every single week, cannot be taken out of context or misconstrued. We should celebrate the fact that such a space exists. We hope, moving forward, that our readership will not conflate our satire section with the totality of our paper’s content. However, if you really want to voice your complaints, refer to the disclaimer at the bottom of the page and emaildilfhunter69@rice.edu.

As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_13,"A few weeks back, The Crimson held its first News-Editorial social in recent memory. I bring this up not to reminisce on the bacchanalia that may or may not have ensued, but rather to point out the significance of the event, the announcement of which brought with it joking cries to “tear down this wall.” The reason for this reaction was not a belated response to the death of Mikhail Gorbachev, but rather a wisecrack meant to poke fun at the institutional norm that defines the daily activities of The Crimson:the News-Editorial wall. This (non-physical wall separates the personnel and work of the News Board — which is devoted to objective, unbiased journalism — and the Editorial Board, which opines on topics. This strict separation is one of many structures put in place to ensure that The Crimson remains an objective source of news for the general public. But, if not torn down outright, the wall and the goal of objective journalism it exists to attain needs to be reconsidered. Firstly, objective journalism is impossible to begin with. The Crimson, when deciding what news to cover, inherently makes a decision about what information is newsworthy. For example, this newspaper’sextensive coverageof the sexual harassment allegations and subsequent investigation against Professor John L. Comaroff reflects its judgment that abuses of power are so important to expose that every twist and turn of the situation merits coverage. This is uncontroversial in this case, but it is still an implicit value judgment. The reason news organizations can never be truly objective is because their purpose is not just to give information to the public, but to construct a narrative that shows why it matters. Former Crimson editor and “father of modern journalism” Walter Lippmann ’10 wrote that “The function of news is to signalize an event, the function of truth is to bring to light the hidden facts, to set them into relation with each other, and make a picture of reality on which men can act.” In constructing these narratives, news organizations are inherently making judgments about what sort of narrative is useful to the public. That truly objective journalism is an unattainable ideal is not a unique claim, though. Many believe that even if newspapers will never be unbiased, objectivity remains an ideal worth seeking. Yet objectivity is still a flawed goal. In pursuit of objectivity, journalists follow a set of industry norms built up over time that defines what is newsworthy. As Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at NYU, put it, newsworthiness becomes like “a machine that nobody remembers how it was built.” In so refusing to make a conscious, agential decision about what constitutes newsworthiness, newspapers attempt to absolve themselves of responsibility and give readers the false impression that they are merely showing them reality. But newspapers aren’t ethereal mirrors that offer, to quote Rosen, a “view from nowhere.” Like it or not, they play an active role in society, and failure to recognize that leads them to have problematic effects on the very news they report. Take the Trump presidency. Whenever mainstream organizations reported on an outrageous, bombastic action by Trump, they were relying on the implicit judgment that a bombastic president was newsworthy. In doing so, they incentivized Trump to continue acting this way to dominate the news cycle. But did it have to be that way? As Ezra Klein has wonderedon his podcast, what if the bar for covering Trump was that he had to “produce policy plans and say something worth covering as opposed to acting like an insult comic dog”? In 1976, economist Robert Lucas published a paper that later became known as the Lucas critique. The idea was as follows: If economic models rely on the optimal actions of agents and the policy recommendations that they make inevitably change the economic structure and therefore agents’ optimal actions, then the recommendation itself becomes invalid. From then on, actors like the Fed needed to anticipate how the public would react to their actions in order to properly administer policy. News organizations should do the same. In some sense, to pursue objectivity at all, they must be self-conscious of their non-objective role in society. Where do these critiques leave journalism? At first, it seems like the only alternative to objectivity is subjectivity. But journalism can retain its mission of creating informed, active members of society without attempting to be objective in the strictly-defined present sense. After Paris was liberated during WWII, Albert Camus advanced a new view on the ideal role of news organizations with his newly-founded newspaper, Combat. Camus argued that newspapers should embrace the fact that they need to make critical judgments to construct effective narratives. This “critical journalism” would then enable citizens to participate in society by making informed judgments. Most importantly, newspapers should be completely transparent about their critical mission. Newspapers today should heed Camus and Lucas. It’s impossible for them to avoid making value judgments about the stories they publish. Instead, they should make concrete what their priorities are (Democracy? Civil Rights? , publicly acknowledge these priorities, and be honest with themselves about the role they play in the narrative. This is the only way that news organizations can fulfill their true purpose, to provide citizens with the information necessary to become active and productive members of society. Manuel A.

thetech_mit_2022_61,"Last fall, faculty in the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research (IWER called on MIT’s faculty and administrationto respect students’ right to decide whether or not to support unionization. They also called on the administration and the student union organizers to engage in a collaborative process regarding unionization: for example, by agreeing to ground rules for the organizing, election, and initial contract negotiation if the majority of students voted for the union. Their hope, and ours, is for a thoughtful process with respectful interactions that help MIT to emerge as an even stronger institution. However, the chancellor and vice chancellorwrote to graduate studentsFeb. 27 stating that “MIT’s senior leaders do not believe that a graduate student union is the best path forward for current and future graduate students.” While it is the graduate students participating in the election who will decide whether to unionize, the administration and faculty can, and do, exert leverage. On Feb. 2, the chancellor and provost wrote to MIT’s faculty with a set of talking points with which to address their graduate students, along with a list of do’s and don’ts to ensure compliance with the National Labor Relations Act. Among the talking points is this: “For example, it is permitted for a faculty member to say that they do not wish to see a graduate student union come to MIT or that they hope the union will be defeated. As long as there are no threats or promises, a supervisor or faculty member may freely express their opinion at any time. They may engage fully in a campaign to inform students about the union and/or persuade students to vote against the union.” Moreover, the vice chancellor has attended at least one departmental faculty meeting to encourage faculty to oppose unionization. These actions are distressing to us as they violate the spirit of neutrality needed to “ensure that faculty-student relationships will not be adversely affected, regardless of the outcome of the organizing process” (IWER letter . In thecurrent issue of the Faculty Newsletter, one of the authors of the IWER letter notes that while the content of the talking points “is within the law, having faculty (who exercise considerable power regarding the careers of their grad students counsel with their grad students may not honor the maxim: ‘Let the students decide.’” We call on faculty to avoid, even if unintentional, the appearance of coercion. We pledge to not attempt to persuade graduate students how to vote on unionization and to avoid presenting one-sided views for or against unionization. We also pledge to work collaboratively with graduate students in research and teaching, as befits the MIT mission, regardless of the outcome of the unionization vote next month. We encourage other faculty tosign our open letter.

state_press_2022_34,"Despite the fact that classes were virtual when cases were a fraction of the current numbers, ASU has turned a blind eye to the current situation and forced students to fend for themselves. ASU classes have been back in session for less than a month now, and things have been a train wreck ever since. On Jan. 17, we reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases ever recorded on campus, at a staggering2,345ASU community members testing positive for COVID-19. Despite the fact that classes were virtual when cases were a fraction of the current numbers, ASU has turned a blind eye to the current situation and forced students to fend for themselves. ASU s current COVID-19 management policy puts students at risk. If ASU really cared about students, it would hold classes remotely. In-person classes show a disregard for immunocompromised students, staff and community members, putting their health in danger of long-term consequences. At this stage in the pandemic, there is a general consensus among some that everyone is going to get COVID-19 at some point, so we should just let it blow through our population. While most of us will likely survive COVID-19, especially those of us who are vaccinated and boosted, the same cannot be said for immunocompromised people. According to theAmerican Society for Microbiology, COVID-19 vaccines are less likely to produce an immune response for cancer survivors and people who have had organ transplants. This means that these people are likely reliant on herd immunity, and with only 55% of Maricopa County residents at least partially vaccinated, we aren’t quite there yet. The way that ASU is handling this current inning of the pandemic isn t anything new. After all,ASUcaved to Doug Ducey s ridiculous agenda, not requiring vaccines among students, nor requiring testing among unvaccinated students. Honestly, I feel like we should be doing online at this point, said Malaysia Walton-Gaines, a freshman studying social work. I know when we all came back from winter break, and people coming from different parts of the country and everything, there was such an outbreak in the dorms. ASU has the resources to go back to remote learning if it wanted to. After all, the University blew $12 million offundingfrom the CARES Act on creating the infrastructure for ASU Sync and online learning. Why not use it? We certainly offer a quality level of instruction remotely … I think that the University does a really good job of that because there s such an online presence for the school, so I think it can be done, said Victor Fazio, a faculty associate with the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice. At this point in the pandemic, we are forcing immunocompromised people to put their lives at risk every day in order to go to class while unvaccinated people continue to walk aroundspreading the viruswithout having to face any repercussions. ASU students in the disability community have expressed their concerns about having in-person classes as more students call out sick. Some of these students worry that they may become seriously ill should they contract the virus. The omicron variant is one of the fastest-spreading variants of the COVID-19 virus to date. Variants are created when more people get infected with a virus. We would not be in the situation that we are currently in if people cared enough about our immunocompromised population to get vaccinated. The argument for in-person learning is the fact that the omicron variant is said to be milder than previous variants. As University of Virginia critical care physician Taison Bell said in an interview with NPR, omicron is milder the same way that a hurricane is milder than a tornado. The fact is, people who catch COVID-19, even mild to moderate cases, are still at risk for long COVID. Difficulty breathing, changes in taste or smell, brain fog, fatigue and a long list of other symptoms can last for weeks or months after infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If we can do more to prevent this kind of thing from happening to people, why don t we? At this point, it would be impossible for ASU to reverse the damage that it s done, but it can stop this outbreak now by going online until the outbreak subsides, and it require students to get vaccinated and boosted. The current direction that ASU is going in has already led to a massive outbreak that could lead to long-term side effects for hundreds of students who were previously healthy. Even worse, immunocompromised students have to fear for their lives just to get an education. But hey, as long as the University can make a quick buck, right?

crimson_2022_141,"Therecent“Report of the Committee on Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery” is a necessary work of scholarship and thought which is long overdue. While in awe of the authors and their superior knowledge of both Harvard and slavery, I remain troubled by something that is missing. The report discusses the legacies of slavery that remained after the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution “conferred emancipation nationwide in 1865.” However, it stops short of addressing the full text of the 13th Amendment, wherein slavery is abolished “except as a punishment for crime,” and makes no mention of Harvard’s current role in thesystemthat emerged from this exception. In reality, slavery has never been completely banned in this country or in Massachusetts. The path from slavery and slave patrols to our racistcarceralandpolicing systemsis well-documented. I will not attempt to instruct the reader in the history and horrors of prisons, jails, and detention centers in the United States and Massachusetts, or the violent policing that accompanies them. I have only been arrested and locked up overnight after protesting outside such a facility and know that my treatment was much better than average. It took weeks for me to heal both physically and psychologically from just that little bit, yet others endure much harsher treatment for longer — or evendieat the hands of this system, which is bolstered by racism. Incarcerated people are compelled to perform what can best be described asslave laborand the bodies of the criminalized arecommodifiedin business calculations and deals — even inside prisons which are not operated by private corporations. I struggle to understand what it can mean for an academic institution to redress its legacy of slavery while ignoring its own ongoing role in perpetuating these unbearable wrongs. Harvard affiliates and alumni continue to incarcerate other human beings through their work in government and the legal profession. How many advance their careers by producing intellectual justifications for legalized slavery? While other Harvard affiliates already do outstanding work for abolition, what could the institution do to make that the norm? Although the report recommended many actions Harvard could take to reckon with its historical role in slavery, it did not offer much about present-day abolition. Harvard’s first step towards abolition must be a commitment to never again invest in corporations that implement or benefit from incarceration, taking guidance from theHarvard Prison Divestment Campaign. The most visibly harmful of these investments are in private prison corporations, but there are many others that exploit prison labor or provide goods and services necessary for the operation of government-run carceral institutions. Without prison divestment, is it not fair to say that slavery continues to fund Harvard University — and that Harvard funds slavery? For as long as slavery continues to existby any name, abolition demands that we work to liberate those who are not free. Where we cannot yet physically liberate, we must still advance the freedom and dignity of incarcerated people. The students I met while teaching in the Education Justice Project — the University of Illinois’ college-in-prison program — offered the most eloquent endorsements of the liberatory value of education that I have ever heard. I can attest to the fact that there are excellent, overachieving students hungry for knowledge, who are locked up with onlylimited accessto reading material andlimited study timedue to their aforementioned labor. Several institutions of higher learning offer college-in-prison programs, but potential college students in the carceral system remain overwhelmingly underserved. Some are entirely deprived of their human right to higher education, and others can only access correspondence classes or programs offered by Christian colleges that eschew secular accreditation. It is time to establish a for-credit Harvard-in-prison program which would offer a superior education to the talented students incarcerated in the region. At present, only a tiny percentage of free people enjoy access to a Harvard education. But is anyone ever admitted to Harvard College from prison? As we continue the work of abolition, why not offer the liberatory power of a Harvard education as one of our efforts? If the institution would support a college-in-prison program, I would, along with other faculty and students, help to make it a reality. Could some of those $100 million dollars allocated towards reckoning with Harvard’s legacy of slavery be directed towards the liberation of people who are still not free? Sara M.

stanforddaily_2022_80,"As the first speaker of “Faces of Community” walked up the podium in Frost Amphitheater, the screen over her head immediately caught the audience’s attention. During thisconvocationof the Stanford Class of 2025 and transfer students, the colorfully illustrated texts like “Content warning: sexual assault, violence” on the LED screen became one of the first impressions that Stanford left on us. For some, this represented Stanford’s protection of those who are experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD , while I viewed it as the institution’s meticulous effort to steer the line of political correctness in a way that does not offer concrete assistance to those in need. The concept of a trigger warning originated from thepsychiatric literatureto describe the process by which thoughts and images can bring traumatic events back to life for those experiencing PTSD, unleashing re-experiencing symptoms such as intense fear. With the rise of the focus on mental health across the country in the last few years, “care culture” — an environment in which those in a position of power are responsible for protecting the mental health of others — has surged on college campuses and the art community, two highly liberal-minded contexts. These changes, however, are often initiated from the bottom-up: from students pressuring professors and audience pressuring artists. According to aNational Coalition Against Censorship survey, more than 34% of the surveyed university-level educators reported that their students pushed for the use of trigger warnings or made complaints about lack thereof, while more than half believe the warnings to be detrimental to classroom dynamics and/or academic freedom. Directors of artistic production alsocomplainedof having to spoil elements of their work but eventually gave in to the use of warnings out of consideration of the wishes of their patrons. For professors, including a content warning often entails merely adding a line or two about an assigned reading or film on the syllabus. The artist, however, has much more at stake in revealing details regarding their work. As argued by twentieth-century literary criticViktor Shklovsky, one of the most important characteristics of art is its ability to unveil reality to the audience by “making-strange” day-to-day details, the ability of which would be significantly impaired by alerting the audience of what will happen ahead of time. While many argue that a good piece of art has the ability to surprise the audience despite the warnings, the popularized “care culture” norms in the consumer-driven art world means that those in the creative industry often need to present their message in a way that does not upset the audience. That audience can in turn use the public attention surrounding mental health to block out the content that they do not want to see. These norms tie the hands of the artists, who for centuries have been at the frontline of protesting societal oppression, like that of minorities. In the arts scene at Stanford, a liberal educational institution, the use of content warnings is no less prevalent. The event description of Asian American Theater Project’s December production ofAmong the Dead— which tells the story of the identity quest of Ana Woods, born of an American soldier and a Korean comfort woman during World War II —alertedthe audience of “war violence, sexual violence, and M**der”; the refusal to fully write out the word “murder” is reminiscent of censorship. Moreover, trigger warnings alone are often insufficient in helping those experiencing PTSD process their trauma.Studieshave shown that they do not alleviate trauma-survivors’ negative emotional response to certain materials and can even result in their greater anxiety. Their usage has persisted in the art world regardless. In effect, in pressuring artists to adopt the warnings, cultural authorities are shifting their responsibility to provide resources beneficial to the mental health of the citizens to the artists, creating an unnecessary burden on the latter and oftentimes limiting their expression. “Just like we do not ask hospitals and doctors to perform in purpose-built environments for learning, entertainment, and social change, we should not demand that theaters and artists should become arbiters of what is triggering or potentially traumatic to an infinite number of possible audience members,” argued theater and performance studies professor Samer al-Saber in an email to The Daily. In a lecture to the students ofITALIC91, Professor al-Saber voiced his opinion that in entering the theater the audience signs a contract with the artists to experience the production fully. To protect both those processing trauma and the artists’ right to make social impacts by impressing the audience, the path that Stanford and other institutions should take is to better provide mental health resources to the population and support artists’ free expression. Even so, as expressed by Professor al-Saber, “Given the size of the task and challenge ahead, as well as the absence of sufficient mental health care in the USA, I think audience members are best served by taking extra care in choosing which performances they should see. Call the theater ahead of time and ask about what you consider to be triggering to you. Do the research and make the choice in advance.” Yuanlin Linda Liu ‘25 is The Daily s vol. 266 editor-in-chief.

crimson_2022_44,"In August of 1933, a 65-year-old, heavy-hearted W.E.B. Du Bois, Class of 1890, founder and editor of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s magazine, “the Crisis,” published an article titled “The Negro College.” In it, Du Bois expressed a radical commitment to exclusively-Black education in the face of Jim Crow, a fierce declaration that would get him into a lot of trouble, both with his readers and the NAACP’s leadership. In fact, the following summer, the conflict would lead to his resignation. Du Bois begins the essay by criticizing Black educators who insist that a Black college is “nothing more and nothing less than a university.” No, Du Bois, writes. Stop assimilating. They are Black universities. For Du Bois, to advocate against race-consciousness in historically Black institutions of learning naively assumed an inevitable racial progress in the Jim Crow Era. Instead, America needed these colleges to prepare Black students for the real world, such that they could learn “exactly how and where…to establish a reasonable Life in the United States.” Du Bois’ readers correctly understood him to be advocating for segregation. At this point in his life, he had begun to cope with racism’s permanence in the industrial system. Du Bois had his share of education, graduating from Fisk University in 1888, earning a second bachelor’s from Harvard in 1890, and five years later, in 1895, becoming the first African American to receive a PhD from Harvard. He spent the majority of his adult life fighting for integration through both academia and journalism, trying to convince whites that Blacks were worthy of their support. And still, it seemed like segregation in the educational system was onlysolidifying. The only viable alternative was to pivot inwards. Black people, through “voluntary determined cooperative effort,” would have to establish their own Black institutions in their own communities. With great time and effort, they would fight their way back into a diverse American public sphere. Du Bois’ dreary vision of racial separation in 1933 is darkly prophetic, perhaps. It is the world Students for Fair Admissions wants. This October, the Supreme Court took up Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, a landmark case challenging Harvard’s race-conscious admissions. Using the classic white supremacist move — pitting minorities against one another — SFFA asserts that Harvard’s race-conscious admissions “penalizes Asian Americans” for the undue benefit of African American and Latinx applicants. Such a conniving conservative argument (“race-conscious admissions are reverse racism!” is just another instance of white supremacy wagging its unwieldy head, calling discriminatory a measure designed to correct the discrimination that white supremacists themselves have perpetuated. If affirmative action is overturned, Harvard’s percentage of Black and Latinx students may shrink into non-existence, particularly impacting Generational African Americans, who are already estimated to be severelyunderrepresentedat the University. Institutional bias will go unchecked and the admissions office’spreferencefor legacy students will only strengthen. Harvard admissions, the so-called colorblind institution SFFA dreams of, will increasingly shatter the dreams of Black and Latinx high school applicants. If SFFA gets what it wants, what Du Bois called the “Color Line” in education will only sharpen. Black and Latinx students will be forced to become increasingly conscious of their racial identities as they watch Harvard retrogress to its white racial status. A few weeks ago, a large group of Black Harvard students traveled to Washington D.C. to celebrate an annual football game at “The Mecca,” that is, the illustrious Howard University. To be in an oasis of knowledge beyond the white gaze was a little taste of heaven. When we asked students about their experience, they had their trifles with administrative processes, as most of us do. But when it came to their racial identity, one thing was abundantly clear: at Howard, it felt easier to be authentic, to explore the intellectual and social world around you without having to be overly conscious of your skin color. I didn’t apply to Howard in high school because I wasn’t aware of its importance. The alienation I have experienced on Harvard’s campus has made that importance abundantly clear. Black students on this campus are tired of being looked at sideways when we self-congregate. We are tired of the fact that there is no physicalspacefor us on campus. We are tired of the fact that to fit in, we must assimilate intowhite final clubs. We are tired of so-called “progressive” answers in the classroom that sound woke but lack substance. Almost 90 years after “The Negro College” was published, we wrestle with the temptation to retrogress to separate schooling: a dystopian America where droves of Black students stop applying to white schools and turn to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Where elite institutions are further deprived of the gift that is diversity. I would hope that the onset of such a segregated world is unlikely. But if that is the world that Students for Fair Admissions want, then so be it. Howard, here we come!

rice_thresher_2022_40,"ByJoseph Asfouri3/29/22 10:53pm While life at Rice seems to return to normal, we must all comprehend that Russian President Vladimir Putin has unleashed hell on Ukraine. Countries including the United States aresanctioning Russia s oligarchs, whose concentration of immense wealth suffices to fund Putin’s war. But those rich Russian terrorists have not acted alone. Decades of wrongdoing by America’s oligarchs, due to our failure to control their greed and power, have also enabled Putin’s present holocaust in Ukraine. As I will lay bare, we must defend ourselves against America’s oligarchs by recognizing and broadcasting their tactics, and by changing our behavior to neutralize these tactics and subvert their power. In doing so, we can help fight the war in Ukraine from within the hedges. Let me first be clear on who I implicate: the multimillionaires and billionaires of big American corporations who prioritize profit above the common good. In an ongoing instance of their evil, instead of absorbing the higher costs of goods brought on by global supply-chain issues, they are passing these costs on to you, the consumer, inflating their pricesbeyond just what they mustto offset the higher costs. And by stealing from our middle class, debilitated by similar past abuses of America’s oligarchs, their monopolies areraking in record profits. The toll of the oligarchs’ unrestrained economic power has extended to Ukraine as well. For nearly two weeks, wehesitatedon a decision with only one morally correct answer: whether to ban Russian energy imports or to continue to finance Putin’s brutality. One reason is thehundreds of millionsspent on political lobbying to obstruct our development of a renewable, self-reliant energy infrastructure, exacerbating climate change and our dependence on foreign energy. But, somehow, price gouging and climate change are not the saddest parts of this story. The truly saddest part is that our Congress is complicit. Hungry for campaign funding, many of our “public servants” are corporate slavesbribed to veto lawswhich threaten the oligarchs’ economic and political power, and bribed to craft laws whichfurther enrich the richest few. How could such corrupt legislators infiltrate our democracy? We the people have been conned into electing these craven traitors by the oligarchs, who have distracted us from their wrongdoing by instigating a culture war. In this war, their weapons are our emotional vulnerabilities. Through media and the mouths of their politician puppets, they spout racism and xenophobia to scapegoat minorities and foreigners, diverting our anger from the true criminals and terrorists who cause our economic woe, and they employ religion to invade our private morality, further fracturing our unity. Ultimately, oligarchs have distracted us from their ever-growing political power by turning Americans against one another. And, when we the people are distracted and divided, our foreign adversaries are enabled and emboldened. For this reason, our oligarchs are not only anti-American – they are pro-Putin, whether or not they themselves brandish it as shamelessly asTrumpandtheir other political instrumentsdo. All humans who know the truth feel worried for the people of Ukraine. Besidesdonating, what can we do? We can modify our behavior toward our fellow Americans on the “other side” of the culture war, strengthening the Rice community and, ultimately, our nation. In doing so, we will weaken foreign autocrats like Putin, domestic wannabe-autocrats like Trump, and their oligarchic backers. We are vulnerable to the oligarchs’ divisive tactics only because we are emotional beings. Today, our sole defense is our willpower. Thus, we must learn to open our eyes and free ourselves from their devices of division. Break away from the self-reinforcing propaganda on news outlets and social media, both far-right and far-left. Override the instinctual fury you feel for your fellow Rice students or other Americans when they express a “radical” belief, even if aimed directly at you or your own values. (For good practice, peruse some of the Thresher’s other recent opinion articles. Of course, we still must unequivocally excise the cancer of misinformation from our national discourse, but do so sensitively and with sympathy for the truly innocent people held captive by those emotional fallacies. Learn not to hate, but to understand the perspective of others at Rice, and try to convince them that you are not their enemy and they are not yours. Reveal to them what I have presented here about our common enemy, to whom you should really be directing your hatred and hostility. Truly, our shared economic pain at the hands of the oligarchs should precede all of the artificial differences they have managed to draw between us with their implements of racism, xenophobia and religion. Our human propensity to polarize into Democrat and Republican, “Trump supporter” and “lib,” is both what hands America’s oligarchs their political power and enables Putin to effect his malicious will with impunity. In this disunited state of these United States, distracted by a culture war that truly need not exist, we have historically and at present failed to stamp out Putin’s barbaric ambitions and to protect the world against his ruthless aggression. Tragically, the beautiful people of Ukraine must now suffer the consequences of our inaction. Now, for the sake of all humanity, we must condemn Putin’s explicit apologists as well as his latent oligarchic conspirators in this country, and we must stand united as one American people with Ukraine. The beautiful region of Sumy, home to a fellow Rice student and her family, is among Ukraine s hardest-hit regions. Incredibly, it is currently defended by armed civilians alone.

stanforddaily_2022_14,"Oh, the joyous season of applying to college! Scrambling to get one more letter of recommendation, fighting against the clock to submit an application before 11:59 p.m. and writing one final “Why me?” essay. It is a tedious process that I’m sure we all remember, and once you hit submit on your final application, you feel the greatest relief. Right now, the Class of 2027 is working on their college applications. Deadlines are flying by: Stanford’s restrictive early action application closed on Nov. 1. My experience with the college application process was bittersweet. Bitter — the process, with an absurd amount of time spent writing and editing essays while trying to keep up with my high school classwork. Sweet — the support I was fortunate enough to receive in order to represent myself properly in my applications. However, this support would not have been available to me if I had not looked for it. There are evident disparities in education. Not everyone obtains the same quality of education and not everyone has the same resources to advance their educational career. With many educational systems set up to keep students within the schools in their communities throughzip-code restrictions, students from under-resourced schools cannot attend a school with better resources outside their community. This is especially true for public schools that rely on funding from the government and local taxes. Within schools that have a more significant amount of funding, especially private schools, students often have greater access to higher education resources. For example, there may be more college counselors that can individually support students and have informational meetings with admissions officers from prestigious universities. However, schools with less funding often don’t even have a college counselor,only an academic counselorwho is meant to support achievement in high school. The lack of access to college application support maydeter studentsfrom applying to prestigious institutions despite being more than capable enough to succeed at these universities. However, free online resources give prospective students, especially low-income and first-generation students, information that they normally would not have access to. (Shoutout to my fellow FLI (first-generation, low-income and FLI-SO (first-generation, low-income, student orientation students at Stanford! As aUSC Bovard Scholar, I participated in a summer intensive before senior year, where I gained valuable information about the college application process. Additionally, I was paired with a coach with extensive experience in college admissions to help with my application. However, I would not have found or applied for this program without aYouTube video I watched during my sophomore year of high school, in which a previous Bovard Scholar documented their experience at the program. In addition to the support I received from USC Bovard Scholars, I also received support from online resources, such as college preparatory websites and content creators that focused on college admissions. YouTubers likeDomonique Cynthia, TikTokers likeGohar Khan, Instagram accounts like@firstgensupportand companies likeMarco Learningprovide free access to college admissions support. Even experience videos or campus tours can help students determine if they want to apply to a school without spending money to visit a college campus. The free support that the internet and social media can give students applying to college is astonishing. Resources developed by FLI students can be especially helpful for FLI applicants because the advice comes from a perspective they can relate to. Such resources can help students construct their college lists and understand the possible benefits of attending a private college rather than a public college, especially with regards to financial aid. The online community can also make students aware of organizations in the college admissions space that may not be worth your time or money. With college applications season going at full force right now, there is an influx of college admissions resources popping up all over the internet to guide students around the world as they apply to their dream schools. So, if you are a high school senior applying to college and happen to stumble across this article, I’ll leave you with a list of some of my favorite resources.

ubyssey_2022_27,"May 17, 2022 Written byDaphnée Lévesque According to its officialwebsite, SMART Recovery is an organization that aims to help people struggling with all types of addiction. I haven’t facilitated one of its meetings yet, but I’m currently completing their facilitator training. SMART Recovery is so unique and customizable to each community, allowing for differing ways of organizing meetings throughout the program. SMART stands for self-management and recovery training. The program offers mutual-support groups led by a facilitator and participants learn tools and strategies to help them manage addiction. Its ‘4-Point Program’ includes: It’s important to know that SMART Recovery uses an abstinence approach. This means that the goal is to refrain from all behaviours related to a person’s addiction. Some other programs use a moderation approach, which means that it is okay to engage in the behaviours from time to time, as long as it’s effective for the person in the moment. SMART is grounded in evidence-based therapies, including cognitive behaviour therapy, rational emotive behaviour therapy and motivational enhancement therapy. It is also important to mention that counsellors and therapists are not the only people who can be facilitators. Anyone who completes the SMART Recovery training can lead a meeting. Each meeting starts with a participant check in and an agenda is set. For example, the focus of a particular meeting might be to review the pros and cons of engaging in addictive behaviours. Or, for instance, another topic might be disputing irrational beliefs, which usually keep people in the addiction cycle. Each meeting also includes a group discussion. Participants help each other and focus on the idea that they are not powerless and can make changes in their lives. To find a meeting, visithttp: smartrecoverybc.com.

state_press_2022_18,"State Farm Stadium is pictured on Tuesday, March 15, 2023 in Glendale. Working in sports does not necessarily mean you have a job as a player, a coach or a journalist. There are many other opportunities to work at a professional sports stadium that are not necessarily “pretty jobs,” but they are jobs that are essential to the everyday operations of a stadium, such as concessions and parking attendants. This fall, ASU will offer a class that gives students a chance to see some of the other opportunities for stadium work during the season. The class,PRM 494/487: Arizona Cardinals Rotational Program, will place ASU students alongside employees in a real-life environment at the home of the Arizona Cardinals,State Farm Stadium, to give students a taste of what it actually feels like to work in a stadium on game day. The program was also offered in a limited capacity last fall, and students from ASU and other colleges around the Valley participated, according to Erin Schneiderman, a clinical assistant professor in theSchool of Community Resources and Developmentand instructor of the program. The students will be working for two vendors that are on-site,Insignia Event Services, which handles the parking operations at the stadium, andCraft Culinary Concepts, which handles the food and beverage services. Students will be paid $16 per hour for the hours they work, so it’s essentially like having a part-time job while you’re in class. “There really aren’t many classes outside of internships at ASU where you can earn college credits and be compensated, which is kind of a cool situation,” Schneiderman said. In the era of unpaid internships, which seem unfair and sketchy, this program is a dream for some college students who are struggling to get by. I know for myself, making $16 per hour would be amazing. Some people have rent, others have car payments and some just need extra money. For astruggling college student, the extra money could be the difference between being able to eat or not. This fall, ASU s special events management program is partnering with the Arizona Cardinals to teach students what it takes to put on a professional football game. The class will be open to all students and you can read more about the it athttps: t.co/jnp8zCTzmMpic.twitter.com/sL3bs4YZOH ASU should have more classes like this in other majors. It would be beneficial to have on-the-job training for any job a student chooses to do. It could be something like an upper-division class that only certain students have access to. This leads me to believe this class will lead to more opportunities for students from all backgrounds to get a job. This class is a foolproof way to try out a job, and if you don’t like it, you can try something else. For a lot of people,finding a jobafter college is a problem. This class is an amazing way to gain experience in order to get a job and stick with it after graduation. “Students will learn critical event management components, they will know what it’s like to be a part of a team … and they will leave this class with a lot of knowledge about what it takes to plan mega-events, sporting events, events inside large venues, and I believe they’ll have the tools to continue moving forward whether it’s with this organization or with others,” Schneiderman said. Those are all skills that can translate to any field students wish to work in, and with experience in the entertainment management field, students could work from day one when they graduate college. This partnership not only benefits the vendors that are hiring these ASU students, but it benefits the students who are struggling to try to find work. That is truly innovative.

crimson_2022_68,"For most Black people, February 27th is fairly insignificant, simply marking the second-to-last day of Black History Month. For me, it wholly defines my experience with Blackness. In a way, it is fitting (although purely coincidental that Dominican Independence Day is celebrated as Black History Month comes to a close, as for most of my life, I felt that I existed on the fringes of Blackness. The tensions between my Dominican-Hispanic and Black identities prevented me from feeling secure in my Blackness, even as my skin complexion made it unequivocally clear to everyone around me. My Spanish-speaking household did not seem to fall in line with the stories we learned in school about Black History Month, so I naturally felt that February was intended to commemorate a history that I could not claim as my own. Despite Latin America being home to the largest Black population outside of Africa, this side of history was completely excluded from my curriculum. No evidence around me proved that being Black and Hispanic could coexist, and thus, I was forced to choose. As a child, I subconsciously chose the latter. I chose to detach myself from the Black identity not because I did not like my physical features, but because I had internalized a singular form of Blackness that I was unable to perfectly fit. I have always been called “morena” and “prieta” — both terms referencing my dark skin — by fellow Dominicans. I never questioned or objected to these names, but somehow I did not equate them with Blackness. I was confined in the interstitial state of knowing I was Black but being unable to use the term to describe my identity. For years, I clung to Latina, Hispanic, or simply Dominican. I was forced to contend with my dormant identity crisis in high school when I began attending a predominantly white institution for the first time. At a school where few faces resembled mine, it was impossible for me to push my Blackness aside when “Black” encompassed the extent of what I was deemed by others. The conflicting identities that I had suppressed until then were unexpectedly brought to the forefront, and I realized that in a country where race inevitably governs how we navigate the spaces we inhabit, refraining from acknowledging my Blackness was not an option. History and society dictated the choice that I previously believed I had the freedom to make within the comfort of my sheltered childhood. More disconcerting, however, was the realization that I was doing myself the same disservice as those around me — stripping my identity of the nuance it possesses. Finding myself unable to place “Black” and “Latina” together in a neatly packaged box, I felt the need to simplify my identity. As I began to actively think about my Blackness for the first time in my life, my immediate response was self-resentment. I was overcome with the agonizing feeling that I had renounced the right to claim my Black identity after failing to do so for so long. However, as I examined the origins of my denial, I realized that my experience was demonstrative of a very prevalent phenomenon in the Dominican Republic. Historically, the Dominican state has fostered a systematic erasure of Blackness from the DR’s national identity, directly linked to the strong anti-Haitian sentiment that characterizes the sociopolitical climate in the nation. Despite having gained independence from Spain for the second time in 1865, the Dominican Republic recognizes February 27, 1844 — the day the nation drove the Haitian army out of Santo Domingo — as its official day of independence. This decision precisely encapsulates the disconnect from my Blackness that has dominated my unsettling sense of self. The founding of the DR as an independent nation was predicated upon a fundamentally antagonistic relationship with our predominantly Black Haitian neighbors, and in turn, a proximity to the white Spanish colonizer. Further, an indoctrination campaign most potent during the military dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo perpetuated the racist and colorist claim that it is impossible to be both Black and Dominican without devaluing the latter. Realizing that I was simply another victim of the systemic anti-Blackness that pervades the DR, I stopped vilifying myself for discounting my Blackness. My distance from the Caribbean nation has allowed me to recognize that my Spanish-speaking household does not at all change how I fundamentally navigate life in a Black body in the United States. This experience is what I have come to conclude is at the core of Afro-Latinidad. The term Afro-Latina seems to have devolved into somewhat of a buzzword, but for me it is deeply significant. Embracing Afro-Latinidad liberates me from having to choose between aspects of my identity that I formerly believed to be mutually exclusive, as it allows me to feel secure in the fact that neither side of my racial and ethnic identity detracts from the other. Existing at the intersection of Black and Hispanic no longer produces the feeling of internal competition that I spent years attempting to expel. Afro-Latinidad has afforded me the opportunity for reconciliation that I needed to finally subdue the tensions between Black History Month and Dominican Independence Day. Ericka S. Familia ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Greenough Hall. This piece is a part of a focus on Black authors and experiences for Black History Month."

The news came to me late at night from my pre-frosh friend texting on our group chat: “Hey guys sorry for late text but heard about what happened near wilbur hope you guys are feeling alright its hella scary and infuriating.” Earlier that day, Aug. 9, Stanford had sent a “Community Crime Alert”notificationregarding a sexual assault, in broad daylight at 5 p.m., in a parking lot near Wilbur Hall. I received this notification while I was caught up in some work, and I’d heard so many rape stories recently that I momentarily forgot to even react to this one. Only when I read my friend’s text did I manage to snap back to reality, conjuring up enough emotion to respond to her. There was a time when I myself had the emotional capacity to talk about rape every single time it happened, but that was before I’d run my tired mind through the grieving process over and over again, alongside almost every single one of my closest friends. That was back when thestatisticof sexual assault – namely, that one out of every six American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime – was just a statistic, instead of points on a dot plot of familiar faces that were slowly, bravely emerging from the obscurity. Nowadays, it feels like a new face emerges on the graph every week, revealing itself to me in hushed whispers on Roble Field, becoming another speck in this constellation connecting us all. The poet Phil Kaye oncesaid: “My mother taught me this trick. If you repeat something over and over again, it loses its meaning. Homework, homework, homework, homework, homework, homework. See? Nothing.” Imagine a carousel of women, their eyes all peering into yours, hoping that you’ll trust them with what they’re about to say. One after the other, their stories echo through you as the carousel of your days spins: “I was assaulted on the bus.” “He kissed me when I told him not to.” “My uncle touched me when I was younger.” Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, see? Nothing. This summer, there have been two reported sexual assault cases on Stanford campus. Which means two Community Crime notifications, the second hot on the heels of the first and sparking outrage on Stanford’sFizz app, prompting my male friends to text me to offer support, and my RAs to send out mass emails. I don’t assume that anything that we say can match up to the heavy task of alleviating the victim’s burden, and it is extremely difficult to find the right words to say when trying to offer sympathy. But by acknowledging and talking about it, we can, at least, help each other process it. Every time we talk about it, we are sending out a reminder that sexual assault happens, and it happens far more often than we’d like to think. It is an extremely ugly feeling to hear of a sexual assault and not have the emotional capacity to respond with anger, as was the case with me when I first heard about theAug. 9 rape case. “Minimization”, or ignoring the impact of the trauma in order to make the traumatic experience appear smaller than it really is, is one of the keycoping mechanismsfor trauma, after all. It is an unhealthy, but effective, mechanism to apply to get you through the oft-misogynisticparts of Stanfordfrat culture, hearing heartbreakingnarrativesfrom ex-Stanford students assaulted by their professors, and orientation at a University that invitesauthorsto speak about its rape culture but cannot promise its students a college experience free from its repercussions. But now I am remedying my mistake; all my pent-up emotion is boiling over into this piece – all the accumulated trauma spilling like ink onto this page. The reported rape from Aug. 9 felt like a last straw for me, catalyzing me to write this article and express my anxiety after a summer of learning to numb my senses. The truth is that many more assaults happen than are ever reported. This summer alone, between the two reported crimes, I’ve had multiple friends tell me about their experiences with sexual assault. None of them decided to report it, for the same reasons that63% of sexual assaults go unreported. For survivors of sexual assault, it is mentally challenging to conjure up the details of a rape for the purposes of a criminal investigation; even once they do so, there is always the fear that they will not be believed. In the introductory chapter of Chanel Miller’s book,Know My Name, there is a poignant paragraph that elucidates this well as she recounts her experience with the criminal justice system after reporting a sexual assault on Stanford campus:“Would you like to press charges?He said.What does that mean?I asked.… I didn’t know this littleyeswould reopen my body, would rub the cuts wrong, would pry my legs open for the public… my three-letter word that morning unlocked a future, one in which I would become twenty-three and twenty-four and twenty-five and twenty-six before the case would be closed.” Miller’s words are chilling, and her story is a testament to the fact that for sexual assault victims, the uphill battle to getting justice can be traumatic in and of itself, perhaps even measuring up to the trauma of the assault itself. In Miller’s case, her attacker was a stranger. Butstudieshave found that perpetrators of sexual violence are usually acquaintances of the victim: members of one’s social group who may be well-liked by others and thus make it hard for a victim to speak out against them, fearing their word would not be believed against the attacker’s. This is a situation that I know all too well, having been in it myself. This fear of being perceived as a “liar,” in fact, pervades every stage of the redressal process for sexual assault victims, withresearchshowing that in 49 out of 50 reported rapes in the United States, the assailant goes free – even though, as shown inthis studyby the National Sexual Violence Resource Centre, only 5-10% of reported rapes are false accusations. A 2019 Atlanticpiecebrilliantly phrased this phenomenon as “The Epidemic of Disbelief.” The psychological challenge of reliving the experience through an investigation, coupled with the statistical unlikeliness that the investigation will bring justice to the victim, are two of the biggest reasons assaults go unreported. But just because you don’t get a Clery Act notification every time it happens, doesn’t mean they aren’t happening –every 68 seconds another American is sexually assaulted.Estimatesfind that somewhere between 19% and 27% of college women and 6–8% of college men are sexually assaulted during their time in college. Though we do not have Stanford-specific data on this, we can, both rationally and anecdotally, assume that Stanford undergraduates fare no better than the national estimate. Assault, assault, assault, assault, assault, assault, see? Nothing. Toward the middle of my freshman year, I started hearing stories about the men with ‘bad reputations,’ the ones who are rumored to have sexual assault cases to their name. Every time I hear a new story, I am shocked to realize how freely such dangerous people get to move around campus: living in our dorms, taking our classes, sitting with us at the dining hall. I wouldn’t have known that most of them are dangerous at all, were it not through my friends’ worried word-of-mouth. These assaulters’ unencumbered presence signals the omnipresence ofrape culture on Stanford campus, and is a constant reminder to stay vigilant. I am writing this Opinion piece because, just a day before the Tuesday rapereportwas released, I was telling my male best friend that I feel constantly afraid for my safety at parties. He said in response that he thinks it is irrational for me to be scared in a public place, becausewhat’s the worst that can happen? I offered to walk one of my friends home from my dorm room when she was leaving at night, not wanting her to walk home alone, but she declined, saying:what’s the worst that can happen? Meanwhile, all the men whom we fear bumping into at parties, or while walking home at night, feel free to treat women as badly as they please. Because they know, realistically,what’s the worst that can happen? Well, now the two friends I mentioned know the worst thing that could have happened. All the dangerous men I know are still as protected by their privilege as they always have been. So I can tell you the story of the girl who never reported her rape, because she was scared her parents would find out about it and restrict her activities in the name of safety. I can tell you the story of the girl who did, and her family still receives threats from the family of the assailant, passionate emails from a mother who refuses to believe her beloved son would think of harming a woman. In both of these stories, there exist parents going to extreme lengths to protect their children. In both of these stories, the rape victim receives the brunt of the blame. Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape. I almost didn’t write this piece, because wasn’t there an Opinion piece about sexual assault published in The Daily just last month? Is it too repetitive to talk about it again and again, and will it somehow lose its meaning if it is discussed too much? I caught myself wondering, do I talk about, think about rape too much? But what is “too much?” And is this constant “rape anxiety” not a core tenet of womanhood? If sexual assault happens as often as it does, of course it needs to be discussed more. The Daily needs to be a place where such dialogue can be freely exchanged, because there are far too many places where rape jokes are more normalized than sexual assault prevention measures. Because too many people still don’t understand the pervasiveness ofrape culture on this campusand oncollege campuses all over. Because all my well-intentioned male friends who sent out scared texts after the rape report have no idea how many other rape cases they never hear about. Because every rape story deserves thoughtful dialogue and gentle reporting. And if I was scared of being “annoying” by talking about rape again, I realized what a privilege it is for anyone to be annoyed by accounts of rape, rather than relating to them.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_30,"Earlier this week, the comedian, actress and entertainer known as Awkwafinaissued a public apology to her Twitterand announced her exit from the platform in an apparent preemptive self-cancelation. Another one bites the dust, as they say. The entertainer, whose real name is Nora Lum, was once a celebrated public figure and one of Hollywood’s most well-known ambassadors from the Asian American community, having won the Golden Globe for Best Actress for her leading role in “The Farewell” just two years ago. Though well-known for her comedic roles in movies such as “Ocean’s 8” and “Crazy Rich Asians,” 2020 marked Lum’s pursuit of slightly more serious roles and projects. But many still remember her as the entertainer whose shtick was using a “blaccent,” or African American Vernacular English (AAVE . That hasn’t been forgiven despite her recent departure from this particular brand of “comedy.” The persona Lum embodied was indeed cringeworthy. Her use of Black slang and annunciation was certainly gratuitous, full of AAVE phrases like “gon’ be” and words with missing vowels. However, this type of spoken and written affect proliferates the internet — especially among millennials and Gen Z — so that it seems as though it belongs to everyone. Theconversationaround cultural appropriation versus appreciation is a heated one and brings into question whetherLum’s backgroundfrom Queens, NY and her love of hip-hop justifies her cooptation of Black aesthetics. Perhaps the answer is a resounding “no.” But there seems to be a conflation of poor judgment with actual harm. Nowadays, we place such a premium on feelings, yet at the same time, we are quick to destroy a person’s career for mistakes from which they could easily learn. We should all know by now that making a name for oneself by imitating “Blackness” isn’t a great look. However, this apologizing and litigation of whether the apology was good enough are totally unnecessary and absurd. Raking Lum over the coals for her indiscretions probably won’t result in her being shunned or blacklisted from the film industry — though she will probably need a bit of time to recover until “cancel culture” claims its newest victim. In the meantime, she is handing the reins of her account over to her trusted team of social media professionals until 2024, according to her Twitter bio. In her statement of regrets — a tweet containing multiple screenshots of a draft from her Notes app — Lum seemed to followthe usual celebrity apology script, vowing to “listen and work tirelessly” to do better. This meticulously crafted, PR-approved wording that celebrities seem to always adopt in the wake of scandal is almost more nauseating than their supposed offense. At some point, we have to ask whether this culture of apology is really productive or in service to anyone. She might as well just apologize for simply being unfunny. pic.twitter.com/pxSLXZD2J0 Our most primitive and vengeful human instincts tend to reveal themselves in these public shamings, which have grown increasingly common. They are the modern equivalent to colonial practices ofpunishmentinvolving tarring and feathering. Social media has become the proverbial town square — rather than dousing the offender in tar and forcing them to roll around in feathers, the woke mob’s method of humiliation involves backing their victim into a virtual corner until an apology is issued, each word is subsequently picked apart and the whole thing is rejected. It signifies the implosion of a career and a complete loss of self-respect. While less of a literal mess, it is arguably just as undignified. As celebrities and public figures grovel for forgiveness in a particularly merciless and hypocritical social climate, it often feels as though their public displays of remorse should have just stayed in the drafts. The best thing Lum could have done in this scenario was to simply not engage with or pay lip service to bloodthirsty, anonymous Twitter users. Once a concession is made, it opens the floodgates for even more ridicule. No apology is ever going to appease the social media mob.

wildcat_arizona_2022_56,"The sidewalk between the University of Arizona’s Student Union Memorial Center and the UA Mall on Aug. 10, 2020. Both in-state and out-of-state students will love UArizona’s beautiful campus. Searching for colleges during my junior and senior years of high school brought me to look at out-of-state colleges, including the University of Arizona. Some of the things I was looking for in colleges were scholarship opportunities, clubs, internships/research opportunities, location and overall cost. Looking at the UA, I found everything I was looking for in a college. I received multiple scholarships to the point where it was cheaper to go here than remain in-state. There were over600 clubs and organizationsto choose from,easy waysto get internships and jobs on campus and a beautiful campus that was my cheapest option for a college. The first week on campus was fantastic. There were so many events for incoming first-year students and other years. The atmosphere was unreal, and I was excited for the coming semesters. Something that I enjoyed was the sporting events. Going to football games in the fall was so much fun, and the camaraderie of everyone inZonaZoowas phenomenal. Even though the football season did not turn out as we hoped it would, it was still entertaining. The basketball games in the spring turned the campus into a frenzy; game days are taken seriously at the UA. I loved how many clubs and organizations there are and how there were fairs to show off all the different ones the UA had to offer. Joining any of them provides connections to people you would have never met if it were not for the club. I wish I had joined more my first year because I frequently got bored once I was done with homework and classes. Since I’m not from Arizona and I didn’t know anybody else going to the UA, I was scared that it would be hard to make friends, but it was super easy. I made a lot of friends in my dorm and my classes. I was pretty shy going into college, but it was a new experience for everyone, so I felt less alone. One thing I wish I would have done more was go out more and talk to more people in my classes. RELATED:GUEST LETTER: Words of wisdom for incoming freshmen from the UA Bobcats Senior Honorary I “toured” the UA in the spring of 2021 and walked around campus without a tour guide because they were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I wish I could have had someone show me the campus because I got lost a couple of times during the first couple of weeks and did not know how theon-campus dining optionsworked. The UA has the Global Center, the Student Union Memorial Center and Honors Village residence hall for food, and that’s about it on campus. The Student Union mainly has fast food, and I got sick of it within the first month. The Global Center has delicious food, but it was a far walk from my dorm. The Honors Village had a buffet and was more like the dining halls I had seen in movies. It had great food, but it was expensive and is far from the rest of campus. I had purchased a meal plan but had to rush to spend all of the money because it expires at the end of the academic year, and I had been going to the store to buy all the food I would eat throughout the week. I wish I had researched more about the food options, especially the meal plans, before purchasing the one I used. I would advise incoming first-year students to go to the sporting events and purchase the ZonaZoo pass so you can always go to the football and basketball games. Talk to everyone around you in your classes because if you miss a day, you can text them so you can know what you missed. Keep your room door open in the first week so people can say hi to you. Explore the campus to find the best places you can hang out between classes and have places to study besides your room. If you dislike the course or the professor, you should drop the class because attending a class you dislike will be challenging. Go to your professor’s office hours; even if you do not need help, you can still go and connect with your professors. Having only one year of college under my belt, I can say that it was one of the best years of my life. I am glad I got to experience a new town on my own and meet some of my best friends. It was hard not being with my family or friends, but it was worth it. Choosing the University of Arizona was the best decision I could have made.

crimson_2022_87,"Harvard must reevaluate its undergraduate dining program. The College’s single, unlimited dining plan is restrictive, inflexible, and unreasonable — in terms of both organization and price. The pandemic has highlighted these shortcomings of undergraduate dining at Harvard, while at the same time presenting an opportunity to implement positive changes. Of the 98 percent of undergraduate students who live on campus, all must subscribe to the $7,236 mandatory meal plan. In a standard school year, this amounts to a minimum of about $33.50 a day — students who get to school later or whose finals end earlier could end up paying more than $36. This dining program is nothing short of an exploitative monopoly. Because an off-campus community is lacking, freshmen are ordinarily required to live on campus, and social life is centered around the on-campus experience. Students have no choice but to pay. The College says it requires the unlimited meal plan tofostera central community experience within each House. But community through dining can be nurtured without charging for 21 meals a week — especially since many students don’t sit for every meal in the dining hall anyways. In the mornings, many students stop by only for a quick bite at breakfast or skip the meal altogether. According to Harvard University Dining Services, only 40 percent of students attend breakfast. Similarly, during lunchtime, returning to their own house isn’t possible for all students. Students with tight schedules and those who live in the Quad or in houses with shorter lunch windows might have no other choice than to eat out. And for dinner, students often want to catch up with friends. Even if they want to use a meal swipe, interhouse dining isrestrictive, and some houses ban first-years entirely. The rigid dining plan can force bonding with friends outside your house to happen outside of campus altogether — and cost money. Because Harvard operates what is effectively a monopoly on dining, there is little students can do to control their dining experience. Students have been left at the College’s often nonsensical whims during the pandemic. During the 2020 fall semester, when the per diem rate was as high as $42 because of reduced time on campus, dining halls operated with a limited menu. Hot food was not served until mid-October. Breakfast was served cold throughout the semester. Moreover, food could not be eaten in the dining hall, so many meals were taken in students’ suites (or worse, singles . Besides the pandemic, other atypical situations have left many Harvard students hungry and out of home. Last fall, Adams House dining hall wasclosedfor two weeks because of a fruit fly infestation. There’s no saying what dining restrictions the future may hold, either. During the first two weeks of this semester, all dining halls were available only for grab-and-go as students traveled back to campus. New variants or other unexpected circumstances could send students back to grab-and-go meals, while restaurants around campus remain open. Creating community is not a sufficient reason to require a universal, complete meal plan at today’s Harvard, where pandemic-related disruptions have laid bare the monopolistic nature of the College’s dining program. A more flexible plan, where students are given a required floor fee of 10 or so weekly meals, would allow students greater freedom while still encouraging bonding within their house or Annenberg, the freshman dining hall. Alternatively, if such a program proved too volatile, the College couldofferthose living on campus the same arrangement they do to off-campus students: a choice between plans of five, 10, or all 21 meals per week. Moreover, when students who receive financial aid eat out, they could be reimbursed at a rate tied to their level of aid and the cost of a meal swipe. Students of all financial backgrounds would then be free to choose when, where, and how their money would be spent. While we should all be grateful for the hard work and enthusiasm of our HUDS employees, students should not be forced to either dine in their own houses or effectively pay a fee each time they venture outside their house to grab a meal with friends. The dining program is unnecessary to its goal of fostering community at Harvard and monopolistic in nature. It must go. Kanishka J.

stanforddaily_2022_125,"—Edward S. Mocarski, microbiology and immunology professor emeritus at Stanford University and Robert W. Woodruff Professor of Microbiology & Immunology at Emory University Policy wonks at Hoover Institution understand that our country has laws that enforce widely accepted moral standards as well as ethical standards that have long applied to research, defining research integrity. There is little question that an action may be legal but unethical or illegal but ethical. Ethical principles are used to criticize, guide and interpret laws. Thus, laws and ethics remain separated by an enormous gray zone. This ambiguity set the stage for policy proposals in the form of a pamphlet (Eyes Wide Open: Ethical Risks in Research Collaboration with China and discussion (Eyes Wide Open: Ethical Risks In Research Collaboration With China orchestrated by Hoover affiliates Glenn Tiffert and Jeff Stoff. As the title suggests, the pamphlet proposes ways to address potential risks of academic research at the international level, particularly involving Chinese institutions. This Hoover initiative asks research institutions and governments outside China everywhere to “revise existing concepts of research integrity to ensure consistency with democratic values and define a common standard or set of conditions for ethical reviews of research that considers legal and political context and ethical and human rights risks”. The proposal goes further and suggests that “Federal agencies should deny or remove funding for research projects that involve collaboration with entities, based in authoritarian nations, that support mass surveillance and human rights abuses.” The recommendations includeplacingsuspected foreign entities that have collaborated with US scientists on “the Entity List for export controls,” preventing scientific collaboration that has been deemed “contrary to U.S. national security and/or foreign policy interests”. While weapons and intelligence research are clearly accompanied by national security risks, the Hoover initiative seeks an extremely broad application. Were it not for this proposal coming on the coattails of some pretty mean spirited, anti-China rhetoric and growing levels of legal proceedings involving US-based academic researchers who have little connection to weapons or intelligence research, the situation might be worth a hearty debate. The fact of the matter is that the FBI has alreadyinvestigateda large number of academic researchers as a result of US Justice Department concerns over espionage and trade secret theft by China. The FBI round-up included both Chinese scientists, whether or not they were US citizens, permanent residents or scientists, as well as non-Chinese scientists with research links to Chinese institutions and scientists. There is little question that these events cast a pall over further collaboration between US scientists with researchers in Chinese institutions, no matter the topic of research involved, that neutralized any semblance of healthy scientific discourse prior to 2020. In a fashion that at one swoop both shocks and astounds, this Hoover initiative plans to formalize a form of “Thought Police” first imaged as an authoritarian tool, but here proposed for a free society. While they seek a kind of insular benefit on the surface, the proposal reveals a general overstepping as well as a lack of understanding of “research integrity” as generally accepted. The authors have clearly not taken the time to comprehendcurrent standardsof research ethics, research compliance and research objectivity despite widely accessible summaries. Examples given in the proposal are jarring in their own right. For example, the Hoover proposal makes the unfortunate comparison between ethical review of research that would involve scientists within authoritarian regimes and ethical review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB as currently exists in most academic institutions including Stanford. An IRB, of course, is responsible for reviewing and approving studies that focus on human subjects, mostly with the goal of assuring protections to study participants. Such research compliance affects most direct research into human disease and disease intervention. Importantly, IRB guidelines are not currently even applicable to US State Department and US Department of Defense human subjects research (which conforms to a different policy – proscribed in DOD INSTRUCTION 3216.02 . Nevertheless, the Hoover Institution authors together with additional discussantsuniformly stand in support of creating “civil society institutions” or “coalitions” that would “work together to develop knowledge and promote robust due diligence and information sharing on suspect entities based in authoritarian nations in order to uphold ethical standards and protect human rights”. As any experienced academic scientist would attest, science pursuits and research proposals already involve a defined scope of work as well as extensive peer review. The future of science relies on imagination and so what scientists think drives progress and discovery. For my entire research career of over 40 years, scientific progress has depended on international collaboration and peer review that has not been readily identifiable with a single institution, nation or sponsoring agency, and certainly not restricted to a particular form of government. It must be acknowledged that China’s rapid rise in the scientific world comes in direct proportion to their growing investment. The way to counter their stratospheric rise is to match their investment. We should work to retain top research trainees in the US. We have not come close to keeping pace with Chinese spending on research and are now observing the consequences. Nearly all scientific scholarship, whether it is conducted in a democratic nation or under an authoritarian regime, undergoes thorough peer review both before initiation and after execution. The scientific community knows no borders. Nation-based funding agencies may rely on their own scientists for peer review but international peer review has grown with the emergence of private nonprofit sponsors such as the Wellcome Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as many others. International peer review across a worldwide community drives both objectivity and completeness. Peer review of published research results relies on an ever-more open, international peer review process with reviewers from wherever expertise in the topic exists in the world. Peer review is widely acclaimed for sustaining good science and applications of science that benefit humanity. Examples in the Hoover pamphlet and discussion focus on artificial intelligence (AI research that facilitates surveillance by an authoritarian regime. Such examples do not apply to typical scientific collaborations. Besides, any algorithm supporting video surveillance of facial features overlooked by our huge federal intelligence infrastructure says more about the competency of the intelligence activities than anything about ethics. Where most international collaborations in science are pursued without military relevance, international collaboration that involves weapons and intelligence research clearly sits in a different place. Improvements in weapons and intelligence gathering have direct military application. Collaborations in such sensitive areas already undergo direct scrutiny by federal regulations and interventions. Although fairness, research integrity and human rights guarantees are all desirable ends, it is hard to see ”civil society institutions” adding any benefit. Although so obvious to the concerned observer such as myself, the importance and focus of competent, extant intelligence activities was completely overlooked by the Hoover discussion group. Instead, discussants came across uniformly supporting the creation of new, novel national or even international initiatives aimed at regulating international research collaborations with the intent of stopping those that might yield benefits to “authoritarian regimes”, such as China. An overwhelming majority of research collaborations fall far from potential espionage, so in actuality this promises to become an agent of politics and nothing more. Although Hoover clearly navigates in its own waters and promotes policies with political nuance, it remains unclear whether the pamphlet co-authored by Drs. Tiffert and Stoff was even peer-reviewed by experts with broad knowledge of the topic. This policy initiative should die on the vine before a lot more innocent academic scientists have their careers ruined by conjecture and misdirected federal intrusion.

stanforddaily_2022_55,"Thom Hersbach is a postdoctoral scholar at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. He writes on behalf of theCoalition for a True School of Sustainability; the statements in this article are personal opinions and do not reflect the official views of the US Department of Energy or Stanford University. Stanford recentlyannouncedthe launch of the Doerr School of Sustainability. Despite receiving founding gifts totaling $1.7 billion, the school’s incoming dean hasindicated thatthe school would still work with and accept funding from fossil fuel companies. This openness to fossil fuel funding is not hypothetical: the Doerr School iscurrently slated to absorbnumerous fossil fuel-funded programs currently housed in the Stanford School of Earth. Such funding poses serious reputational risks to Stanford and the Doerr School, which mighthave its name usedto promote climate denial, greenwashing and policies that delay climate action. In response to this criticism, Dean Arun Majumdarelaboratedthat climate change requires an “all hands on deck approach.” Although this approach might appear reasonable, it would be prudent to verify whether fossil fuel companies are indeed honest deckhands or, instead, mutineers. After all, fossil fuel producershave knownabout fossil-derived CO2emissionssince the 1950s, and have denied or downplayed climate changesince 1980. In fact, the industry has used Stanford’s name tosuggestthat fossil fuels are essential to sustain growth while avoiding economic disaster. Furthermore, in 2006, then-CEO of ExxonMobil Rex Tillersoncited a $100 million contribution to Stanford’s Global Climate and Energy Projectas evidence that the company is investing in renewable research, while ExxonMobil alsotold investorsit would dedicate 1000 times more funds over the same time period to searching for new oil and gas reserves. These seven decades of history are not lost on Dean Majumdar, whoproposes asking four questionsto suss out potential bad actors. In this article, we will answer these questions for Stanford’s fossil fuel partners in order to further our shared goal of a truly sustainable Doerr School. According to theCoalition for a True School of Sustainability, the University’s known fossil fuel partners include: BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, EcoPetrol, Eni, Equinor, ExxonMobil, JX Nippon (since 2020: ENEOS , Occidental, Petrobras, PetroChina, Phillips 66, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell, SK Energy and Total. For simplicity, we will refer to these companies as Stanford’s “Partners.” Stanfordalso engages withthe American Petroleum Institute, a national oil and gas trade association, as well asseveral other fossil-related firmsnot included here. Wherever possible, we will characterize Stanford’s fossil-fuel Partners individually toavoid painting the entire industry with the same brush. This approach aligns with Stanford’s Board of Trustees2020 commitment to the Paris Agreement: the Board eschews blanket fossil divestments, instead encouraging a case-by-case evaluation. With this in mind, we can address Dean Majumdar’s four questions. 1.Are a Partner’s commitments aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement? TheParis Agreementaims to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to stay below 1.5 °C. Stanford’s fossil Partners do not appear to be committed to these goals: a2021 paperin the journalScienceanalyzed Stanford’s aforementioned Partners, concluding that only Occidental Petroleum comes close to meeting the Paris Goals. These findings are supported byThe GuardianandOil Change International. Notably, Oil Change International found the climate pledges and plans of eight Stanford Partners to be “grossly insufficient.” 2.Is a Partner devoting sufficient human and financial resources to meet its commitments? To reiterate, most of Stanford’s Partners’ commitments do not align with Paris goals. For these companies, any devoted human and financial resources are therefore insufficient by default. This point is underscored byClimate Action 100+, which judges none of Stanford’s Partners Capital Alignment as ‘aligned’.A 2022 scientific studyreproduces these conclusions for BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell, stating that none of these companies are “currently on the way to a clean energy transition.” 3.Is a Partner supporting and promoting government policy that would create the business imperative for a transition to a clean economy? To answer this question, it would be easy to cherry pick negative examples of fossil-fuel lobbying. This would seemingly disqualify ExxonMobil forlobbyingagainst the European Union’s CO2vehicle standards, and Shell, BP, Equinor and Total forpromoting fossil gasin Europe: these obstructive actionsconflict with Dean Majumdar’s personal beliefs. However, it might be more objective to judge companies for their overall lobbying behavior. To this end,LobbyMaplists the lobbying behavior of Stanford’s fossil fuel Partners. It finds most of these Partners to obstruct climate policy and five Partners to express mixed positions. Notably, LobbyMap considers the American Petroleum Institute to be “broadly hostile to climate policy in the US.” The Institute counts multiple Stanford Partners among itsmembers. Furthermore,according to Dean Majumdar, a company sometimes needs to “produce oil and gas to avoid significant disruptions to human welfare, the economy and national security in the short term.” In this case, one should ask: 4. Does it still intend to meet its climate commitments in the long term? Here, Dean Majumdar suggests that exceptional circumstances might justify temporarily increased fossil fuel production if producers still commit to long-term climate goals. Evaluating this question, we can assess how fossil fuel companies act during the Covid-19 pandemic or Russia’s (#3 global oil producer invasion of Ukraine. According toInfluence Map, the American Petroleum Institute has usedbothcrisesto lobby for rolling back existing or planned climate policy standards: these are not good signs. Overall, it appears like Dean Majumdar’squestionshave no positive answers. This is not to say that no well-intentioned people work at or with Stanford’s fossil fuel Partners: we personally know many such people. However, we must also recognize that the overall behavior of Stanford’s Partners appears inconsistent with Dean Majumdar’s criteria and the Board of Trustees’ commitments to the Paris Agreement. If Stanford engages with these Partners at an institutional level, it should therefore consider the risks. Should Stanford expose itself to whatresearchers describeas greenwashing and ideological climate denialism? Does Stanford intend to help fossil-fuel companiesexplore unconventional oil, even though the IEAdeems further oil exploration incompatiblewith net-zero goals? Both Stanford and the Doerr School should weigh these questions carefully. In summary, the research cited here suggests that Stanford’s current fossil-fuel Partners do not even remotely match Dean Majumdar’s criteria and the Board of Trustees’ Paris commitment.

crimson_2022_91,"I joined the Citizens’ Assembly, a body of Harvard students tasked with writing a new constitution for Harvard College’s student government, because I want our elected officials to better represent us. Under the Harvard Undergraduate Association, the system proposed to replace the Undergraduate Council, student government at Harvard would be reduced in size to nine elected officers tasked with advocating directly to the administration, complemented by a number of volunteers under officer direction. However, problems inherent to the structure of the Citizens’ Assembly have created a situation where the changes proposed in the new HUA constitution only worsen many of the current problems with the UC. Improving a deeply flawed student government is a noble goal. It is one that should be pursued at length, not over the course of 11 short meetings by a body whose diversity isquestionable. With the pressure of an impending deadline amid the ongoing challenges of academic life, there was not enough time for members of the Citizens’ Assembly to adequately learn about different forms of government before finalizing a replacement constitution. During the brainstorming period, only three members of the Citizens’ Assembly attended a Zoom briefing that had been set up with experts in the field of governance, and when the Citizens’ Assembly decided upon the form of governance to proceed with, after seriously considering just two structures, only 19 out of the 30 original members were present and voted. The problems with the HUA are not the fault of any members of the Citizens’ Assembly; rather, they are the fault of naivety with regards to how long the process of developing a new student government would realistically take. As a result of these limitations in the brainstorming process, the HUA fails to resolve the main flaws of the current UC. While a recent professional investigationcleared the UCof financial mismanagement, which was previously one of the primary allegations of its incompetence, the main remaining problem with the UC — representative in-fighting and resulting ineffectiveness — is not properly addressed by the proposed HUA. UC members in-fight because they disagree over policy for valid reasons; however, these disagreements often become the focus of attention rather than the problem that students are trying to solve. This can create a destructive cycle that leads some towalk away from the UCand others to wish to replace the whole system. The HUA does not limit this in-fighting; instead, its structure actually promotes conflict through the creation of territoriality. The HUA has a system of seven elected officers — led by two co-presidents — split into seven teams, each tasked with a somewhat different mission. This means that issues which don’t fall neatly into these seven categories are less likely to receive targeted attention. For example, because important missions like diversity, equity, and inclusion are present in all aspects of student life represented by the Finance, Social Life, Extracurricular, Academic, Residential Life, and Sports Teams, responsibility to deal with these initiatives will be ultimately split, even if the proposed constitution attempts to confine them all to the Well-being Officer. DEI issues are abundant on campus, and I can foresee valid and substantial disagreement about which team is supposed to deal with problems that arise, not to mention the conflicting opinions that each of the nine individual officers may have on solutions. In a worst-case scenario, the HUA could advocate to the Harvard administration up to eight conflicting solutions to one inter-team problem. While there are band-aid solutions to these types of conflicts, such as requiring all officers to vote on each’s activities, doing so would simply turn the HUA into a nine-person UC. As each officer is tasked with working within their own territory, and has their own discretionary budget, the HUA is a situation primed for the wasting of student time and money. Under the HUA, each team also consists of a number of volunteers who can contribute their thoughts in advocating to the administration. However, these volunteers do not save the HUA from the dangers of giving too much authority to a small group of individuals, as the new constitution does not establish a minimum number of volunteers that must be present before a team’s decision is made. Worse still, as the HUA’s main guideline on transparency is “some records,” officers could largely avoid accountability to the student body. The issues facing Harvard College — such as DEI, Shopping Week, andcampus dining— do not fit neatly into the boxes of the HUA teams. By proposing a system of government which divides itself among these categories and gives ultimate authority to only nine officers, the HUA is set up to produce conflict that would do nothing to serve the interests of students. Legitimate disagreement over policy is a fact of our student body, so any system of government must manage this disagreement internally. A government which cannot act in unity does not foster consensus or create a positive image. The HUA does nothing to systematically solve the issues of ineffectiveness within the UC. Rather, the HUA would bare its disagreements publicly to the Harvard administration through multiple competing policy proposals, making the consequences much more damaging to the student body. If the members of the HUA all worked together in unity, then it would be an effective organization to advocate on behalf of the students — but if this kind of ideal harmony were even attainable, the UC would also effectively advocate on behalf of the students. Knowing this reality, we cannot evaluate the HUA with rose-colored glasses. While the UC is itself flawed, our current form of student government is clearly the lesser poison. Aldo M.

wildcat_arizona_2022_40,"Characters from the movies listed in opinions reporter Kate Herreras-Zinman’s article, “The five best movies you didn’t see this year.” 2022 has been a very good year for movies. Maybe it’s got something to do with the pandemic: creators have started going out and making more movies, and we could be getting the movies that didn’t come out in the past two years. Maybe it’s got something to do with luck. Some years are just better than others. Whatever the reason, the amount of content being put out this year is insane, and while it would be impossible to see every good movie of 2022, I hope this article can help you find a great movie you might not have otherwise found. Read on for the five best movies you didn’t see this year! “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” In “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,” Nicholas Cage portrays a fictionalized version of himself hired to entertain at a rich man’s (Pedro Pascal party. When the government tasks Cage with getting intel on the compound, Cage is thrust into a new life of espionage. “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” was so wonderfully weird as a comedy. I think it went very underappreciated, not just at the box office, but as a film in itself. Many audiences were so focused on the premise and the concept that “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” was Cage’s mainstream comeback that they lost sight of an amazing comedy. So why didn’t you see it? I think it’s, unfortunately, because of Cage. I knew as many people who said they wouldn’t see the movie, because Cage was the star, as I did people who were dying to see it because of him. I think both camps missed out on a brilliantly funny movie by focusing on his presence instead of his performance. “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” essentially has the most basic moral a movie about an actor can have: Treating your family with respect is more important than being famous. This is such a basic theme that it’s hard to breathe new life into it, but “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” takes it and runs with it. Cage becomes the hilariously ridiculous extreme of a self-centered actor, and proves that weird, high-concept comedies we don’t get much of these days, can still be funny. “Pearl” A standalone prequel to Ti West’s “X,” “Pearl” is the story of a young psychopath coming of age towards the end of World War One. Pearl will stop at nothing to become famous and leave town to get away from her oppressive parents. “Pearl” is a very easy movie to recommend to anyone with the stomach for it. It’s an incredibly realistic movie, and that’s exactly why it’s so good. It’s not tied down to one genre, but lets itself revel in two; “Pearl” is simultaneously a subdued period drama character study — a technicolor throwback that demands you understand how the titular Pearl thinks even if that’s not a particularly pleasant headspace — and a more traditional slasher. Ultimately, Mia Goth’s performance is what makes the character so engrossing. The movie is the slowest burn into insanity, and other performers may have left the role feeling cheesy or flat. Yet Goth and her director, West, found something magical when they wrote this script. No matter what the movie ramps up to or how tied the film is to its late-30s aesthetic, every second of the movie is completely believable. “Pearl” is an outlier in this list, in that it’s still playing right now. You can only watch the rest of these at home, but, if “Pearl” sounds appealing to you, you can head to atheater right now and watch it. “Bodies, Bodies, Bodies” In “Bodies, Bodies, Bodies,” a group of old friends reunites for a party. The party then takes a dramatic turn during a mystery game when one of the friends is found murdered. I’d assume this movie would have been a huge hit. Maybe I was making a leap there, but I’d think a Pete Davidson vehicle with a Charli XCX theme song would have a large audience. Of course, “Bodies, Bodies, Bodies” did well enough at the box office, and it was by no means a flop. However, it seems to me that very few people have actually seen it. If I ever bring it up to people, they tend to respond that they’ve been meaning to watch it and just haven’t gotten around to it yet. That’s a shame. The marketing of “Bodies, Bodies, Bodies” certainly makes it look like a slasher, and I can’t necessarily blame the marketing team for wanting to piggyback off of a more profitable genre, but it’s also pretty far from what “Bodies, Bodies, Bodies” actually is. “Bodies, Bodies, Bodies” positions itself as a modern-day Agatha Christie story. The characters at play fulfill all of the mystery archetypes audiences know, but with a distinctly modern sensibility. Moreover, a very specific source of terror comes from when someone is accused, but the audience knows they’re innocent. It feels something like when your friend is accused in “Among Us” or “Mafia.” Finally, it’s also a comedy and a very funny one at that. The idea that funny disasters will happen if 20-somethings get high together is an age-old one, but this movie proves that jokes of that kind still have a place. RELATED:OPINION: TV and film are using wokeness as a selling point “Mad God” The guy who did the dinosaurs from “Jurassic Park” made his own feature-length movie. I suppose that’s really all I need to say, but “Mad God” is so much more than just the creative image of one dinosaur guy. Post-apocalyptic movies are very common these days in so many forms, so it’s refreshing to have one be so wholeheartedly original. However, the word “original” doesn’t quite feel as though it does “Mad God” justice. I’d never seen anything even remotely resembling “Mad God” before I watched it, and I haven’t since either. Phil Tippett (the aforementioned dinosaur maker blends these post-apocalyptic tropes with images from “The Divine Comedy” and his own modern visions of hell; he makes it clear that this hell on earth is one of our own making by repeatedly showing us characters who are trying to escape it, whilst never quite clarifying whether or not we as the audience can. Tippett does this almost entirely without dialogue, instead using intense music and images. “Mad God” isn’t a religious movie. It’s a movie fueled by religious concepts, but you won’t find any recommendations for or against Christianity here. Instead, “Mad God” shows the futility of human conflict on a multi-millennial scale. What that means is up to you. “Watcher” “Watcher” features a young woman named Julia moving to Romania with her fiancé. After settling in, Julia has difficulty making new friends in the area or getting work, so she spends the bulk of her days at home, where she’s certain she sees a man watching her from the window across the street. All of this anxiety occurs when a serial killer is murdering women her age in her city. I had almost no expectations going into “Watcher.” A friend of mine and I wanted to see something with no parameters as long as it was good. “Watcher” worked with our schedules and had positive enough reviews. I came in knowing nothing about this movie and came out filled with adoration. Despite a traditional wide release, it seems to me that “Watcher” flew under the radar, and that saddens me. “Watcher,” at first glance is a horror movie, but it’s really something more cunning: a deconstruction of the slasher genre as a whole. Very few people die in “Watcher,” and we spend the entire movie in the headspace of the protagonist, Julia. Julia is a traditional slasher movie’s“final girl,”but most of the traditional death associated with slasher movies occurs offscreen as Julia fears it may be coming. There’s no mystery to solve or even a killer to run away from. There’s just Julia trying to get by despite a serial killer targeting women her age in her neighborhood. The movie creates a strange headspace to be in. “Watcher” shatters expectations by having the audience feel every emotion Julia feels by showing each and every one of them, centering on her in every scene. It’s a movie without side characters that seek only to emphasize its protagonist. You feel her anger and her frustration, but also her love, apathy and boredom. Despite living with her serial killer suspicions, Julia is still a person and the movie never lets you forget that. I’ve told lots of people to give “Watcher” a shot, and I’ll continue to do so. Overall Thoughts These are the five best movies you didn’t see this year, but 2022 is still far from over in cinema terms. Award season is around the corner with prestige picture releases coming out just before. It’s been a great year for movies, and I don’t see that stopping, but these five movies are a great place to start if you’re looking for films to see.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_26,"Truckers in Canada have beenprotesting against the country’s COVID-19 restrictionssince late January. They stopped traffic in the capital city of Ottawa as a part of their demonstrations, slowing down supply chains and closing nearly all businesses and daily activities. The self-proclaimed Freedom Convoy have also halted key border crossings, furthering the issues caused to the needed unification of the country during a confusing political time. As many are struggling to support each other during the still-looming pandemic, groups of extremists are consciously choosing to negatively impact public health and the international economy by taking a stance against proven science. Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau chose to invoke the National Emergencies Act to curb the protests. Hestatedthat “It is high time that these illegal and dangerous activities stop,” indicating that the anti-vaccination stance of the truckers was against the government’s rules. Since the “Freedom Convoy” is mainly representative of the nation’s far right, they have adopted a stance that has been widelyacceptedby the American right as well. The Canadian government’s choice to respond with the Emergencies Act and use of police force has received a lot of backlash, since it was seen as a disproportionately hostile way to deal with the truckers’ disconcerted opinion. Even though the protestors usually support a far- right party that does not currently hold any seats in the Canadian parliament, their organization has presented extreme demands that they hope to obtain through their protests. These demands include the lifting of all pandemic restrictions and the dissolution of the current parliament, including the removal of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from office. While Trudeau has repeatedly justified his invocation of the act, many still view it as an infringement of the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. But does this right still apply when an international economy and public health is at stake – especially when no real alternative to the pandemic is applicable? A small fringe group of extremists have managed toslowdown supply chains and force certain automakers to cancel shifts because of the reduced supply flow. Even as the vaccine mandate is accepted by a majority of Canadians, it is clear that not everybody has the desire to follow the rules set in place by the authorities to promote public health and reinvigorate the previously declining economy. Such remonstration only pushes the country backwards after all of the progress that has been made towards settling into a ‘new normal.’ Along with the national emergency order, the Canadian government alsoindicatedthat the demonstrators’ personal bank accounts can be frozen, along with the accounts of any other citizens that may have financially contributed to the cause. The police, who haveincreased protestor arrests, struggle to balance allowing protesters to voice their opinions to the authorities and arresting them based on mischief and conspiracy charges. As such, several forces were afraid to move forward with moving against the protestors, especially since multiple of them were armed extremists and veterans. Nearly 44% of the Freedom Convoy’s funding comes from right-wing American donors. The left wing has indicated that the right’s use of extreme methods has put them at a disadvantage instead of garnering support for their cause. This raises the question: should protests like these be terminated when they begin in order to reduce their potential future impact? The protesters had been dismissed as a small group in late January, and now it has entirely disrupted international supply chains, with the knowledge that the government has not and will not have any intentions to change the pandemic restrictions. As such, were the retaliatory actions taken by the Canadian authorities too extreme? Disruption is not necessarily a bad thing to use against protest efforts that have more bad impacts than good ones. For the right-wing truckers’ cause to have real effect in the pragmatic sense, they would have to use lobbying and negotiation with the corporations that enforce the government mandates. Shutting down roads and cities only hurts their own business potential and the entirety of the economy that depends on them. The fact that the police were fearful of utilizing force against the protestors indicates that the authorities’ response wasn’t wrong, but the protestors’ methods were.

state_press_2022_59,"The students at ASU live in a bubble while the rest of the world deals with a total collapse of all civil liberty. Cheers, to the end of days! I say to friends, sitting in a $71 million state-of-the-art production studio at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. I brandish my reasonably new iPhone 13, its screen open to a New York Timesarticleabout the dystopian reality of doctors smuggling abortion pills into red states. The Handmaid s Tale is becoming way too close to real life! we riff, comforted by the idea that nothing like that would ever happen in our reallife. My middle-class, ethnically diverse, queer, liberal and neurodivergent friends all laugh at this remark, because we re so clever for pointing out the daily list of atrocities committed against each other. As students at ASU, it s our responsibility to be educated about the world around us — and regurgitate those ideas into circles of people who agree with us. I mean, if I and my like-minded group of friends don t talk about what s really wrong with America, how will anything change? The students at ASU live in a bubble. A culturally diverse, inclusive and academically challenging bubble, but a bubble nonetheless. While the rest of the world deals with a total collapse of all civil liberty, we get to throwsticker-decorating partiesin the courtyard. Sure, at my brother s middle school, any kid hoping to join an LGBTQ+ support club has to be outed to their parents, but every counselor asks me my pronouns here. Perhaps it s time we look around and acknowledge we basically live in a Sun Devil-themed utopia, and face the harsh reality that it s merely an idealized simulation of real life. I m not the first to tell you this, but headlines are getting worse each day. Shootings, abortion bans, the war in Ukraine – it s a stressful time to be a young person in America. Each morning, I step outside my $100 million dormand feel the weight of every injustice globally. Sometimes, I just want to order my pumpkin cream cold brew without getting an alert on my phone that I have to stare at with a troubled expression, as the camera pans to reveal another human rights violation. Oh, the dramatic irony! I ve come to the troubling realization that the life we currently live is eerily close to the flashback part of adystopianmovie. Every time I open my mouth to speak, faint ominous music begins to play from seemingly nowhere. You try to vent to friends about it and the next thing you know, the entire lounge has had its warmth turned down in post-production. We re sitting on a campus underneath a comically large Simpsons-esque dome, where women are still human beings, fascists don t get elected and peace on earth has finally been accomplished. But on the outside – apodcastjust outperformed the Baltimore justice department. Outside these glass walls, students cry in protest as aknown white supremacistspeaks at a college campus. Or, was that inside the bubble? Oh boy. Pronoun-asking professors be damned, even our bubble of sanity has Jared Taylor. I guess next time I have something really pertinent to say, I ll just head to my nearest echo chamber and scream for a few hours.

crimson_2022_29,"On a Saturday in January 1835, a group of African Muslims, most slaves, began an uprising in Salvador, a city in the Brazillian state of Bahia. It was called the Males uprising, likely after a Brazilian word borrowed from the term “imale,” which means “Muslim” in Yoruba. Partly out of fear that revolutionary sentiment would ferment further, the Bahians violently punished the rebels and suppressed the activities of the Males. LikeHarvard, Brazil has a legacy of slavery that reaches back centuries. It was a main port of the slave trade, receiving almost half the slaves forcibly extracted from Africa and sent to the New World. And it was the last place in the Americas to formally abolish slavery, with many Afro-Brazilians still feeling the effects of this bloody history today. Now, due to skull records, we know that the supposed remains of at least one of the Male rebels ended up in the hands of Harvard. This discovery comes in the aftermath of a report thatfound that Harvard holds the remainsof 19 individuals who were enslaved and thousands of Indigenous and Native American remains. While the histories of each are long and winding, we know that the skull of the Male revolutionary ended up at Harvard through Gideon T. Snow, a U.S. citizen who lived in Brazil for some time. Snow sent the skull to Boston, where it was donated to the Boston Society for Medical Improvement. Eventually, the skull made its way into the hands of the Warren Anatomical Museum, a part of the Harvard Medical School. Now the Islamic community of Salvador in Bahia is calling for the repatriation of the enslaved man’s remains. According to reporting by The Crimson, in September of this year,Harvard saidthat they would return the remains of the 19 enslaved people, but as of yet, no further steps seem to have been taken. Advocates for the Islamic community in Salvador say that repatriation would begin to address Harvard’s violent legacy of scientific racism. Museums are not neutral spaces. They can maintain and exhibit histories of oppression. In particular, this case highlights the global reach of anti-Blackness. The transatlantic slave trade wasn’t an isolated, unidirectional event, but one that spanned geographies to the point that the skull of a leader of a Brazilian slave revolt could end up in the hands of America’s premier university. In recent years, calls for the decolonization of museums and therepatriationof their artifacts have increased. I struggle to believe that an institution could come to accumulate human remains, especially in such a quantity as Harvard has, through ethical means. As such, and to heal the communities from which they were taken, returning them should be a first priority. Even in death, through the inaction of museums, these individuals remain captive, denied a proper burial. Bodies of people enslaved and exploited during life should not suffer experimentation or exhibition in death. Harvard has released a report about their Legacy of Slavery. Now it is time to act. Returning the skull so that the Islamic community of Salvador can, at long last, provide it a proper funeral will represent a small but essential first step in the repatriation revolution needed to atone for Harvard’s harms.

wildcat_arizona_2022_17,"An illustration of Opinions writer Kelly Marry reading books that inspired the series “BookTok made me read it” by Emilie Marie Cuevas. BookTok has expanded many authors’ audiences, especially Colleen Hoover. During the pandemic, Hoover’s book “It Ends with Us” blew up on BookTok despite being released in 2016. The book’s popularity inspired her to write a sequel called “It Starts with Us” in October. As an avid reader, I found myself drawn to Hoover’s books because of suggestions on BookTok. After reading six of her books, I don’t think their problematic characters and plot should be celebrated. Hoover’s primary audience is teenage girls looking for their first romance novels, but her depictions of love are often abusive. Still, her characters stay together because their problems are “fixable,” like a couple stays together even though the male character burns down the female’s house, causing her to be disfigured, or the male character cheats on his wife for the female character while the wife is bedridden. There is no doubt that Hoover brought reading back to a younger audience, but her books should not be read by them or anyone else because of the problematic characters and the messages the books send her audience. “It Ends with Us” follows the story of Lily and Ryle and their romance. They meet on top of an apartment building, and Ryle takes a photo of Lily and blows it up to put it on the wall in his apartment, which is beyond creepy. Anytime Lily does anything Ryle doesn’t like, like laughing, he has an outburst directed toward her, yet she stays with him and makes excuses for him. Even when he pushes her down the stairs, she makes excuses. Her making excuses for him is horrible and sets a bad example for readers, especially her young audience. Most of her younger audience is entering their first relationship, and after reading her books, they might think all relationships are toxic, and their partners are hiding secrets from them. Since Hoover’s audience is young women, and she writes about toxic relationships, the young women tend to romanticize the toxicity of the relationships and think real love has to be unhealthy for them to stay together. This should not be the case, and Hoover sets a bad example for how women and men should be treated in relationships. Yes, these books are works of fiction. However, repeatedly seeing horrible relationships can influence how young minds think. Media significantly affects young people’s lives, and Hoover sets unrealistic expectations of relationships. RELATED:OPINION: Ticketmaster and Taylor Swift failed fans Hoover’s writing is also full of poorly written clichés, like overusing “just keep swimming” from the movie “Finding Nemo.” Her characters don’t have much depth. Her books follow the same character pattern: the girl meets a guy and falls in love, the guy is a big liar and they end up together with all loose ends tied up. When her characters go through trauma, it is discussed for a chapter then it’s never discussed in depth again. In “It Ends with Us,” Ryle’s sister knows of the abuse but still engages with him, even after Lily comes to her and asks her to keep her distance. Hoover uses trauma to expand the story, but she doesn’t substantially address it. Hoover’s books are popular, but people should look deeper into her writing to find it controversial because of how she writes about abuse and trauma. She should not be using these subjects as punch lines and instead writing about trauma to educate people on the realities of abuse. Many authors do a better job writing about trauma and don’t only have abuse in their books to advance the plot.

ubyssey_2022_31,"April 5, 2022 Written byIman Janmohamed Dear Iman, I realized that I don’t want to live with my roommates next year. I want to experience living alone before I graduate but I don t want to hurt their feelings. What should I do? Roommates make the world go ‘round. Whether that’s in your first-year dorm in Vanier or in a house off 16th avenue with seven of your closest friends in your second year, having roommates is something that almost everyone has to deal with at least once. Having roommates isn’t all that bad, and it seems as though you like your roommates. But no matter how much you like them, living alone — whether that be on or off-campus — is a nice stepping stone to ‘adult-ing’ (I’m not a millennial, I promise . As much as you may want to spare your roommates feelings, you do have to tell them eventually, and before the time to renew the lease comes. If you leave, they might want to find new roommates or even move to a different apartment, but they can’t do that if you don’t tell them you re leaving well in advance. It’ll also put your mind at ease, because you won’t have to hide your apartment hunting by getting your Zumper emails sent to a burner email. It’s easy to shoot them a text and turn off your phone, praying you won’t see your roommates in the kitchen. But is it worth it? No! Being straight-up and honest, though it may suck, will ensure your roommates feel okay when you decide to move out. They’ll be prepared so they aren’t scrambling to find someone to take your place super last minute. Sure, youmightbe able to save face and sneakily move out, but if you want to keep your relationships with your roommates and not be a complete asshole, you should tell them you’re leaving. Moving away from something that you’re used to, like having roommates, will be difficult, but by preparing and communicating with your roomies, you’ll maintain that support system long after you move out.

ubyssey_2022_46,"Dec. 2, 2022 Written byLauren Kasowski The Student Recreation Centre (SRC North construction near the Life Building will bring three new gymnasiums, an indoor running track and more campus fitness space according to banners promoting the building samenities. The SRC North was added to the campus plan after a2017 GamePlan public surveyidentified a lack of fitness spaces, gymnasium spaces and academic support for the School of Kinesiology. The project, which addresses these concerns, earned approval from the Board of Governors inJune 2022, and construction starteda few months later. In commercial buildings, the largest contributor to carbon pollution isspace heating and cooling. When looking at the SRC North, John Madden, the director of engineering and sustainability at Campus and Community Planning, said the building will use air source heat pumps, heat recovery ventilators, passive cooling and be “supplied energy through low carbon electrification” from the Bioenergy Research and Demonstration Facility (BRDF . The BRDF is located between the Marine Drive and Totem Park residences and provides about 30 per cent of campus’s heating needs through urban waste wood. Madden defined urban waste wood as any wood material that would otherwise decompose in a landfill like construction wood cuttings and grocery pallets. These are “made into the biomass that becomes the feedstock for the thermal energy that supports our our campus,” he noted. The design team, according to Madden, accounted for the carbon emissions that would occur before and during the SRC North construction. While the building’s materials aren’t necessarily low-carbon or recycled, the team was influenced by embodied carbon guidelines. Embodied carbonis all of the carbon emissions produced making a material for a building. This includes the fuel required to harvest the material, the energy needed to process and transport it, as well as any packaging. The scope of embodied carbon can be expanded to include the energy outputs of construction and disassembly, if desired. These guidelines helped the design team “in terms of how they think about the deployment of steel, glass and concrete to minimize the amount of embodied carbon associated with the material aspects of the building,” said Madden. Looking at embodied carbon gives a more comprehensive analysis of the building’s emissions. UBC’s guidelines look at embodied carbon from the material’s harvest up to and including the construction emissions. Considering theconstruction industry emits about the same amount of carbon as one million cars in a year, including the installation of materials is crucial in embodied carbon calculations. “If we re going to solve climate change, we have to address the full extent of impacts associated with buildings that are being constructed on our campus,” Madden said. To further ensure the full consideration of impacts, the building will be LEED Gold Certified, and its location is intended to aid in reducing transportation emissions, according to Madden. Sustainable design was in thetop-three most talked about topicsduring the SRC North’s public consultation period, which happened in February of 2020. Students, faculty, staff, and community members had two weeks to fill out an online survey or attend a public brief open house to voice their support or concern for the project.

wildcat_arizona_2022_60,"A woman in the crowd raises a fist in solidarity with Betsy Boggia, who speaks at the rally for legal abortion on May 14, 2022, in Armory Park in Tucson, Arizona. Protests like these will likely become much more common following Friday’s Roe v. Wade overruling. Today, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that in 1973 allowed women of this country the right to an abortion. Now, as the nation is at war with reproductive health, we are left wondering: “what does this mean for me?” If you are young, old, middle-aged, partnered or single, this ruling applies to you. It affects everyone who lives in America and believes in freedom: freedom of choice, freedom to make decisions about one’s own body. This ruling is a step backward in the fight for a truly free democracy. But it is not over yet. There are still options for people who need, or want, to get an abortion. Here’s what is available to you: If you are living in Tucson, I have good news for you: Mayor Regina Romero has publicly stated that she is in support of a woman’s right to choose. Ina Tweet posted this morning, Romero said, “Though not unexpected, this infringement of our rights is hard to accept. The Supreme Court has delivered a wrecking ball, dismantling the rights of SOME people in this country.#IDissent.” And Romero is not just talking—she’s taken action to protect the rights of women’s choice over their own bodies. In aunanimous rulingalong with Tucson’s city council made in early June, Romero passed a resolution to uphold abortion rights for women, as well as to protect physicians performing abortions. This contradicts Arizona’s law SB1164 which dictates that physicians performing abortions would face charges of a Class 6 Felony. This means that the Tucson Police Department willnot arrest physicians performing abortionsor take action to arrest those seeking abortions themselves. RELATED:Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade This is a point of hope for those who seek out and perform abortions. However, Gov. Doug Duceysaid in a statement to KGUN9that the city of Tucson does not have the right to make such statements, and he will rescind state funding to the city should they continue down this path. The consequences of this for Tucson residents are unclear. As of now, Arizona residents may still get an abortion.According to Politico, access to abortion in the state is still permissible until the fetus reaches viability. For those who are unaware, viability refers tothe state of the fetus’ developmentwhere it is capable of living. But this will not remain forever.The ban on abortionswill go into effect no later than Sept. 29. There is quite a bit that you can do to fight for pro-choice policies during this tumultuous time. The Arizona Primary Election is coming up on Aug. 2. You can find a list of candidates and what they stand for on the12 News website. In preparation for the Nov. 8 election for the Senate and House of Representatives, Arizonans for Reproductive Freedom is floating a petition that, if signed by 350,000 Arizona registered voters, will have a chance of making it on the ballot.According to KGUN9, the petition aims to make women’s reproductive rights part of Arizona’s Constitution. In order for the petition to have a chance of making it on the ballot, petitioners must sign by July 7. Check out Arizonans for Reproductive Freedom’swebsitefor information on how and where to sign. If you are currently seeking an abortion in the Tucson area, theTucson Abortion Support Collectivehas plenty of information for those seeking help or care.Planned Parenthood Tucsonalso has many different options and opportunities for care and help for those in need. The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade will change the landscape of this nation for years to come, but the fight for freedom in women’s reproductive healthcare is not over. You can still make a difference and help protect the rights of women everywhere to choose what happens to their own bodies.

stanforddaily_2022_75,"As Stanford students, we often call ourselves “ducks,” trying to stay afloat. On the surface we look calm, but we are all, to varying degrees, furiously paddling beneath the surface. We balance commitments, academics, extracurriculars and personal challenges, while attempting to convince those around us that we are thriving. This is our shared experience — and yet we do not talk enough about the struggles that make the paddling so taxing. As a result, we often feel alone in our challenges, when the reality is that many, if not all, of us are navigating personal struggles. We push ourselves to succeed and compete, and we often define achievement in the context of independence and drive — in the context of everything looking “fine.” But it’s become clear that things need to change. It’s time to reframe the conversation about mental health at Stanford. At The Daily, we believe that we are well-positioned to start a dialogue. We want to amplify the voices of our community members and their experiences with mental health, while highlighting the resources that are available and investigating the issues at the heart of these challenges. That is why we’ve created this special issue focused entirely on mental health and wellness at Stanford. We hope that you’ll gain a broader understanding of wellness on campus and a desire to start the mental-health conversation within your own communities. Beyond this special issue, we want to ensure that our coverage continues to highlight and destigmatize mental health at Stanford. By talking about our experiences and supporting and listening to one another, can we promote meaningful change and cultivate a healthier campus community. This is just the beginning.

stanforddaily_2022_105,"While I still can’t fully grasp the inequalities I will face in my career in STEM, I’ve acknowledged the mindset and identity I will have to craft in the face of the barriers to come. Instead of being able to read about these events in my history books, I am still part of generations of working women striving for workplace equality. Though I can take my voting rights or my higher education for granted thanks to (the decades of protest resulting in the ratification of the 19th Amendment and women’s college educationfinally opening up in the 19th century, my working age will be dominated by the movements and struggles to create an equal world for women in STEM. Yet, despite the discrimination and lesser prospects I anticipate during my lifetime, I’m hopeful for better futures for women in later generations entering the STEM field. Progress toward decreasing the gender gap hasstagnatedover the past few decades. But it’s hard to understand why this stagnation remains — particularly when statistics, surveys and studies continue to show that gender diversityincreases innovation,pushes economic growthand leads to amore inclusive societyoverall. Since beginning this mini-series on the gender disparity in STEM, I received an email from Nita Singh Kaushal ’03, founder and CEO ofMiss CEOand lecturer at Stanford School of Engineering. When she read earlier articles from the series, she told me that the experiences I described made her feel like “she was reading her own personal journey as an electrical engineering grad navigating the tech industry” and that the content would be “not out of place if the articles had been published in the 1960s.” Women earn only83%of equivalent male full-time workers’ salaries — meaning that women need to work an extra 44 days to achieve the same yearly salary as men. But closing the gender gap doesn’t benefit women only. Increasing the number of women employed in STEM fields could accelerate U.S. GDP growth by boosting women’s cumulative earnings by$299 billionand adding roughly$5.87 trillionto the global stock market within 10 years. This economic growth, however, isn’t due to increased labor force participation alone. Women tend to invest alarger proportionof their household income toward their children’s education than men; they’re also14% more likelyto participate in job-related savings plans. Reducing the gender gap in STEM also leads to more innovation.Studieshave suggested that diversity drives innovation, as diverse teams include different voices, viewpoints, expertise and life experiences and can therefore be more effective at problem-solving. Astudyby the Boston Consulting Group showed that companies with above-average diversity yielded higher earnings and that the presence of fair employment practices, participative leadership and open communications can generate up to 19 percentage points more in innovation revenue compared to companies which reported below-average diversity in their leadership. Poor representation within companies leads to gender-biased designs, products and services. Somecasesexamined by the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development (UN CSTD included seat belts whichdidn’t factorin the smaller size of women and medicationsbeing tested on men only. Even the female personas of smart assistants like Alexa and Siri have led to “children barking commands at them without common courtesy, potentially shifting behavior towards real women,” as noted in a similar UN CSTDreport. Women’s freedoms within are limited by this gender disparity, but some organizations are beginning to make changes. A previous job posting by Nordstrom included the followingnote: Some other examples include Google’s “Tech Bytes” series, which highlights Black women engineers, and “Women Techmakers,” a program which brings together over70,000women each year. Airbnb alsoreported27.5% women in tech internally in 2019. Progress has also been made globally. In the European Union — where41% of scientists and engineers are women— women outnumber men in these professions in Lithuania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Portugal and Denmark. STEM researchers are majority female in many South American countries, including the Argentina, Bolivia, Trinidad and Tobago, Panama and Venezuela. In Asian countries like Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kuwait, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Thailand,women make up the majority of their researchers. For these nations, active encouragement for female participation in science, opportunities for employment in government-funded facilities andfocused welfare and social policiesare amongsome of the factorswhich have increased their numbers of women in the workplace. Despite womenmaking up only 29%of the national STEM workforce, and despitewomen making up 3% of STEM industry CEOs, I’m still hopeful we can achieve equality for women in STEM. A future designed equally by women ultimately results inradical changesin how we build products, create services, communicate, produce food, provide health care, work and educate the world for future generations. As the current working generation, we can be active in the different roles we all hold and continue to show up for younger girls through representation, policy-making, outreach and hiring. By facing the STEM gender disparity head on, we can really create a gender-equal future in STEM, ultimately giving women the freedoms, comfort and access to society that many of our male counterparts already enjoy.

wildcat_arizona_2022_37,"An eastbound Sun Link tram is stopped at the Main Gate Square station on University Boulevard on Friday, July 20, 2018. Walking is not just a means of transportation, it is a way of life. Walkability is core to a city’s identity, and this holds true for Tucson despite being smaller than some of the more iconic walkable cities like New York City or Tokyo. A large portion of Tucson’s walkability and ease of transportation comes from convenient access to theSun Link, which may be subject to a change in January when fare-free riding is set to expire. Walkability is anamorphous conceptthat can generally be understood to refer to how a space is designed with pedestrians in mind to facilitate foot traffic. In the United States, walkability can be hard to find as most cities are designedmore for the carthan the person. In much of the greater Tucson area, you’d be hard-pressed to find a single square mile that would be considered walkable. Walk Score, a popular online tool that rates neighborhoods and assigns a walkability score based on multiple factors, rates Tucson as the27th most walkable cityin the U.S. Walk Score assigns points based on the accessibility of the city to pedestrians. Points were reduced based on the relatively few restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance for the average Tucsonan. Additionally, points were reduced for the limited public transportation options for those on foot. Put simply, in Tucson, like in much of the United States, you need a car to get around. The reliance on personal vehicles to move through Tucson is so apparent that it has even served as a somber inspiration for resident artists likeNazafarin Lotfi. However, closer to the university there’s an oasis of walkability. In the area surrounding campus, there are bridges underneath Speedway Boulevard, which allow foot traffic to avoid dangerous road crossings, and the aforementioned Sun Link, which allows passengers to go further distances in a free and shaded tram. These features open up access to a much wider area than many pedestrians take advantage of, and I’d like to see that change. After moving to Tucson, I quickly began taking walks from my home in the direction of campus to familiarize myself with the area. I first noticed what a rarity sidewalks seem to be as I often found myself forced to choose between walking on someone’s lawn or sharing the street with cars and cyclists. When I reached Speedway Boulevard, I was happy to see that some attention to safety had been paid, as there was a means of crossing underneath, saving me a route that has been fartoo dangerousat times. Once on campus, the emphasis on walkability was apparent. Numerous paths carve the campus away from speeding cyclists and distracted drivers, lined with trees and benches for shade and beauty. There are several stops for the Sun Link as well as you get closer to the heart of campus, perfect for anyone looking to go from campus out west or vice versa. As a student, being able to walk to class and not worry about paying for parking or a Sun Link ticket is life-changing. I’m more incentivized to explore the area when I can do so freely and easily with the power of my two legs. In addition to the practicality of walking, there are numerous health benefits. Walking is an aerobic activity that can count towardsthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendationof 150 minutes of moderate activity per week. The specificbenefitsassociated with walking are many and include weight loss, increased energy levels and strengthening your immune system. Walking is a convenient exercise for most people to do, given its minimal required gear and low impact on the body. For people on a fitness journey, walking is an easy exercise to track, as most smart devices have built-in pedometers that will track your distance so you can set informed goals. Walking is not only a great way of maintaining a healthy body but walking has been shown to benefit mental health in a myriad of ways.Studiesinto a city’s walkability showed that people who lived in more walkable areas had higher socialization, meaning people who lived in an area that was more accessible by foot were more likely to trust others and be socially and politically engaged. Walking improvessleeptoo, which is correlated with having a better mood.Studieshave also shown evidence that even brief 10-minute walks are linked to improvement in depressive symptoms. Walking, like drinking water, is one of those rare phenomena that are easy to do and confer a multitude of health benefits. While walking generally doesn’t require skill to do, there are still several considerations that should be made before lacing up and going out. The most important consideration when going for a walk is safety. If you are going to walk around campus, it would be wise tosign upfor UAlert so that you can get notified immediately if it ever becomes unsafe to be out and about. Additionally, it is always smart to have other people with you and to be aware of thelocationof the nearestblue light emergency phone, especially at night. If you’re walking at night and feel uncomfortable, don’t forget you have access to a free pick-up service through SafeRide by calling 520-621-SAFE (7233 . I want to reinforce that I have walked around campus many times without concern, but it is always prudent to be considerate of your resources when doing so. RELATED:UA students speak out for free transit at Tucson City Council meeting As mentioned, a large part of the walking experience on campus involves using the Sun Link to save time and steps. I’ve had several long study days in which I make my way from Scented Leaf Tea House to Time Market, before ending the evening out on Fourth Avenue, all conveniently along the same free streetcar line. As it stands, the Sun Link willhalt free fareafter the end of this year. I can’t imagine life without it, and I have no memory of life before it, so I’ve reached out to someone who can remember a time with fares but is working to keep that time in the past. To better understand campus walkability and the challenge it faces, I spoke to Associated Students of the University of Arizona President and lifelong Tusconan Patrick Robles. In an interview conducted via phone call, I asked him about the impact of the decision to make the Sun Link free in March 2020. Robles said, “Free transit has been an economically helpful, safe mode of transit and environmentally friendly.” Robles emphasized the financial implications for cash-strapped students, going on to say, “It’s no secret that we live in a time of great economic peril, tuition continues to go up and so does the cost of living. We have to do whatever we can do to make people’s lives easier and more livable. That’s less money people have to spend on gas, that’s more money going to students and what they need.” Robles acknowledged that there are financial implications for the Sun Link as well since they would be losing fares, thus setting the scene for the current fight that he and many other students find themselves in. Dozens of students, Robles included, attended atown hallmeeting on Aug. 24 to voice their concerns. Ever since, Robles has been active with other students, continuing to advocate for free fare for students by attending council meetings and meetings with prominent figures including the Mayor of Tucson and UA President Dr. Robert C. Robbins. When asked about the current status of their work, Robles mentioned that in recent meetings, “Student leaders were name-dropped by council members and the mayor as a result of conversations between UA students and parking and transportation services.” Although campus walkability will likely not be completely decimated by a decision to reinstate fares, the Sun Link remains crucial to students’ ability to walk and explore their community. Free public transportation enables convenient and more diverse walks, which makes for happier and healthier students. As such, the fate of the Sun Link affects us all. In closing, I’d like to leave you with Robles’ advice to students who want to get involved, “Come visit us at the UA office on the 3rd floor of the Student Union, we’re actively working on a myriad of issues … I recommend folks email pts-parkingmarketing@arizona.edu to reach out to UA’s Parking and Transportation services department. The more students they hear from, the more pressure placed.” Follow theDaily WildcatonTwitter Ben Pope is a second-year medical student at the UA.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_2,"Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas faced backlash from thepublicfollowing thedisclosureof text message exchanges between his wife and conservative activist, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. Following the news that Joe Biden was the projected winner of the 2020 presidential election, text messages reveal that Ginni Thomas used her connections in support of the former presidential administration’s attempt of rescinding the election results by turning to the Supreme Court. Themessageswere revealed by the House Select Committee during the investigation on the Jan. 6 riot. “Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!” Ginni Thomas writes. “The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.” Meadow’s attorney George Terwilliger IIIexpressedthat “nothing about the text messages presents any legal issues.” However, it is critical to note the obvious issues at hand. 52%of the American public calls for Justice Thomas to recuse himself from theTrump v. Thompsoninsurrection case. The case consists of an investigation into the extent of Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 riot and the question of whether or not the former president could apply his right toExecutive Privilege. The Trump administration claimed that the former president held the right to refusing to turn over documents to the committee pertaining to the investigation on the grounds that he could apply his executive privilege. This claim has been brushed over by the Supreme Court as of recently with the implication that it is significantly weak. While the individual votes of each justice have not been shared, Justice Thomas was thelone dissenteron the matter. His position brings into concern the credibility of his decision. So, should the justice of the High Court recuse himself from the aforementioned case given the nature of the political controversy caused by his wife, whose behavior is akin to that of a “right-wing lobbyist?” For the sake of the delicacy of American democracy, he should. Unlike federal judges, Supreme Court justices are not under an obligation toabideby the samecode of conductimposed upon the judges of the lower courts. Lines blur in regards to guidelines like Canon 2, which states that a judge “should not allow family, social, political, financial, or other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment.” Because Supreme Court justices are able to treat their rulebook as a suggestion box, the public should take their decisions with a grain of salt. Justice Thomas has the ability to sway from one end of the political pendulum to the other if he sees fit. The ‘how’ in how he became the lone dissenter of the Jan. 6 riot case becomes more questionable if we ask ‘why.’ Why did Justice Clarence Thomas dissent from the majority in regards to this case? Why has he not yet recused himself? Although his failure to recuse himself does not necessarily mean he has committedjudicial misconduct, it is important to understand the threat that this controversy imposes to the very system of American democracy. The lack of a Supreme Court code of conduct implies the members of our highest court have the opportunity to, quite frankly, reign supreme. Justice Thomas maintaining his current position on the case showcases that our judicial system is corrupt and lenient to political ideology, disrupting thechecks and balanceson which the foundation of our constitution is built upon. No matter which way Justice Thomas votes, the text messages sent by his wife Ginni Thomas in favor of the lawsuit ultimately weakens his credibility on the matter altogether. The Justice of the Supreme Court’s failure to recuse himself comes from a place of pride rather than civic responsibility. The American people will not forget this moving forward.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_51,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs have helped fuel the rise of cryptocurrency’s prevalence over the past year. Celebrities such as Steph Curry, Jimmy Fallon, Eminem and many others have bought NFTs and displayed public support for them. The Twitter account of the late Stan Lee even postedan advertisement for an NFT collection, a decision that has faced outcry for being incredibly disrespectful to Lee’s legacy. This widespread celebrity marketing proves that the increased exposure of NFTs is the result of an expansive, unethical promotional campaign that overlooks the harmful effects of NFTs on the environment. An NFT can be any form of digital media, but the primary medium NFTs have been utilized in is the digital art market. The sales of NFTs come at a great cost, but there is some appeal to NFT ownership. The phrase “non-fungible” denotes that each NFT is wholly unique. Despite others’ capability to screenshot or download one’s purchased NFT, the exclusivity of being the true owner of a one-of-a-kind product remains a major selling point; there are evenevents for NFT holders, and high-profile NFTs typically sell at anywhere from five toseven figures. Even a low-grade NFT can sell for hundreds of dollars. Despite the presence of scammers, digital artists can make a profit through the sale and resale of their products. Besides that, the benefit of NFTs to society is minimal and far outweighed by the negatives. Beyond the space of digital art, some music artists have released projects as NFTs, although the practice has yet to enter into the mainstream world of music. There is a simple reason as to why: there is absolutely nothing stopping a consumer from recording the music themselves and leaking it to the public. Just as one could attempt to resell the artist’s music at a lower price, scammers can gain money byimpersonating digital artists, duplicating their artwork and even impersonating companies, as the founder of the cryptocurrency service Metakeytweeted. In regards to environmental impact, NFTs use high levels of electricity consumption and carbon production that are extremelydetrimental to the environment. They are purchased with the cryptocurrency Ethereum, which has exploded in popularity since the rise of NFTs. A single Ethereum transaction consumes the electrical energy that the average U.S. household does in about 8.2 days. Some NFT creators have donated money to causes that support the environment. Still, any contributions from the cryptocurrency community cannot come close to making up for the negative effect of their transactions. No price can be put on the health of Earth’s ecosystem. Countless big-name celebrities and influencers beyond the ones mentioned above have bought and promoted NFTs. Their presentation of the NFT market as a lucrative opportunity is dangerous to their followers, as it is not accessible to the average person by any means. Many are able to make a profit by reselling highly sought-after sneakers on sites likeStockX, but the price of NFTs is ridiculously inflated in comparison, which makes the resale field carry a great risk. The average person cannot responsibly spend thousands of dollars on an NFT in the hopes of a positive return on their investment. The vast majority of people have nothing to gain from this market, so its existence is frankly unnecessary. Nothing is going to stop affluent individuals from gathering these collectibles at the cost of Earth’s ozone layer, but it would be best for everybody if the usage of NFTs moved away from digital art and any other medium involving monetary transactions with Ethereum. In a testament to the artificial popularity of NFTs, Atlanta rapper Gunna bought a $300,000 NFT from the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club collection and tattooed it on his leg, yet the release of his latest album “DS4EVER” had no involvement with the NFT space. Gunna proved that NFTs in their current form are nothing more than a fad that rich individuals spend absurd amounts of money on simply for the thrill of it, but this fad will have permanent consequences. For Gunna, the consequence is having a silly ape visible on his leg, but for the world, it is the acceleration of global warming. Daniel Waters is an Opinion Intern for the 2022 winter quarter.

ubyssey_2022_11,"Sept. 12, 2022 Written byMartin Edwini-Bonsu Recorded lectures have become a mainstay in universities due to the COVID-19 pandemic and hybrid classrooms. However, with the return to full in-person classes, some professors may feel there is no need to record lectures anymore. However, the accessibility benefits of recording lectures outweigh the drawbacks for students and professors. Lecture recordings are beneficial for immunocompromised and disabled students who may feel uncomfortable attending live classes due to the ongoing risks of COVID-19, or who may be forced to miss class due to illness. Students should be encouraged to learn in a way that works for them, and they should not be penalized for being immunocompromised or sick. Besides the beneficiality of recorded lectures for students who cannot attend class, these recordings impact student relationships with education. Recorded lectures allow for better note-taking since students can revisit parts of the lectures. This allows for fewer repetitive questions for professors during office hours so more intricate questions can be resolved. While online lectures have the reputation of making class attendance lower,a study published byComputers & Educationsays that after online lectures became available, the average attendance across multiple classes dropped from 85.7 per cent to 81 per cent, which is statistically minimal for student absenteeism to be a major drawback for lecture recordings. Inmost other instances, online lectures increased or maintained existing levels of student attendance. However, students should think twice before skipping class with the intent to watch recorded lectures later. Recorded lectures should supplement, not replace, in-person instruction. Even if professors wanted to record their lectures, only70 per cent of GTS (general teaching spaces classroomswith 30 seats or more can record and stream lectures. There needs to be more classrooms with this ability so that students don’t fall behind and are able to revisit important parts of their lectures. Maximizing the benefits and minimizing the disadvantages of lecture recordings can lead to more support for disadvantaged students, better accessibility to online learning and better use of office hours so that students can ask more challenging questions. More than ever, this pandemic has proven that lecture recordings are not only a responsible public health safety measure in education but a great enhancement to student achievement.

stanforddaily_2022_22,"I’ve just read thereportof the Task Force on the History of Jewish Admissions at Stanford. As a successful undergraduate applicant from western Los Angeles in the mid-1960s, here’s what I remember. Like the people — such as Robin Kennedy and Mark Mancall — cited in the report, as a college-bound student at Culver City High School in the early 1960s, I learned of Stanford’s reputed “Jewish quota,” probably from my high-school counselor. I don’t recall any specific number. It was just that there appeared to be a smaller share of Jewish undergraduates at Stanford than at UC Berkeley, Stanford’s athletic rival. Stanford’s emphasis on non-academic admissions criteria, such as athletics and other student activities, coincidentally discriminated against Jewish students, who I thought were more academically focused. Stanford’s evaluation of “personal,” non-academic qualities is discussed starting page 26 of the Task Force report. But there seemed to be more. From my experience, Southern California’s Jewish community was largely assimilated. I knew of no young people who wore traditional Jewish garb or payess (sideburns . We shared the beaches and played sports with our primarily white gentile friends. We partied and dated non-Jewish kids. I did, however, give up my last year of Little League baseball to prepare for my Bar Mitzvah. In my senior high school year, I was already admitted to the University of California to take a calculus class at UCLA. With UC as a back-up, the only school I applied to was Stanford. By the 1960s, Stanford combined a strong liberal arts education with science and engineering, professional schools and a nationally visible athletic program. It was the place to go to establish personal relationships with others who could open doors for a lifetime of business, political or cultural success. My high school counselor made it clear what I had to do — beyond grades, test scores and advanced math programs — to get in. I earned three varsity letters as one of the weakest members of Culver’s tennis team, and joined clubs. I was active politically in the civil rights movement, but I don’t recall that I emphasized that in my application. Superficially, at least, I was the well-rounded applicant that Stanford was looking for. At least three of us from Culver were accepted into Stanford in the fall of 1966: Myself, a Jewish girl and our league’s top athlete in football and baseball — not Jewish. Why do I think that Stanford’s powers-that-be feared having too many Jews on campus, particularly Jews who easily mixed in with other white students? To some degree it was persistent prejudice, prejudice targeted against many minority groups (in those days, Jews were considered a minority . It wasn’t because Stanford administrators believed that Jews controlled and manipulated the world economy. They knew better, recruiting and admitting the sons and daughters of the American ruling class. I believe it was because they believed that Jewish radicals would threaten the status quo. Jews had long been among theleaders and foot-soldiersof left-wing movements throughout Europe and the United States. Many of the leaders and other activists in Berkeley’s 1964-65 Free Speech Movement, including my own sister, were Jewish. The people who ran Stanford did not want to see a repeat of the rebellion already happening at the larger university across the Bay. While I do believe that Stanford discriminated against Jews in admissions well into the 1960s, we activists came to believe that academic success in high school should not have been the only criterion for welcoming undergraduates to Stanford. Many bright and potentially successful Black and Brown students did not qualify for Stanford academically because they did not have the opportunities that white and some Asian students had, but if admitted and provided with support they too were Stanford material. So we fought along with Stanford’s few students of color, starting with demonstrations following the 1968 murder of Martin Luther King Jr., for Stanford to broaden its admissions criteria and target financial aid to those communities. Stanford’s fear that Jews would upend the status quo turned out to be dead-on. I observed, then and now, that Jews played a disproportionate role in the upheaval that characterized the late 60s and early 70s at Stanford. For example, the 1969 Public Broadcasting Laboratories documentary on Stanford SDS,Fathers and Sons,featured four undergraduate leaders, three of whom were Jewish — one of whom was me.

rice_thresher_2022_1,"ByThresher Editorial Board11/29/22 10:54pm Anyone who walked through the academic quad on Monday encountered the statue of William Marsh Rice visibly covered by sheets of A4 paper that read “习近平下台,” which roughly translates to “Resign Xi Jinping.” Other signs read “No emperor in a republic” and “Not my president.” These signs are part of larger protests happening in mainland China — that are being echoed by Chinese people across the world — in response to nearly three years of aggressive COVID lockdowns across the country. While these protests are monumental in both their scale and specificity, we’ve noticed that conversations about them and their impact on our international students have been largely non-existent. This is not the first time this semester that we’ve noticed this phenomenon. Beginning in mid-September, protests broke out across Iran after a young woman was beaten to death by the “morality police” for violating the Iranian government’s dress codes. The reaction on campus was mostly crickets. We are not trying to compare the situations in China and Iran; both are abhorrent in their own right. But whether it’s people holdingblank sheets of A4paper symbolic of the Chinese government’s censorship, orburning hijabsin Iran, people around the world are trying to send a message. And when they demand the attention of the world, it is imperative that we give it. It might not be entirely incumbent on our small university to take direct action, it’s on all of us to pay attention when they talk. We should be cognizant of the issues beyond the hedges that are actively affecting the many international students on this campus. So, when posters are being put up around campus, read them. When rallies are organized, like the onetodayin support of Iranian protests, consider attending. We understand that social issues here in the U.S. demand a lot of our attention. For example, we devoted four pages of this week’s special issue to coverage on the history of abortion at Rice. But it is also important to recognize that our international students, while dealing with domestic social issues, bear the additional burden of conflicts in their home countries. While we might not be able to mitigate that burden, we as a student body can make an active effort to support these movements. And at the very least, listen. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_47,"On the evening of Jan. 9, a modest version of the Golden Globes took place with very little fanfare at an undisclosed location in Beverly Hills — without a single television camera or red carpet in sight. On the surface, this appeared to be just another sacrifice of a beloved awards show in the name of social distancing and public health mandates. Yet, the new COVID-19 variant sweeping the nation was not the reason for this year’s absence of festivities. In fact, the scaled-back ceremony is actually part of a wider publicity stunt by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA to salvage its reputation in light of recent scandals. Widespreadbacklashfollowing the 2021 Golden Globes spawned anexposéby the Los Angeles Times which placed heavy scrutiny on the HFPA’s internal corruption and lack of diversity. Not only did the article purport that members were in the practice ofaccepting gifts and promotional materials from studios and publicists, laying bare a flagrant conflict of interest, it also revealed that the HFPA had zero Black journalists among its 87 members. This longstanding history of quid pro quo favors and gifts exchanged for flattery and awards underscores the interdependence between Hollywood’s elite and the press. Given the reciprocal relationship of these two groups, it comes as no surprise to anyone that the HFPA’s conduct over the years consists of many ethical lapses. Both entities have benefited immensely from this system, which is why we should question the sincerity in all of this outrage and the motivations behind their symbolic gestures of apology. That is assuming the everyday person on the street is even paying attention, let alone has any investment in all of this fuss. Meanwhile, NBC’s indefinite halt on their televised broadcast of the ceremony will allow space for “transformational change” to occur, thus perfectly setting up the Golden Globes for their redemption arc. TheHFPA’s planto atone for their past and to neatly resolve this PR nightmare includes a laundry list of reforms: an expansion of their board of directors and members to include more BIPOC voices, a five-year partnership with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP and greater oversight and restrictions on gift-receiving, to name a few. Though these ideas are all well and good, some normalcy might actually be what audiences are yearning for. A return to the basic values and principles that unite us all in the movie-watching experience is much needed. While representation is important, so is escapism. We often indulge in movies because they transport us away from our realities, which have become increasingly characterized bygrowing wealth inequality, racial divide and the constant culture war. And as the lives of ordinary people seem to be at the mercy of an uncontrollable virus, many of us see right through the veneer of these ceremonies. The entertainment industry is so obsessed with virtue-signaling and being on the right side of history that it has left its audience in the dust. Nevertheless, the Golden Globes will inevitably make their comeback in 2023, seeing that they make good on their promises for more inclusivity. Perhaps industry insiders and devoted cinephiles may still want to see what goes on at the Globes and who takes home a golden statuette, though it’s safe to say that the majority of Americans couldn’t be less interested. A word of advice to Hollywood and the HFPA — or whoever is listening: No one at home wants to sit through another acceptance speech bemoaning fossil fuels and the dire need to save our planet from a person who likely flew in for the awards by way of a private jet.

wildcat_arizona_2022_21,"At an Arizona women’s basketball game, the University of Arizona dedicated the halftime show to the Indigenous people who used to live on this land by having a Native American dance on the court on Nov. 18 in McKale Center. Arizona’s Secretary of State Katie Hobbs was recentlyelectedto be the next governor of Arizona, defeating Republican opponent Kari Lake. As she takes on this new position and responsibility, there are many hot topics she is focusing on in Arizona, such as abortion, immigration and voting rights. Hobbs also has excellent and lengthy plans for collaborating with tribal communities in Arizona. Ensuring that these ideas are implemented is the biggest step for the next Governor if she wants to ensure tribal communities have a larger voice in the state’s political processes. Indigenous communities have historically been excluded and overlooked in elections. Despite the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, those living onreservationscontinued to be denied the right to vote. In fact, it wasn’t until 1948 thatArizonarecognized the right of Native Americans to vote. While this seems like progress that was made a long time ago, voter suppression is still targeting these communities. Many laws that make voting harder still take direct aim at Native Americans. There is a lack of investment in voting infrastructure on reservations, and many ballot drop boxes and election offices are locatedmilesfrom where reservations are. Politicians seem to also lack an awareness of how long these communities have lived in their own states. Lake herself eventweetedthat she was in the fight for governor to preserve Western heritage and the spirit of the cowboys, evidently voiding the history and heritage of the indigenous communities within Arizona. Governor-elect Hobbs has displayed an interest in uplifting Native Americans in Arizona and ensuring that her administration works collaboratively with these communities. Sheplansto increase engagement with tribal leaders regarding policymaking and hire a dedicated Tribal Policy Advisor to help solve problems that affect both tribal nations and the state as a whole. Hobbs also has lengthy plans toincreaseaccessibility to the right to vote and encourage those on reservations to participate in elections. Other plans include expanding educational opportunities, creating a fairer justice system and combating extreme weather and droughts. These diverse plans show her interest in expanding relationships with Native communities and differ from some of the current Governor’s policies. Governor Doug Ducey and Republicans in Arizona created voterrestrictionpolicies in early 2021 after the 2020 election. Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez claimed that theactionsand policies of Governor Ducey and other Republicans did not recognize the unique challenges Native Americans face when it comes to voting, such as the long drives to polls and unreliable mail systems. It is obvious that Hobbs is trying to do something different. RELATED:OPINION: President Biden’s marijuana pardon should signal states to make reform While her plans for these policies are great, ensuring they come to fruition under her administration is just as essential as creating the ideas. If she wants to build a collaborative Arizona, she will need to prioritize these goals and not forget these communities like others have. Furthermore, she will also need to hear and listen to Native Americans’ voices when discussing their needs and collaboration. Moreperspectivesexpand options and enhance the value of the final policy decisions. It is yet to be seen how these policy ideas will benefit indigenous communities and what relationship Hobbs will have with tribal leaders. She has an excellent opportunity to demonstrate how to effectively involve these overlooked communities in our current political processes, as well as create a more inclusive state government. Using that opportunity in a way that brings Native voices to the table will benefit all constituents of Arizona.

stanforddaily_2022_34,"Recently The Stanford Dailyreportedon a demonstration that took place at the opening of the Doerr School of Sustainability. As one of the demonstrators, I would like to offer my perspective on the event. The demonstration drew attention to the fact thatDoerr has stated it will accept fundingfrom companies that havepublicly pledged to expand extraction and marketing of fossil fuels. We were there to argue that we cannot afford to become entangled with companies who only seek to defer our reckoning with an existential, human-made crisis. We reject the deadly shell game the oil companies are engaged in — using projects like the Doerr School to draw attention away from their destructive actions. Dean Arun Majumdarannouncedthat Doerr would accept money from oil companies, and not engage in “advocacy.” But far from refraining from “advocacy,” by accepting fossil fuel money, Doerr is in fact offering free advertising and a burnished image to these polluters, effectively advocating for them and greenwashing their actions. Just look at thewebpagethat Doerr uses to advertise its energy seminars: in the lower right-hand corner you will find the Chevron logo, captioned with “Thank you for a decade of Energy Seminar sponsorship.” The protest was organized by a group called theCoalition for a True School of Sustainability, which is asking Majumdar to make good on the School’sclaim: ‘We aim to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout the fabric of our educational mission… this community will reflect different worldviews and be attuned to the environmental justice and social issues that are fundamental to fruitful learning and lead to better scientific solutions for our planet.” We marched to the event, planning to speak at 4:15 p.m. and end before the President was slated to make his comments. We stood in a cordoned-off area, a grassy knoll beneath the deck of Mitchell Earth Sciences, where the reception was taking place. We announced our program and began making our remarks. Though we used bullhorns to try to make our voices heard above the music at the reception, that music and the chatter of the celebrants guaranteed that few people heard what we were saying, and not a single person left the deck to come down to hear us. Finally, we demanded that they turn off the music and allow us to finish. Now you will say, well, it was a reception, after all. It was their party. Why “interrupt”? And—perhaps most importantly, “what did you expect?” Put plainly, for us and millions globally, business-as-usual is no longer an option. We hoped that Doerr would act as it said it would act — that is, inclusively. But Doerr chose not to listen to us, preferring to drown out our voices and have the party continue. For us, this is a vivid metaphor for the way those in power have chosen to deal with the climate catastrophe. Too many schools, organizations, and governments have bought the oil companies’ bogus narrative that this crisis can be adequately addressed by channeling energy and money into miscellaneous, small fixes that allow fossil fuel companies to continue to drill, extract, and market their product unimpeded. Last year, the U.S. Congress felt it was time to know more about the proliferation of climate misinformation. House Oversight and Reform Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-NY subpoenaed four major oil companies,saying, “I see no choice but to continue our committee’s investigation until we see the truth.” The oil companies were not exactly forthcoming.Scientific Americanreported: The committee initially requested documents by Sept. 30 (Greenwire, Sept. 16 . When the companies did not fully comply, Maloney said, they were warned that the panel would take further action if they did not produce sufficient paper ahead of yesterday’s hearing. “Unfortunately, none of the six entities can produce the substantial portion of the key documents the committee requested,” Maloney said. “Instead, they produced reams of other documents, many of which were publicly available.” In other words, fossil fuel companies stonewalled the committee. In anopinion piece, Robert J. Brulle noted that the investigation would likely do more than expose the role of oil companies in spreading climate misinformation — he believed “a raft of other major industries are equally complicit”: In 1988, the dramatic testimony of Dr. James Hansen established the reality and dangers of continued increases in carbon emissions and called for government action to address global warming. In response, corporations with strong ties to the production and use of fossil fuels — acting in coordination with trade associations, conservative think tanks, conservative philanthropic foundations and public relations firms — mounted sophisticated and effective lobbying and public relations efforts to obstruct political action on climate. For over 33 years, these efforts have successfully blocked meaningful legislation and regulation of carbon emissions, both in the United States and at the global level. The result is that theworld is on a courseto likely catastrophic climate change. Activists like myself believe that schools like Doerr that accept fossil fuel money instead of staying true to their educational function and commitment to neutral and unbiased science join this corporate cadre. Now, what did the investigation yield? On Sept. 14, just two weeks ago, in a Congressional Memorandum, the committeedisclosedwhat many of us suspected all along: Despite knowing the truth about climate change, fossil fuel companies continued to contradict prevailing scientific knowledge and inject confusion into the public debate over climate change… At the Committee’s historic hearing in October 2021, fossil fuel executives finally admitted under oath that climate change is real, that burning fossil fuels contributes to it, and that this is an existential threat to the planet. Yet none of them would pledge to end their financial support for efforts to block meaningful action on climate change. One particular piece of evidence stands out: An internal Shell messaging guidance urges Shell employees, “Please do not give the impression that Shell is willing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to levels that do not make business sense.” As Stanford alum and Harvard professor Naomi Oreskes writes inScientific American: Funding strongly influences what kinds of scientific questions are asked and what kinds of answers are deemed plausible, credible and worthy of further pursuit. Amplescientific evidencedemonstratesthatthe interests of funders influence academic findings, even when researchers strive to be objective. These and other concerns were brought to Doerr’s attention by the Coalition. No reply. And Stanford has remained silent. For some reason, both have placed their trust in fossil fuel companies, and in dismissing this issue, Stanford is shamefully behind the curve. Right now, Cambridge University isholding a university-wide vote on the issue. Luke Kemp, a researcher who studiesclimate riskat Cambridge and one of the academics who called for the votesaid, “By working with the fossil fuel industry, we’re giving them legitimacy and we’re implicitly endorsing them… This should be utterly uncontroversial for any academic who is clearly and truly concerned about climate change.” Most importantly, Princeton University has alreadydeclared a banon accepting money from fossil fuel companies. The Princeton Board of Trustees has voted to dissociate from 90 companies pursuant to afossil fuel dissociation decision made last yearthat focused on the most-polluting segments of the industry and on concerns about corporate disinformation campaigns. Indeed, Princeton has decided to rely solely on its own resources — financial and intellectual — to address this critical issue, and it got to this point by actually listening. The Princeton Office of Communications issued thisstatement: The board’s vote is the culmination of a community-initiated two-year process that included input from stakeholders across the campus community. The University will also establish a new fund to support energy research at Princeton, in part to offset research funding no longer available because of dissociation. “Princeton will have the most significant impact on the climate crisis through the scholarship we generate and the people we educate,” said President Christopher L. Eisgruber. “The creation of this new fund is one of several ways that the University is helping to provide Princeton researchers with the resources they need to pursue this work.” Doerr and Stanford have a choice — will they be willing partners with the oil industry, accepting theirwell-documented misinformationas fact and their money as clean? Or will they try the Princeton model, and be financially and intellectually independent? As my colleagues on the faculty and administration gleefully swilled their glasses of chardonnay and nibbled on cheese, I looked at the faces of the young people standing next to me and thought — here’s the difference: faculty and administrators can be complacent. They have well-paying jobs, their children have been raised and likely their mortgages are paid off. Several have industry funding and pet projects to work on. All this, plus the fact that older people have been fortunate to live the vast majority of our years with clean air and water. Lucky us. But the torrid summer we just experienced is likely to be the coolest one we will ever have. It saddens me that too many of my colleagues lack the will or empathy to understand what kind of planet we are leaving to those who are just starting their adult lives — the very people we have taken the responsibility to teach to be honest: ethical researchers and scholars. In fact, these young people are more mature than we are — history has forced them to grow up at a much faster rate than we had to, in order to confront what we are energetically avoiding by doing business as usual. It is their lives, and their futures, that are most at stake. It seems it is they who are teaching us the most important lessons today. The question is–are we really going to listen?

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_10,"Willa, an online payments company that caters to social media creators, has launched an airline calledWilla Airto better support influencers. On April 15, its first voyage offered 12 content creators a free and exclusive flight to this month’s Coachella festival in the Empire Polo Club. However, the problem with Willa Air is exactly that: it caters to the rich, which amplifies the friction between the nation’s wealthiest and those living paycheck to paycheck. Willa launched in 2019 with the goal of helping content creators handle transactions with their clients. Now, the company has expanded its services to include an exclusive airline for social content creators who are at least 18 years old. While Willa has not specified what it considers a content creator to be, the application on its website requires an Instagram handle. Travel Noirereports that the 12 guests willenjoydrinks at a pre-flight champagne bar, breakfast at Willa’s Venice Beach lounge massages and more. It would not be far-fetched to say that Willa Air is a private jet. Both socially and environmentally, there is no difference between an exclusive flight for 12 young adults, enhanced by luxury meals, free alcohol and a private aircraft for politicians. Thus, the controversy that surrounds Willa Air follows the same issues other private jet companies face. Research from Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based campaign, shows that “private jets are five to 14 times more pollutingthan commercial planes (per passenger .” The report also found that European private plane emissions rose 31% between 2005 and 2019, as opposed to the 25% increase for commercial aviation. The spike in private emissions is caused by the wealthy’s decision to continue flying during pandemic restrictions, a trend that affected the United States as well, whereemissions from private jets rose from 6.3 to 7.9%. To make matters worse, private jets are never flown at full capacity, which means that the emissions they produce are wasted because fewer passengers are on board. Private jets also fly around empty because they need to travel from location to location to pick up the next passengers, meaning that they waste more carbon than they should. By contrast, commercial flights, which carry up to hundreds of passengers, are akin to carpools. Willa Air, like many before it, deepens the divide between the rich and the average man. The separation stems not just from the fact that these rich celebrities enjoy luxuries the general population can only dream of, but also from the manner in which these rich individuals tarnish the environment yet suffer no consequences. In 2020, a report compiled by Oxfam and the Stockholm Environment Institute found that the “richest 10% of the global population are responsible for 52% of global emissions.” This contributes to the notion that to be wealthy is to exist with near impunity and furthers the social divide between the classes. Shouldn’t those with economic and social power be more responsible for protecting the environment and upholding moral standards? One way these rich private jet owners can lessen their impact is through alternative fueling for their jets. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF is a promising alternative. SAF is made fromrenewable resources, so it flies just as well as a petroleum-powered plane while producing fewer greenhouse gasses. Most notably, SAF helped the aviation sector fulfill its mission. In 2009, the International Air Transport Associationpledged to cut CO2 emissions by half by 2050. At the time, the idea seemed far-fetched, but the Waypoint 2050 report in 2020 showed that the goal has beenreached. Even more importantly, the report confirmed that achieving net-zero emissions by 2060 is possible. The factors that helped IATA reach its goals were lighter aircraft, hydrogen and electric-powered aircraft, and SAF; however, out of these three,“Waypoint 2050 has identified SAF as a key driver of change”, reducing emissions by 50 to 75%. Adopting this method would give those who have private jets a chance to show the public that they care about the earth and its inhabitants. However, there’s doubt that Willa Air will consider SAF because there is no pushback from activists, and its aim, as told by Willa Air Co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Aron Levin himself, is tosupport the rich. Like many wealthy companies before and after it, Willa Air will continue to make money by profiting off the planet, and it will broaden the divide between the rich and the underprivileged.

wildcat_arizona_2022_76,"Environmentalists gather to protest climate change in El Presidio Park in downtown Tucson, Arizona., on Friday, Sept. 20, 2019. After an alarming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was released this past week, videos of scientists protesting around the world have since gone viral across all social media platforms. Including one ofNASA’s climate scientistsPeter Kalmus pleading, “we’re going to lose everything. We’re not joking. We’re not lying and we’re not exaggerating,” as he stood outside of the JP Morgan building in Los Angeles. Most college students understand the devastating impacts of climate change and the action that needs to be taken to mitigate irreversible damage. The protests across the world over this last week have been scary and many feel like they need to begin contributing to help be a part of the solution to this ongoing crisis. However, several do not know where to begin, how to take action or how to get involved. Fortunately, Earth Day 2022 is on April 22 and there are several upcoming events where students can learn how to take action in their individual lives and on a larger level. Earth Day is a significant holiday each year because it’s used to acknowledge the problems our society faces with climate change while also encouraging more support across the globe for protecting our environment and creating positive change. Earth Day is extremely crucial in regard to the climate emergency because, in order to legislate fundamental change, our governments must realize the urge to have environmental issues be at the head of policy decisions. At the University of Arizona organizations like Students For Sustainability and UA Divest are planning events centered around Earth Day throughout the week that are open to all students. Even if students are not a part of these organizations, it is important that all take time to educate themselves on the climate crisis and ways that they can improve their individual lives in order to live more sustainably. It is equally important to learn about ways that we can all advocate for sustainable practices in the local, national and global communities. Someeventsthat are occurring this upcoming week include an environmental summit on April 21 at 11 a.m. at the UA Alumni Plaza and the UA Mall stage. According to UA SFS, the summit allows students to, “meet the student organizations, institutes, and community groups behind the scenes and listen to speakers.” There is also an Earth Day Panel discussion on April 22 at 1 p.m. in room S107 in the UA’s Environmental and Natural Resources 2 building. Climate change and the crisis that we are currently in right now is something we cannot face alone. Everyone can find a role to play in this fight. There are multiple methods to reduce your own personal footprint and there are also many ways to get involved at the community level. It is important that we begin to get involved in any way possible, no matter what we study or where we are. If you need more information on the impacts of climate change, resources for combating climate change or how to get involved and educated, the UA has several resources to reach out to, including theOffice of Sustainability,UA SFSandUA Divest.

crimson_2022_48,"Claudine Gay’s appointment as the first person of color andthe first Black woman president of Harvard Universityis a historic moment for representation in higher education. But Harvard needs more than symbolic change. Given the massive wealth and power that the University holds, Gay’s incoming administration must address the systemic issues that perpetuate inequality and injustice at Harvard. We are deeply concerned about how the administration will respond to the needs of the Harvard community moving forward, given its record ofinaction on sexual violence,ambiguous efforts to redress its legacy of slavery,hostility towards the labor movement, andslowness on divestment. This record has harmed our campus in real ways that must be addressed immediately. First, under the current administration,issues of sexual violence, harassment, and discriminationabound. The Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers and the undergraduate advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better have made passionatecalls for real recourse, but they have been met with resistance. In fact, Harvard professor and accused sexual harasser John L. Comaroff resumed teaching this semester despite being put on temporary unpaid leave with Gay’s approval. Second, it is unclear how Harvard will concretely address itslegacy of slavery. The University has a long history of benefiting from the exploitation and enslavement of Black and Indigenous people, asits own reportshave shown. After several years (and even more committees , it is time to put the University’s$100 millionpledge to work by publicly providing reparations, such as cash payments to descendants of enslaved people and the return of Indigenous lands. Third, despite the significant contributions of its workers, Harvard has consistently failed to acknowledge the legitimate demands of its labor force. The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers hascalled for higher wages, dining services workers have demandedbalanced staffing for hot breakfastacross all Houses, and, as mentioned above, HGSU’s Feminist Working Group haspushed for real recoursefor survivors of harassment and discrimination. These requests can no longer be dismissed. Gay is one of the few administrators on campus who had a hand in controversial high-profile sexual misconduct cases such as Comaroff’s. Perhaps that made her a comfortable insider pick for the University’s next president. But as she enters her presidency, she cannot remain complacent. Gay’s administration must address Harvard’s existing issues and create new meaningful changes. The new administrationmust acknowledgethe lack of transparency surrounding its endowment investments, including its past (and potentially present participation in a prison-industrial complex withclose historical ties to slavery. The new administration must divest from industries that contribute to social inequality and environmental destruction, heeding the advice of student-led activist groups like theHarvard Prison Divestment Campaign,Palestine Solidarity Committee, andFossil Fuel Divest Harvard. The new administration mustreturn Native American remainsto their descendants as a gesture of respect and acknowledgment of the harm inflicted on these communities. The new administration mustprioritize diversityin its hiring practices. The new administration must continue to provide support and resources to students, particularly those disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. Finally, as the Supreme Court appears poised toend race-conscious admissionspractices, Gay’s Harvard must aggressively recruit students from diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds. The appointment of Gay to the presidency is a cause for celebration in many ways, but we must also recognize that this was a relatively safe choice for Harvard. Gay’s appointment marks the third consecutive time Harvard boosted a high-ranking insider to the presidency. Students will not believe that a pick approved by the administration is the best choice for them if they are asking the administration to reconsider its relationship with the Harvard community. As president, Gay’s decisions to enact reforms — including her choice of replacement for FAS dean — will signal her loyalty or lack thereof to the status quo. Our community can only move forward by addressing the structural issues that perpetuate inequality and injustice at Harvard — a truth we academics often acknowledge but hardly put into practice. Symbolic representation is not enough. If Claudine Gay wants to be a good president of Harvard University, she must set the tone with decisive, concrete action.

Visitwww.sapaac.org(Stanford Asian Pacific American Alumni Club to find out more about the coalition’s efforts to advocate for Asian American Studies at Stanford. Read previous entrieshereandhere. Hope Nakamura ’83 is a public interest lawyer at the Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County and a past SAPAAC board member and president. While on campus, she co-chaired the Asian American Students’ Association (AASA , served as the Asian American intern at DOSA, and participated in the Asian American Theater Project’s 1979 production of “FOB.” I entered Stanford in 1978. At the time, about six to seven percent of the undergraduate students identified as Asian Americans. One of my reasons for choosing Stanford over other colleges was the presence of an Asian American theme dorm. Growing up in Los Angeles, I went to a high school that was racially diverse thanks to busing, though I didn’t live in a predominantly Asian community. Except for learning about the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans by our own U.S. government during WWII, I didn’t know much about Asian Americans. As I continued my academic journey by attending Stanford, I hoped to explore my identity as a third-generation Japanese American, and how it fit into my vague notion of building a better world. Once I arrived on the Farm, though, I was disappointed to find there were no courses that examined the history of Asian immigrants in the U.S. Instead, I had to explore Asian American history outside the classroom, through Junipero (the Asian American theme dorm before it was renamed Okada House , the Asian American Student Association (AASA , and other Asian American student organization activities. I spent most of my extracurricular time at the Asian American Activities Center (A3C organizing student events, or working on AA issues off-campus, both in the Asian American community and on other university campuses. We supported efforts to oppose thedisplacement of Chinatown residentsanddestructive commercial redevelopment of Japantown. During my time at Stanford, Black/African American, Chicano/Latinx, Native American, and Asian American students worked together to draw attention to disparities we experienced on campus and in our communities off-campus. Organizations of students of color were constantly urging Stanford to live up to its stated commitment to diversity by providing resources to support minority students, who were often marginalized. Although there was a Dean of Student Affairs for Black students, the other communities of color had no full-time staff — only student interns — to provide a voice for their community in the Office of Student Affairs. The University made no effort to develop any Asian American Studies courses. The one AA class available to me and other students was one that students themselves organized and taught through the Stanford Workshops on Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI . This continued to be the case for many years. After graduating, I worked with others in the Stanford Asian Pacific American Alumni Club (SAPAAC to support the growing student demand for Asian American Studies, which resulted inthe establishmentof the Comparative Studies in Race & Ethnicity (CSRE program. But since that high point, we have seen the AAS program at Stanford surpassed by AAS departments at other colleges and universities in California and across the country. This disparity is not from lack of faculty talent, but rather an apparent lack of conviction on the part of the administration. For over four decades, Stanford has never clearly signaled that ethnic studies is a vital academic pursuit worthy of institutional support. Consequently, our AAS program has been unable to attract and retain more than a handful of leading Asian Pacific American scholars. Why is it important to offer a more robust program? I am a lawyer working in the field of poverty law. Understanding the history of discrimination and racist policies aimed at different racial and ethnic minority communities over decades is critical to determining how policies and laws need to change if we are to address the growing disparities between the rich and poor in our country. However, there is little research that disaggregates the diverse Asian/Pacific Islander data being collected by state and federal agencies, which might help government and nonprofits better target anti-poverty policy and services. We also continue to see the role race plays in keeping communities divided. Even Asian/Pacific Islander professionals, who have economic advantages, have come to realize that racism and discrimination affect their lives, whether it is the “bamboo ceiling” that they experience when trying to get promoted, or the anti-Asian violence that has escalated since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the recent Black Lives Matter reckoning, we are, perhaps, finally recognizing that racism remains a deep-seated problem that continues to feed inequality and division. Understanding this history and connecting it to contemporary concerns is the pathway to change. As Provost Persis Drellrecently acknowledged, Stanford has a role to play in increasing research and teaching about race on the path to overcoming racism and inequality in our world. This includes addressing the racism and inequality affecting Asian Americans and other communities of color in the United States. If the University actually believes that addressing race and inequality is a priority, it’s time to back up good intentions with real action. Stanford must seize this opportunity to make meaningful progress by allocating enough University resources to provide Asian American Studies and other ethnic studies programs at Stanford with sufficient numbers of tenured faculty to build leading centers of research and study. Alumni are willing to support this effort, but the University itself must step up now. We’ve been waiting long enough.

stanforddaily_2022_113,"— Tim MacKenzie is a postdoc in the genetics department. He completed his Ph.D. in the chemistry department at Stanford. Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne and Provost Persis Drell recentlyannounceda series of steps to address the ongoing affordability crisis facing the Stanford community and larger Bay Area. The announcement centered the recommendations made by theAffordability Task Force, created in spring quarter of2018, and “are made possible by the exceptional investment returns Stanford achieved last year.” In reality, these recent announcements are the result of tireless advocacy by student activists for many years. In late 2016, I turned 26 and was no longer eligible to stay on my parents’ health-insurance plan. Suddenly the money that I had been able to put toward student loans went to Cardinal Care premiums instead. As several of us talked in the chemistry department, we learned that the full cost of health-insurance premiums was covered in some departments but not others. The net effect was a pay disparity of several thousand dollars. We decided to circulate a petition in the summer of 2017 calling on the University to subsidize Cardinal Care premiums for all graduate students. More than half of the department signed in favor. In fall quarter of 2017, we delivered our petition to administrators at every level. The Dean of Humanities and Sciences, the Provost and the President all received the petition on the same day. We talked with our Department Chair and various Vice Provosts. No one was aware of the disparity in health-insurance coverage across departments. No matter whom we talked to, though, they never had any power or responsibility to handle the situation. A circular firing squad was created as lower levels of the administration pointed us up higher, while higher levels pointed us lower. To build support across the graduate student population, we delivered the petition to theGraduate Student Council. In areporton a Graduate Life Survey conducted by GSC delivered in April of 2018, a month before the creation of the Affordability Task Force, student activists called on the University to cover the costs of premiums for Cardinal Care for all graduate students. Even though we were asking for coverage for all graduate students, administrators told us that individual departments held responsibility for this issue. In the spring of 2018, two of us who were involved with the petition gave apresentationat a chemistry department faculty meeting. Our goal was to enlist faculty support in petitioning the administration to prioritize covering health-insurance premiums for graduate students. We continued to advocate and engage with administrators in town halls and closed-door meetings. Slowly, the students who formed the faces of the campaign — who tended to skew older, as younger students were more worried about retaliation — defended their theses and left Stanford. In one of my last meetings with the Provost as a graduate student, I was told that Stanford had no plans to cover health-insurance premiums for all graduate students, even though there was majority support in the chemistry department. No other departments were speaking up, so the issue wasn’t a priority. Nevermind that we were told to advocate at the department level. Nevermind that GSC had called on the University to cover health-insurance premiums for all graduate students. As I transitioned to my postdoc, I met with student activists in the physics and applied physics departments, two departments that also didn’t cover the cost of Cardinal Care premiums. We discussed the lessons learned from our efforts in the chemistry department, and how they could carry advocacy forward. The administration also pointed to fairness as a reason not to cover the costs of Cardinal Care premiums for all departments. Many of the departments that covered the costs of health-insurance premiums did not pay graduate students as much, so the administration claimed the apparent inequity was an illusion. That situation changed when student activists with the Stanford Solidarity Network led acampaignthat resulted in five full years of fundingguaranteedfor graduate students in all departments. Following that victory, SSN joined a coalition of other campus groups to present aRoadmap to Reopening with Justice and Equityin the COVID era. With the detailed and thoughtful recommendations, there was once more a united call from student activists to completely cover the costs of Cardinal Care premiums. The following spring, GSCcalledfor the University to provide coverage of Cardinal Care for all departments. In this academic year’s fall quarter, GSC made full coverage of Cardinal Care premiums an advocacypriority, continuing what had turned into a years-long tradition. After years of students advocating for coverage of Cardinal Care premiums and being denied, the administration finally changed the policy without any recognition of the work done by student advocates. My story is just one aspect of advocacy from many other graduate students through the years. Behind each action taken by the administration is the thankless work of countless advocates who fought for changes they never got to see. The expansion of family grants responds toyearsofadvocacyfightingforaffordabilityforfamilies. Since becoming a postdoc, I’ve joinedSURPASand advocated upon a foundation laid by generations of trainees before me. Postdocs are often left out of University initiatives and have been calledsecond-class citizensat Stanford, but the advocacy of SURPAS made sure our needs were considered as well. Trainee activists are the ones who have relentlessly raised issues to decision-makers and forced our concerns to become a priority for the administration. Stanford’s record investment returns did allow for more action on affordability topics than typically seen at once. But the decision of how to spend those returns is always a question of priorities. Even during the height of uncertainty at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when staff salaries werefrozenfor nearly two years, Stanford could move forward with thecreationof a new school. Organized student voices, however, can change policy. Around the same time as the budget freeze, the administrationpromisedfive years of funding to all graduate students in the face of an organized, cross-departmental movement. Advocates can be much more effective when armed with knowledge of the sources of money at the University, but the conversation of how money flows to and from the operating budget versus the endowment is an entirely different can of worms. That conversation is for another day — today is a time to recognize the true reason material conditions have improved for graduate students and postdocs: trainee activism.

state_press_2022_38,"ASU s endowment is handled by BlackRock, a firm that has only invigorated the climate crisis even though ASU characterizes BlackRock as a sustainable organization. While ASU claims to be a sustainable institution, its endowment is run byBlackRock, a perpetrator of carbon emissions, and ASU s strategy of using carbon offsets to reach net-zero goals is dubious at best. ASU s$1.25 billion endowment is an important source of funding, and is made up of recurring gifts the University invests to create long-term revenue. ASU claims its endowment is a source of sustainable and green funding. One of the reasons used to support these claims is that its outsourced chief investment officer is BlackRock, a global investments manager that manages over $10 trillion in assets. According toASU s endowment website, BlackRock is a sustainable leader. Like ASU, BlackRock has been a leader for sustainability and environmentally responsible practices, the website says. However, BlackRock s past and current realities signify the opposite: BlackRock is responsible for financing greenhouse gas emitting sources and militarism around the world. According toBlackRock s Big Problem, a coalition that includes Amazon Watch, CODEPINK and the Indigenous Environmental Network, BlackRock is a primary investor in organizations contributing to the deforestation of the Amazon. New York City put BlackRock, which it uses for asset management, under review for possibly straying from minimum climate standards, and BlackRockbraggedin February about being a primary investor in fossil fuels. ASU s claims of BlackRock being a sustainable organization are flat-out lies. These lies attempt to bring truth to themythof green capitalism, which says an economic system based on domination, exploitation and bigotry, can somehow be environmentally friendly. ...the relationship may evolve as our asset base grow, an ASU spokesperson said in a statement. Not only does ASU use a polluting, war-profiteering capitalist firm as its investment officer, it utilizes a dubious-at-best strategy to deal with its carbon emissions. READ MORE:How ASU bought its way to carbon neutrality ASU s primary strategy for sustainability is based on carbon offsets.The University haspaidthousands to different organizations that utilize different methods to reduce carbon emissions. There are multiple issues associated with carbon offsets, but the tactic itself has been argued to be ineffective by activists and scientists alike. Reducing ASU s carbon emissions has been and remains our overriding objective; yet, carbon offsets provide a bridge to addressing our remaining campus emission sources. We are working to purchase carbon offsets that are credible, high-quality and fiscally responsible, an ASU spokesperson said. Scientists havearguedthat net zero is an ineffectual term that allows the fossil fuel industry to keep polluting while changing little about the operations that got us to this cataclysmic point in the first place. In the United States, historically the world s greatest emitter of carbon emissions, the system that got us here is capitalism. Corporations and organizations such as BlackRock will frequently greenwash their practices, or, in other words, pretend the actions that exploit the natural environment and make them money are somehow sustainable. Anything that will fall under this same capitalistic model where people are just finding a way to profit off of carbon, I mean, that s a serious red flag right away, said Teddy Ogborn, the War is Not Green coordinator at CODEPINK. CODEPINK, a women-led grassroots organization dedicated to taking on militarism, supporting human rights and redirecting resources to life-affirming programs, has campaigned against BlackRock for its ties to weapons companies and the fossil fuel industry. BlackRock has investments in Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, two military weapons contractors that contribute to the proliferation of war around the world. Raytheon and Lockheed Martin sell weapons to the U.S. and Saudi Arabia,both of whichhave used thoseweaponsto commit atrocities. The US military also emits more carbon per capita than many industrialized countries. (BlackRock will speak out against coal companies and oil companies in a symbolic way, but when it comes to weapons manufacturers, they will not say a word, said Nancy Mancias, a campaign organizer at CODEPINK. Like BlackRock, ASU s rhetoric advances the green language companies like BlackRock utilize. But, of course, both institutions fail because they seek to do the impossible – to reconcile capitalism and the climate crisis it created. Until this contradiction is acknowledged and other routes forward are taken, ASU and BlackRock will continue to add to the blood on their hands. BlackRock s capabilities in sustainable investing are recognized as industry leading. However, the scope of the work of BlackRock is in no way related to or has any effect on the efforts by the university to achieve net zero carbon emissions in its operations. It is an investment firm unrelated to ASU’s sustainability operations, an ASU spokesperson said. Despite BlackRock supposedly not being related to ASU s sustainability operations, ASU still supports the firm through the partnership. The time to act on the climate crisis is dwindling. As the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changereportsaid, Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all. The Young Democratic Socialists of America at ASUled a Green New Deal divestment campaign last year, and ASU students would be wise to push for another.

rice_thresher_2022_37,"ByThresher Editorial Board4/12/22 11:03pm On Dec. 26 of last year, President David Leebron and future president Reginald DesRoches sent an email to the Rice community regarding plans for this spring semester. The email proclaimed that Rice had “entered a new and different phase of the pandemic.” Specifically, the email stated that the university would “begin to shift our policies to a posture that recognizes COVID-19 as endemic and facilitates our ability to deliver the best education and opportunity to our students, while still taking reasonable precautions.” While we understand that the cancellation of public parties scheduled for the rest of the semester was deemed necessary due to the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases on campus in the last 10 days, we find that decision is not reflective of the endemic outlook professed in the Dec. 26 email, nor is it consistent with the thorough communication that we have seen from administration up to this point. The call for “reasonable precautions” in the Dec. 26 email has not been heeded. The campuswide testing requirement was eliminated on Feb. 10, and at no point before Beer Bike were students or alumni asked to take a rapid test toconfirm they weren’t contagious. Eliminating social activities for multiple weeks after a sudden rise in cases is the definition of reactive, not proactive. The way we see it, the removal of a testing regimen was inevitably going to lead to a rise in cases on campus — though it should be noted, no such rise occurred until after hundreds of alumni descended on campus during Beer Bike Week. Antigen testing should be required ahead of large events, in the interest of preventing the sudden and uncontrolled spread we saw begin last week. And if a spike in cases does occur, provided there is no evidence of severe illness, those who test negative should be allowed to attend events and those who test positive should isolate, in the same way that someone who has the flu or a cold shouldn’t attend a public party in the first place. Implicit in the Dec. 26 email is the notion that COVID-19 is not going anywhere and there will continue to be waves of cases on campus. Canceling social activities for the final two weeks of the semester in response to an entirely predictable and preventable spike in cases after Beer Bike does not reflect the endemic policies outlined in that email. We should be proactive in preventing these waves by requiring negative antigen test results before large gatherings, otherwise we’ll enter a continuous cycle of haphazard policy implementations every time a big event causes a spike in cases.

As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25.

stanforddaily_2022_18,"It seems to be theperfect founding story: 19-year-old Stanford dropouts who get their big break throughsomeone they met at a frat party. The Social Network 2.0 playing out before our very eyes. But these are entrepreneurs who have access to an inordinate amount of highly sensitive informationabout their peers and young people all over the country through their app Fizz, which promises anonymity to its meme-making, confession-posting users. In light of Fizz’s recent$4.5 million funding round, students at Stanford — and at every single one of the more than 1,000 campuses that Fizz intends to launch at — should know that Fizz was hacked last year by three Stanford students. Aditya Saligrama ’24, Miles McCain ’24 and Cooper de Nicola ’22 M.S. ’23 told mein an emailthat they investigated Fizz’s security on the evening of Nov. 5, 2021, after they were “initially concerned by Fizz’sstrong public claims of total anonymity.”I had reached out to one of the students in early fall quarter after a mutual friend told me that Fizz had apparently been hacked last year. Saligrama, McCain and de Nicola all have professional experience in cybersecurity and have previously performed dozens of security vulnerability disclosures. They had no prior relationship with Fizz or its founders, Teddy Solomon and Ashton Cofer. Seeing the number of highly sensitive and personal posts made by fellow students on the app, they realized that “if a security vulnerability could result in the deanonymization of posts, that information could be extremely harmful to Stanford students.” Hoping to ensure Fizz users’ safety and “intending to inform their founders about any potential vulnerabilities,” the team began to dig. Here is what they told me they found, as they wrote in their October 2022 email(emphasis added : “At the time, Fizz used Google’s Firestore database product to store data including user information and posts. Firestore can be configured to use a set of security rules in order to prevent users from accessing data they should not have access to. However,Fizz did not have the necessary security rules set up, making it possible for anyone to query the database directly and access a significant amount of sensitive user data. We found thatphone numbers and/or email addresses for all users were fully accessible, and that posts and upvotes were directly linkable to this identifiable information.It was possible to identify the author of any post on the platform. Moreover, the database was entirely editable —it was possible for anyone to edit posts, karma values, moderator status, and so on. Having moderator status granted access to a dashboard that provided the ability to delete arbitrary posts.” The team said they “notified Fizz about the security vulnerabilities on November 8, 2021,” followingindustry best practices.They said that Fizz initially thanked them for sharing their findings and told them on Nov. 22, 2021 that they “considered the issues fixed.” On the very same day, Nov. 22, Saligrama, McCain and de Nicola received a legal threat from Fizz’s lawyers. “Fizz’s lawyer threatened us with criminal, civil, and disciplinary charges unless we agreed to keep quiet about the vulnerabilities. If we agreed to their demands within five days, they said they would not pursue ‘charges,’” the team told me. The Daily obtained a copy ofthe letter sent by Fizz’s lawyers, which included the following threats (Fizz was called Buzz at the time of this letter : “the security researchers may be liable for fines, damages and each individual of the security research Group may be imprisoned… Criminal penalties under the CFAA can be up to 20 years depending on circumstances.” “the Group’s actions are also a violation of Buzz’s Terms of Use and constitute a breach of contract, entitling Buzz to compensatory damages and damages for lost revenue.” “the Group’s agreement to infiltrate Buzz’s network is also a separate offense of conspiracy, exposing the Group to even more significant criminal liability.” Far from their apparent welcoming of constructive concerns in the nascent stage of their app, Fizz’s founders chose instead to prioritize the preservation of their image — even if that meant violating industry norms and threatening their classmates with decades of jail time. Their actions may discourage future white-hat hackers from disclosing crucial security information about the app. For reference, Google has aVulnerability Reward Programthat awards security researchers several millions of dollars per year “to honor all the cutting-edge external contributions that help us keep our users safe.” The trio did not back down. “The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF generously agreed torepresent uspro bono, and we did not agree to Fizz’s demands. Threatening your classmates with felony charges in an attempt to cover up your mistakes isn’t a good look,” Saligrama, McCain and de Nicola told The Daily. Solomon and Cofer did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this incident and Fizz’s security. Fizz today, with far more money, experience and employees, stores user data more securely than they did a year ago. I have the same praise and concerns about the app itself as I hadlast yearwhen I wrote my first article on the startup.There will surely always be a place for anonymous apps on college campuses, as we’ve seentimeandtimeagain. However, anyone might have less faith that the company’s reactions to scrutiny – driven by the same individuals – can change so easily. Who do you trust to securely handle your data and most personal confessions? Who do you trust to shape your perception of the “true” nature of our campuses and communities? This vulnerability disclosure is just one incident in Fizz’s history, but it provides a deep window into the company’s operations. To name just four major areas of concern: Until all of these issues have been satisfactorily resolved, our trust in Fizz may not be fully restored. Although Fizz released a statement entitled“Security Improvements Regarding Fizz”on Dec. 7, 2021, the page is no longer navigable from Fizz’swebsiteor Google searches as of the time of this article’s publication. In talking to other Fizz users on campus, I found that very few had heard about last year’s incident. Fizz should have kept the statement up and made an official post on the app about the vulnerability when it happened. Surely all users want to be clearly informed when our trust in an app is violated. We want to know that the content and upvotes we see cannot be manipulated in any way by moderators and developers. Moreover, we still don’t know whether our data is internally anonymized. The founderstold The Dailylast year that users are identifiable to developers. Fizz’sprivacy policyimplies that this is still the case, for example stating that they may share “certain information” if “we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Fizz or others.” Although the privacy policy does not specify what this user information may be, it also states that Fizz has “collected Personal Information in the following categories”, which may include: “identifiers such as real name, alias, … Internet Protocol address, email address, account name”; “financial or health information”; “browsing history, search history, and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with an Internet Web site or application.” Clearly it would be disastrous if someone with malicious intentions were to access this information. I sincerely hope that Fizz’s founders will not react so aggressively in response to future good-faith vulnerability disclosures and scrutiny more broadly. Fizz can only sustainably improve if its leaders listen and remain accountable to these many college communities. Anything less could pose massive risk to Fizz users and the future of the app. Joyce Chen ‘25 is the chair of the Editorial Board for Vol. 263.

crimson_2022_33,"In 1630, John Winthrop voiced his dreams to the settlers of New England, exclaiming that their new Massachusetts Bay Colony “shall be as a city upon a hill” that “the eyes of all people are upon.” In the nearly 400 years since then, these sentiments,written upon the wallsof Winthrop House, seem to remain a powerful part of how the administration understands this University — the verbalization of an idealistic perception of Harvard’s place in the world. This invocation is not without merit, encouraging faculty and students to hold themselves to a higher standard and to lead with purpose. But there’s a flip side: it renders Harvard’s administration fundamentally concerned with its own public perception, sometimes to a greater extent than — and to the detriment of — its student body. Frommental health resourcestoCovid restrictions, Harvard has historically publicized aggressive policies that represent bold change while quietly maintaining the status quo. It’s almost as if the University is saying, “Look, world, all of our students can test as often as they’d like (though we won t enforce the testing cadence . Look, world, we have created such abundant mental health resources (though CAMHS wait times remain over a month-long .” On the outside, we are a city upon a hill, but upon walking through our gates, one realizes that we are much like any other city. The latest example of the University’s preference for appearance over substance comes with its social plan for this year’s iteration of the Harvard-Yale football game. On November 9, Interim Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 emailed all undergraduate students about the upcoming festivities, writing that the University would be holding an official tailgate featuring “classic American barbecue fare,” “plenty of water stations,” and three drink tickets for students 21 years old or older. This is, of course, a welcome set of resources that contribute to a safer experience for all in attendance, and I am thankful that I go to a university that is willing to contribute to important social experiences like this. Then I read a bit closer. Further down, the email mentioned that “outside food or drink would not be permitted within the tailgate” and that the affair would be “open to current Harvard and Yale undergraduate students only.” Many in attendance will undoubtedly use alcohol or marijuana, but the thousands of students who are under 21, as well as many students from surrounding schools, will have no safe place to do so. Instead, those students will almost certainly engage in rowdy pre-game activity in dorms, yards, or parks far afield of Harvard’s football stadium. This presents a decidedly intolerable risk to students and the community alike. For one, the alternative locations will offer none of the health and safety resources that the official tailgate does. At informal pre-game gatherings, there will likely be zero medical personnel, no guarantee of food or water, and varying accessibility to law enforcement. Additionally, without authorities present, these private parties may very well see physical assault, sexual assault, narcotic use (both voluntary and, worse, involuntary , theft, vandalism, and more. And what happens when The Game is about to start? Thousands of inebriated college students will descend upon the stadium from afar, dodging highways, buses, cars, bikes, and rival fans along the way. Drunk pedestrians are already proportionallymore likelyto die in traffic accidents than even drunk drivers. And the risk of disaster will be even greater with many of the visitors walking through unfamiliar areas. In this respect, Harvard’s policy presents an unacceptably large risk to the lives of students. The2022-2023 College Handbookstates that “in cases of drug or alcohol intoxication, health and safety are the College’s primary concerns,” and that their policies are “intended to encourage students to seek help.” In her recent email, Interim Dean Brandt echoed this sentiment, writing that “there is simply nothing more important than ensuring the safety and well-being of our entire Harvard community and our guests.” While the College’s outward message is consistent, its actual policies fail to consider the safety of the countless students who will inevitably choose to participate in underage drinking and drug use at The Game, clearly appearing to place the health and well-being of students second to the image Harvard works so hard to craft. The University needs to take off its rose-colored glasses and see its students for who they are: stressed young adults who may unintentionally hurt themselves and others in the pursuit of fun. The College must offer practical options for socializing, placing the full force of the richest university in the world behind protecting and nourishing the well-being of its students rather than its image. In truth, Harvard may be a city upon a hill, but to be a worthy model, it must ensure that its example goes beyond appearances. Brad F.

crimson_2022_136,"Dear graduates, Well, it was not what you imagined. If while here you managed to contract a social disease despite appropriate precautions, Covid-19 was not the disease you had in mind. What’s more, if you were somehow involved in a breakthrough, it was not supposed to be a breakthrough infection. And if you dreamed of mastering an art, it was not the art of twirling a wand up your nose. But congratulations all the same! The band is now playing, the crowds have arrived, the platitudes have begun. Hearts are bursting with pride. There is no parking anywhere. If anyone has earned a cap and gown, it is you, and I hope someone has thought to supply crimson masks emblazoned with, if not a Harvard H, then one more Harvard A, why not, in case for all the grade inflation, your GPA could still use inflating. For then it’s out, out with you into the cold, hard world. If you have somehow missed the message that you will now need passion, empathy, and grit, you will now need passion, empathy, and grit. For the world is not only cold and hard but a mess. I’ll leave it to the speakers to go into the details. Let me just say that the world needs you! A lot! Please do not sleep more than is absolutely necessary. Some other advice: Be kind, be kind, be kind. You need not be a doormat. But make people ask what we put in the water here, that Harvard grads are so kind. (Please do not also make them ask what we smoke. Pick the objects of your affection with care, but then love steadily and unstintingly. Wear your heart on your sleeve and wear sunblock, too. And, read books! The greatest technology ever invented is not the internet. It is the book. Out in the cold, hard, messy world, you will not need more information. You will be drowning in information. You will need perspective. Vision. Clarity. Wisdom. And, above all, candor — the kind of candor that comes when people are not writing for clicks. For example, “They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to, but they do.” And: “How dreary—to be— Somebody! How public—like a Frog” And: “…for the world, which seems To lie before us like a land of dreams, So various, so beautiful, so new, Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; And we are here as on a darkling plain Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, Where ignorant armies clash by night.” Ha. Just what you wanted to hear on graduation day. Poets like Philip Larkin and Emily Dickinson and Matthew Arnold are not the only ones who tell it like it is. All real writers do. That is why we see books banned, not just long ago in autocratic nations, but right now, today, in America. But poets help make my case with brevity — and, by the way, are not only bad news bears. They provide inspiration as well. Seamus Heaney observes, for example, with some help from Sophocles: “History says, don’t hope On this side of the grave, But then, once in a lifetime The longed-for tidal wave Of justice can rise up, And hope and history rhyme.” Yes. Hope and history can rhyme. As JFK said, “Art establishes the basic human truths that must serve as the touchstones of our judgment.” Now BS springs eternal, and if you are anything like your forebears, one or two of you may have gotten the hang of piling it higher and deeper. More power to you! It’s a life skill. But without candor, we lose our way. So should you one day find yourself a card-carrying pooh-bah — as some of you just may — and even if you don’t, remember: shoot no messengers, and buy no lines, not even your own. Keep your fingers on your touchstones. Read, read, read. Let the books speak to you. Let them find you. Amanda Gorman was not speaking only of her own book when she wrote: “This book is a message in a bottle. This book is a letter. This book does not let up. This book is awake. This book is a wake.” Read, people, read! And with that I salute you, classes of ’20 and ’21! Congratulations! Enjoy! Respect your elders! Seize the day! Take back the night! Go into the office! Vote! And one more thing, if I may be so candid: save the Harvard-Yale jokes for your 50th reunion. You can absolutely make them work. But they are best delivered bald.

However, ballot initiative processes are under attack, and people in Arizona and across the U.S. should defend their right to direct democracy as they use it to create progressive change. Across the country, propositions protecting abortion rights, voting rights and more passed with strong margins. Abortion rights went 5-0 in a clean sweep of abortion-related propositions in the U.S. including wins in Kentucky, Michigan and Montana. Missouri and Maryland voters legalized marijuana. Illinois voters enshrined collective bargaining in their constitution. South Dakotans expanded Medicaid. Nebraskans voted to gradually increase the state s minimum wage to $15. Michigan voters approved a strong voting rights package. In Arizona, there were largely progressive results, with a few exceptions. READ MORE:Here are the results for the propositions from the 2022 Arizona midterm elections Arizonans voted againstProposition 128, which would have allowed the Legislature to amend ballot initiatives if any part of them were struck down by the state or the U.S. Supreme Court.However, Arizonans approvedProp. 129, which limits ballot measures to a single subject, and they also approvedProp. 132which establishes a requirement for a supermajority vote on any ballot measure that creates new taxes. READ MORE:Opinion: Arizona voters should oppose anti-democratic candidates and propositions The latter two initiatives will make it harder to pass and establish ballot initiatives. The single-subject specification could open up legal challenges to approved initiatives. On the bright side, Arizonans rejected Prop. 309 that would have created a requirement for a voter ID number and eliminated a two-document alternative to providing a photo ID for voting in person, among other restrictions.This proposition would have made it difficult or impossible to vote for many ofArizona s native voters, who have long used tribal ID cards without photos to vote. Outside of voting and ballot initiative-related propositions, Arizonans voted yes on propositions 209 and 211.Prop. 209reduces the interest rate on medical debt to no more than 3%, and it also increases the protected value of people’s primary homes and vehicles from debt collection. The best reforms are rooted in people s real needs. With the problems we ve had with healthcare financing in this country over the last 20 years, and coupled with what s going on in the U.S. with inflation lately, post-pandemic, there was just a sense that this is a place we can make a difference in people’s lives, said Rodd McLeod, a spokesperson for Healthcare Rising Arizona, the organization that helped power Prop. 209 to success. Prop. 211creates more transparency in campaign finance by requiring entities that make campaign expenditures of more than $50,000 in statewide campaigns or $25,000 in other campaigns to disclose the names of the original sources of contributions over $5,000. This proposition leans into the voters right to know when contributors are significantly investing in candidates. I think Americans generally feel like their politics (are oligarchical, and I think there s a lot of evidence that our politics are in fact oligarchical, said Michael McQuarrie, the director of the Center for Work and Democracy at ASU. So when you see an initiative that s designed to make politics more transparent, it s not a surprise that you would have a broad base of bipartisan support. Both Props. 209 and 211 passed by over 70% of the vote. Voters also narrowly approvedProp. 308, which will allow non-citizen residents of Arizona to qualify for in-state tuition at Arizona s state universities and colleges. Voters disapproved ofProp. 310, which would have created a one-tenth of one penny sales tax increase to better fund fire districts, particularly those in rural areas. In terms of the initiatives discussed, Arizonans voted 5-3 in favor of progressive initiatives. Yet, it is possible the Legislature will be fully controlled by the GOP. Electoral politics or representatives basically magnifies divisions on a few discrete issues and is not usually very good at responding to what’s needed or what citizens want, McQuarrie said. Given that voters often vote against the interests of politicians through ballot propositions, it is no surprise some politicians are attacking the proposition method of creating change. According to areportfrom the ASU Center for Work and Democracy about ballot initiatives, economically redistributive initiatives win more than 75% of the time in both conservative and liberal states. However, there are real limits to how much structural change can happen through the ballot initiative process, but organizers can influence who votes and at what rates they vote. What we did this year is we really targeted young people and people of color. The way we did this is we provided education and resources, and we let people know what was on the ballot this year and what was at stake, said Araceli Villezcas, spokesperson for One Arizona. One Arizonais a nonprofit organization that works to improve the lives of Arizonans through civic participation, and a great example of fighting to create change for working people. It sits alongside unions and other forms of organizations such asHealthcare Rising Arizona, which according to McQuarrie, is an excellent example of thinking more broadly about the ecology of working people’s organizations. The ballot proposition has clearly made its mark as a powerful tool for working people to wield in order to create progressive change. ASU students, Arizonans and voters in the U.S. should fight to defend their right to the ballot initiative process, while building and utilizing other forms of power for working people.

thetech_mit_2022_16,"On Oct. 19, MIT’s administration sent an email announcing a “special one-time payment” of $1,500, pre-tax, for some eligible employees, which MIT will provide in response to concerns about inflation and the financial challenges it has posed. The payment is set to be included in December paychecks, but MIT has made no mention of any recurring bonuses in the future. As employees, we are grateful for the payment; however, a stand-alone bonus is not a long-term solution to the rising cost of living. MIT employees need real relief in the form of a cost-of-living adjustment to our salaries. Changes in the actual cost of living in Boston Terra is a long-time employee of the Institute, and Jordan is a newer employee. Comparing situations at the beginning of our tenures at MIT is instructive. Using theCPI calculator at the Bureau of Labor Statistics web site1 , we looked at salary and cost of living increases. Comparing Terra’s starting salary at MIT in 1990 and Jordan’s in 2020, CPI-adjusted, Jordan’s starting salary was similar. However, over the last 32 years, many essential living expenses in this area have increased at a rate far exceeding overall inflation. In 1990, Terra was able to afford to share a four-bedroom Philly-style apartment in the Central Hill area of Somerville with four friends, with rent at $1,250 per month ($250 per person . According to the CPI calculator, that amount adjusts to $2,784 ($557 per person in late-2022 dollars. The rent estimate on Zillow for that same apartment today is $4,964 ($993 per person, now listed as five bedrooms , an additional increase of 78% beyond inflation. That’s in line with the price-per-bedroom cost for apartments in older (ostensibly more affordable housing stock in the area today. It’s possible to find less expensive housing outside of the Boston metro area, but then it becomes necessary to take the commuter rail ($90-$426 for a monthly pass, which is only 60% subsidized by MIT, as opposed to the monthly T pass, which is fully subsidized, or drive. The inflation-adjusted price of the used car Terra bought in 1987 is $5,165 in late-2022 dollars. A search of later-model used cars today shows that the prices of similar vehicles start at around $10,000. For employees, the cost of parking on campus is capped at $1,995, or about $166 per month, and the average cost of gas has also risen faster than the rate of inflation, if only by a relatively modest 24%. Factor in the time spent commuting as well, and the savings from living outside the city are greatly reduced. According toan October 2022 article in Money2 , overall inflation from October 2021 to October 2022 was 8.2%. Meanwhile, grocery prices are up 13% during that time period, and natural gas is up 33.1%. At the same time, we have expenses that are considered essential that simply did not exist 30 years ago, such as cell phones and home broadband service. The impact on employees The rising cost of living has required employees to make difficult decisions. Some have had to find second jobs to make sure their bills are paid. Some have felt like they need to leave MIT for a higher-paying role despite wanting to stay at the Institute. Until September 2022, Jordan lived in an unsanitary apartment covered in cat litter with three other roommates, two of whom she felt unsafe or uncomfortable around, because it was the only way she could afford paying rent while still saving money. The toll these living conditions had on her mental health was beyond what she had ever experienced. Despite this, she still second-guessed whether leaving to live in a safer, more sanitary environment would be feasible because her rent would double and eat into two years of savings. MIT employees should not have to sacrifice our wellbeing or leave the jobs we love in order to get by. MIT is a resourceful institution capable of making a massive impact on the quality of our lives. Providing employees relief would also be mutually beneficial for MIT and those who work here. Employees would suffer less burnout and perform more efficiently if we weren’t constantly worried about finances, working extra hours at other jobs, or wishing we had the wiggle room to afford things that contribute to our wellbeing. We could focus more on the needs of our students if we were not so overwhelmed by our own needs. Employee retention would be greater if employees didn’t feel like they had no other choice but to leave due to financial burdens. Without relief, other than the one-time payment, stress and tension will continue to grow. Conclusion MIT’s annual merit raises have been holding steady in the vicinity of three percent for at least three decades. On average, this has been barely enough to keep pace with inflation, and certainly not enough to keep pace with the actual cost of living in the Boston metro. It is past time for MIT to start offering cost of living increases rather than just merit raises and address job performance as a separate issue. We know that MIT has financial resources available for this type of expenditure because MIT just gave a significant raise, on the order of up to 20%, to our Postdoctoral Associates starting Jan. 1, 2023, which the Institute will subsidize for the first year. Working at MIT wasn’t always so stressful, and it doesn’t have to be this way now. To this end, the MIT Student Worker Alliance has put forth a petition calling for a six percent Cost-of-Living Adjustment increase for all employees, to begin to address our rapidly increasing cost of living. A full-time salary at MIT should be sufficient to support a person in a clean, safe, and hospitable home without their needing to subsidize it with one or more additional jobs. We should not need to spend a large proportion of our waking non-working hours commuting. We should be able to pay our bills while also having time and energy for our families, friends, interests, and public service. These things make us better workers and better people and are simply part of basic human dignity. If you agree, we invite you to join us and over a thousand other members of our community in signing thepetition3 . Reference Links"
crimson_2022_64,"I was warned, prior to embarking to the States, that Americans have poor English. While I appreciated such efforts to prime me for my experience in this country, I remained unfazed. For one, poor grammar, especially in a language that hasforced itselfupon the world, can only be expected. In fact, embracing “poor grammar” is a mode of anti-colonial resistance that I applaud. But, upon my arrival in the land of liberty, I was stumped to find that the dominating language rebelled, not just against conventions of grammar, but against norms of punctuation – with one clause in particular. It was in the cosmopolitan confines of Cambridge that I encountered the “Hi, how are you?” that ends with a period, instead of a question mark. It swiftly dawned on me that the city that I was to be courted by for the next four years of my life was one that did not know how to greet. Instead, I have been espoused by a city of sprinters, where we dash past others with such speed that people become mere meter-markers in the race to wherever we are off to next. In our ritual performance of city life — where eye contact is seemingly too intimate for the people we mumble “hi” to on our daily commute — I miss “Sawubona.” I miss more than the cadence of the vowels, cradled by the warmth of the “buh” and elevated by the whispering “w.” I miss more than being immersed in the language from which it evolved — a language that I cannot speak nor adequately understand, but a tongue that I cannot divorce from the place I call home. Where I come from, in the clicking vernacular of the people of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, “hello” is not “hello.” In isiZulu, we greet with “Sawubona” — “We see you.” When we greet, we witness and profess, breathing soul into the hollow chambers of “hello.” I miss Sawubona. I miss being seen. Remarkably, I have received some of the best greetings of my life in the short while that I have been in Massachusetts. However, most of these experiences have taken place at restaurants, cafes, and retail outlets, where smiles and “hellos” are attached to monetary values. It would be convenient for me to pawn off this flaw as characteristic American commercialism, and add it to my arsenal of reasons for criticizing the nation I now find myself a part of, a nation which I begrudge for all it possesses at theexpenseof places like my home. It would be easy to extend this observation and juxtapose it with the values of community that I have attached to South Africa — a country with personality, a nation with charisma. While I could belabor my disdain for the capitalist failings of the United States, the issue of greeting (or the lack thereof is not limited to America. In fact, my own dedication to the conventions of “Hi” and “How are you?” is a relatively recent development. I began my commitment to greeting people out of compliance with my high school’s regulations. These rules, which stipulated the need to greet, legitimized a culture of acknowledgment. But this legitimacy was selective. I recall these regulations being virtually italicized with our interactions with the staff of the school — the teachers and the management personnel. But not the people in between. Not the caretakers, of which the majority in South Africa arepoor; The people who traveled from far to maintain the equilibrium of well-trimmed suburbia for insupportable wages and even fewer thanks. This rule may have originated to enforce traditional dynamics of institutional respect. But the omission of some workers in institutionalized greeting culture had sinister collateral effects, even if they were accidental. By greeting along the socio-economic pecking order, we were pre-determining which people ought to be seen more than others. What began as a daunting chore, motivated by the fear of retribution, became a commitment to seeing — acknowledging — everybody: cashiers at the supermarket, security guards, the workers at my high school. And, here at Harvard, we should make an effort to greet the people in our entryway, strangers we sit with at Annenberg, and our classmates. But we must be most dedicated to greeting the people who are often glossed over as part of the red brick of this institution — HUDS staff, the workers milling about the yard during the day, the security guards who man the gates of the campus 24/7. We live in an age where the rights of these workers, both inour institutionand in thegreater community, are at odds with a society co-opted by the dynamics of profit and capital. Thus, choosing to acknowledge all people becomes a political decision. The exploitation of these workers is sustained by the narrative that they are disposable. But narratives of expendability become void when we begin to perceive all people as people. “Sawubona” then, becomes not just the act of witnessing: It asserts itself, more importantly, as the refusal to ignore. We greet to center the people who are eternally lodged in the peripheral – even if just for a moment. Colombe O. Eyono ’25, a Crimson Editorial Editor, lives in Wigglesworth Hall.

rice_thresher_2022_60,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/15/22 11:18pm Last week, the Texas A&M University President M. Katherine Banks gave The Battalion — A&M’s student newspaper — a 24-hour notice that they would have to stop printing despite being self-funded by advertisements, ahead of the paper being rolled into the university’s new journalism department. The administration made these calls without any consultation or even warning to the students or their faculty advisor, informing them that if they chose to remain a student organization, they would potentially lose their office and faculty advisor. Without any clear details on how this transition would work or what would happen to the staff, other than the requirement to transition the 129-year old publication to online only, the administration’s overuse of power here is a blatant attack on free press. By Friday afternoon, the president had walked the decision back to “allow” the paper to continue print editions through the remainder of the semester. However, this concession does nothing to address the core issue: university administration using their positions to lord their power over student media, undermining the editorial independence of college journalism. We are fortunate at the Thresher to have an administration that respects us as a newspaper, even when we criticize or question them, often on this page. But at a private institution like Rice, we technically havefewer baseline rightsthan student journalists at public institutions; a fact that allowed President Leebron to unilaterallysell KTRU’s station and tower in 2010without warning or explanation. Given that student journalists at state schools like A&M receive more coverage from free press laws than we do, the decision by Banks and the A&M administration is that much more egregious. With rising rates of misinformation, falling levels of trust in journalism and the United States being ranked as a“problematic” place for journalists in 2019, ensuring a free press is more important than ever. Banks, despite claiming that she supports freedom of the press and that the new journalism department is reflective of that, is acting in opposition to that by pushing The Battalion into a position that allows more administrative oversight of their content. As a board of student journalists, we empathize with what the staff at The Batt are going through. The Thresher stands with the staff at The Battalion. Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Savannah Kuchar, Ben Baker-Katz, Nayeli Shad, Talha Arif, Morgan Gage, Daniel Schrager and Brandon Chen. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

state_press_2022_14,"ASU s requirement of on-campus housing and meal plans for first year students is harmful to student success. For many students and parents, finances play a large role in choosing a college. Meal plans are required for on-campus, first-year students, and they are encouraged for upper-division students living in residence halls. For an in-state undergraduate student,base tuition, on-campus housing and mealscost about $25,108 a year without scholarships. If the meal plan was not forced on students, the University would be accessible to a greater number of them. The meal plan problem is only further escalated by how difficult it is for students to be excused from the requirement.Under the 2021-22 meal plan exemption form, students are required to obtain verification from their physician or spiritual advisor that they believe the student would be harmed if they participated in the required meal plan in order for ASU to consider their request for an exemption. Food and housing insecurity is a very common problem many people face. An October 2021 report from the Arizona Board of Regents student food and housing insecurity work groupfound that food and housing insecurity can impact higher levels of educational attainment, and students lives and education can be detrimentally impacted because of the burden of these insecurities. The same study included surveys indicating 25% to 50% of students are experiencing these challenges.It makes sense that ASU offers housing and dining plans to prevent these insecurities, but at what point do the financial detriments outweigh the benefits of having housing and food available in the first place? Arizona s median household incomeis $61,529, and ASU housing and dining can cost as much as 21% of that. Along with thecost of tuition, $12,393, ASU can cost on-campus residents up to roughly $27,000. With the median income at around $30,000after bills, this makes ASU unaffordable for most. The median household income in Arizona, $61,529 as of the 2020 Census, is not enough to pay for tuition, on-campus housing and meal plans, even at the residential rate of about $25,108. Withfood and housing insecurityaffecting 39% and 46% of students nationwide respectively according to theHope Center for College, Community, and Justice, it is clear that ASU rates do not cater to the majority of residents. ASU should offer scholarships that can be applied directly to these living expenses, especially considering theUniversity sclaims that living at ASU promotes creative connections and innovation ... designed to set you up for success. Aramark, the company contracted with the University to supply dining halls, has been a concern among ASU students for a while as the companysupports a history of unethical concerns. This brings up another problem regarding the meal plan — it forces on-campus students to pay unethical companies that they don t want to support. So, why is it that this company is still on campus, and furthermore, why is it mandatory for many on-campus students at unreasonable prices? I chose to get out the meal plan first semester of freshman year … It was a lot cheaper to walk and get my groceries instead and also have better options, said Sarah Taut, a junior studying biochemistry. (The meal exemption wasn’t too hard, … but I ve heard they’ve given other people a difficult time in the same situation as me. Personally, it took me a month of continuously contacting housing and dining services in order to get a response to my exemption. I stated my case multiple times, but my reasoning being that the food upset my stomach was not enough for the University to excuse me from the requirement. Since being excused from the meal plan, Taut and I both have seen improvements in our health and finances. My budget probably improved most (and getting out of a meal plan would have improved (health concerns anyways since I didn’t have a good reaction to the food when I did eat it, Taut said. Although it is unclear whether ASU s dining hall food is unhealthy, it iscommonly knownthat students tend to make unhealthy eating choices in college due to a lack of healthy options. It seems that the University’s pride in on-campus living is unreasonable for most, which prohibits the equal opportunity of education for on- and off-campus students. If ASU truly valued on-campus living as much as it says, then it would make housing affordable and offer financial aid in this aspect. It is more affordable to buy and cook your own food as opposed to the pure convenience of dining halls. For perspective, theaverage college studentin Arizona spends around $207 per month on groceries. With meal plans lasting around four months, and thetraditional planpriced at $2,840 per semester, students pay around $710 per month. This is more than three times the average amount of groceries. Overall, ASU needs to make housing and dining options more affordable by either subsidizing costs through scholarships or getting rid of the forced meal plan altogether.

crimson_2022_161,"Despite the limitations of my College curriculum and concentration requirements, last semester, I managed to make time in my schedule to take Professor Kirsten A. Weld’s expansive seminar on the history of modern Mexico. We traveled back to Mexico’s colonial period, then to its independence and the tumultuous aftermath that paved the way for the Revolution in the 20th century, ending in modern-day border politics and drug organizations. It was a rude awakening. Mexico had always been a beautiful paradise to me, with its ancient sun and mighty temples, whose watching skies led the monarchs to their autumnal home. I was told that I descended from those who built floating cities and guided the dead. We were chosen by gods. We found the eagle perched on the cactus devouring a snake. We communicated with the celestial bodies. But the modern truth of Mexico is one of disgrace, displacement, and dismemberment. The number of women dead at the hands of male violence has risen to epidemic levels. Femicide plagues Mexico. Every day in 2020, at least 10 women were murdered — around a third of them for their gender. The femicides only pile up higher as the years pass: From 427 reported victims in 2015, to 940 in 2020, to 1,004 in 2021, femicide has seen a 135 percent increase, with nearly one in five female homicides occurring in the home. These numbers are haunting; yet, these rates are most likely underreported, given the inaction of the Mexican government, which has failed to search for at least 20,000 women who are still missing. Dehumanized in comparison to men, women are subject to significant violence at home. Men beat, rape, and murder their wives, daughters, sisters, mothers, and neighbors. This displacement of women’s humanity is not a uniquely Mexican invention; it is inherited from colonization by the Spanish with their masculine modes of domination. Slaughtered and tortured, Indigenous communities were dominated violently. In order to leverage any small amount of power under subjugation, Mexican men adopted the patriarchal violence that rendered women second — perpetrating European modes of domination toward their own people. Such aggression is continuously encouraged at psychological, physical, and cultural levels against women, dismembering not only their bodies but also their selves. Even in communities where women do not fear physical harm, they are often denied the agency of their personhood. In many states in Mexico, women are legally or culturally barred from abortion and education. The gender wage gap grows significantly. Even when women manage to enter the workforce despite the obstacles, many soon come to find themselves punished for pursuing motherhood. Indigenous women receive the brunt of this gendered violence, facing domination in language, land, and labor. The personhood of women is continuously made a shadow in the colossus of the man. The lore of La Virgen, La Malinche, and La Llorona further recognizes the cultural echoes of violence against women. A woman: immaculate, daughter of Eve, mother of Jesus, whose image was impressed upon the cloak of then-peasant Saint Juan Diego as proof of her most holy existence. A woman: traitor, lover of the white man, mother of the Mexican, whose back faced her sorrowful brethren as she forcefully sought mountains of gold with the steel-plated man. A woman: wailer, ghost of vengeance, mother of dead children, whose own children she drowned after her white lover abandoned her. The Mexican woman is expected to be pure like La Virgen, yet a passive subject of violence like La Malinche, all while suffering in perpetuity like La Llorona. Chingada, “fucked” in Spanish. Chingar, “fuck” in Spanish. Chingón, “macho man” in Spanish. The writing is on the wall about the behavior of men towards women: It is an act of violence from men that turns into an act of violation for women. This is not an indictment of Mexican men. They, too, have suffered beneath the violent colonial modes of domination. It is a call for help, an echo of the work being accomplished in Mexico today by women and other organizers alike. While women are being killed and the world watches, mothers and families are mobilizing in their name to unite the body and self once more, to return humanity to women and demand the end of violence against them. Violence is not unknown to women in the United States of America. But it would be historically inaccurate to claim that white women are subject to the same violence that non-white women are, today and in the past. When I look around at the women at Harvard, I see mostly white. They are strangers to the violence happening in Mexico — the violence happening to women like them, but not like them. I ask myself why my sisters are not worthy of their mercy. I write this piece standing in front of a grave of murdered Mexican women, whose deaths bear heavy on my hesitating soul. I dedicate this Hispanic Heritage Month to these women, documenting their humanity to the world with the words of this piece. End all violence against women, in Mexico and everywhere else. My mothers, sisters, daughters, and neighbors: Rest in Mercy. Brian Baltazar Pimentel ’23, a Crimson Editorial editor, is an English concentrator in Eliot House. This piece is part of a focus on Hispanic authors and experiences for Hispanic Heritage Month."
thetech_mit_2022_41,"I write today to share some personal reflections and concerns about the way our community is currently interacting. I have had the honor of serving graduate students and the broader MIT community for nearly 25 years. I have often found my experiences deeply rewarding, and I have enormous respect and love for graduate students and the broader MIT community. As I have said before, our grad students are the spirit and the energy of MIT, the mind, hand, and heart. They have been my thought partners, helping to create a better Institute for all its people, on initiatives such as the Graduate Community Fellows program and the annual Path of Professorship workshop. I count former grad students as my chosen family. They are my reason for being at MIT. Similarly, it has been my great pleasure to work with faculty members to mitigate student crises, to provide individual funding for those in need, to think through intricate issues of policy, and to build programs that increase diversity and improve the climate at MIT. My staff colleagues have been my staunchest teammates, eternally ready to advance MIT’s goals for the good of the community with vision, heart, and dedication. We students, faculty, and staff have done outstanding work together. Through these years of working with the MIT community, you can well imagine that there were some fundamental disagreements between various parties on any number of topics. Participants have disagreed on exactly what change was needed, whether it was needed at all, and how fast we should change. Opinions diverged widely about the school of thought on which we should base our decisions and about logistical details large and small. But it is only in recent times that I have become deeply troubled by thewaywe disagree. There has been a marked decline in the civility of our discourse. I do not write to point fingers; I will refrain from sharing names or specific events. It is also important to point out that this is broader than any single issue — I am not just talking about any decision by the administration, or conversations around masking, or staffing issues, or unionization. With that being said, I have been privy to communications that have been disrespectful in the extreme. I have seen combative emails and vulgar language. I have heard reports of individuals crowding others in dining areas or testing drop-off locations in order to force them to listen. Members of our community have described “constant harassment” on a particular issue. I sometimes witness accusations instead of active listening. These days, the dissatisfaction with our exchanges seems to be pervasive. Members of our community — from every segment — are feeling wounded. You are weary. You feel unheard and dismissed. You are frustrated. I understand. Over the course of my career in higher education, I remember times when my own voice was made small, or ignored altogether. I have fought long and hard only to have to keep fighting over andoverfor vital resources or for injustices to be acknowledged and addressed or made right. I know what it is to feel devalued. It can get to a point where quelling the anger, the weariness, becomes a gargantuan effort. I have been there too. But before you let your feelings tumble out, have a care. Are you about to yell? Curse? Deliver insults? Treat someone with hostility? Even if you think the vitriol is deserved, pause for just a moment. Consider what you’re trying to achieve. Consider howyouwant to be treated and heard. This month, theMIT Values Statementwas finalized, which synthesized input from dozens of meetings with over 600 students, faculty, staff, and alumni. It reads, in part: We know that attending to our own and each other’s wellbeing in mind, body, and spirit is essential. We believe that decency, kindness, respect, and compassion for each other as human beings are a sign of strength. We have all chosen to be part of the MIT community. It is hugely complex and diverse. It is imperfect. It will, in fact, never be perfect. But imperfection has never been our cue to concede defeat. If this values statement speaks to you, I call upon you now to do your part to make it real. Of course, we will struggle and disagree. Sometimes change feels too slow for no apparent reason. Other times, it must be slow in order for us to get buy-in and investment from key stakeholders so we can successfully achieve our goal. A slower pace doesn’t necessarily mean that others don’t care. Do you feel the need to apply pressure? Understandable. Just remember that one can press and advocate vigorously without becoming adversarial. Brutal and demeaning words will not get us closer to resolution. Give each other grace and space. Allow your heart to call to the common humanity that unites us. Ask questions instead of presuming. In our studies, we are trained to present compelling arguments and to use data that supports our thesis. But don’t sacrifice your integrity. Be accurate in referencing data or the views of others. Let’s all choose actions that affirm our best vision of ourselves and our community. Let us treat others as we expect and desire to be treated. No matter where we stand today, or how our vital conversations proceed, we will remain members of the same community. We will continue to disagree. We will continue to strive for progress despite imperfection. Each of us will bring something to the table. Each of us can make a difference. Let’s make space to struggle forward together, without deepening the wounds we all carry.Blanche Staton is Senior Associate Dean and Director of theOffice of Graduate Educationat MIT."
crimson_2022_72,"With the start of a new year comes New Year’s resolutions — you know, those promises we make to ourselves on the first day of every year that we always intend to keep but never actually do. So, with a brand new semester underway, I’ve made a resolution that I do in fact plan to uphold: to stop walking to class so quickly and look up every once in a while. Last semester, I scheduled my walks to class down to the very last second. I knew exactly what time I had to leave my room to get to class on time. I practiced getting the 12-minute walk from my dorm to the Science Center down to eight minutes. I saw no flaws in my logic — after all, I was simply being more efficient, maximizing my productivity and minimizing time spent wandering around campus. And, yet, while I did in fact get to class on time (for the most part , I failed at something perhaps even more important: being present. For as long as I can remember, college has been a dream of mine. It was this faraway fantasy I spent every day working towards. I was eager to head off to college — a place that would allow me to explore economics, government, and social theory in my academic life and music, journalism, and public service in my extracurricular life – and carve my own path. But, once I got here? Well, more often than not, I spent my days constantly in a rush: running from one meeting to the next, recalculating the most optimal travel routes, too busy looking down at the time on my phone screen to look up and take in the fact that the dream I once romanticized had turned into my now very rushed reality. In our own ways, we are all rushing somewhere — especially at Harvard. With our student body being an aggregation of overachievers, it’s been far too easy to normalize and glorify “grind culture.” We have to be doing something at all times, every second of every day. And if your Google Calendar isn’t booked and busy on a random Thursday afternoon, or if you don’t spend every single minute of your precious time drowning in productivity, you convince yourself that you’re falling behind your peers, that you should be ashamed. Harvard has a serious problem with work — and overwork — culture. But the largest problem of all? There just isn’t enough time to do it all. With such busy schedules and such little time, the last thing we all care about is the travel time that takes us from one thing to the next. When recapping our days, we typically don’t rave about the thrilling 15-minute walk we took between classes. That time often gets lost. Goes from a fleeting moment to a forgotten memory. But just because we’re always looking towards the shiny new future doesn’t mean we should be speeding through our present. At the end of this semester, I’ll be halfway done with my time as an undergraduate. And with days flying by almost as fast as I can walk to class, I’ve realized that I should probably be more appreciative of this time while I still have it. That I should stop getting so caught up in my destination and, instead, step back and take a moment to appreciate the daily path I take to get there. From the bitter sting of the harsh Boston winds hitting my cheeks to the sweet aroma that wafts in the air around Tatte, it’s these little things about my environment — these familiar scents, feelings, and sounds — that make my daily path to class so special. And it’s more than time that I savor these moments before they are no longer a part of my present but my past. So, this semester, I want to do things differently. I want to slow down my daily walks to class and take a look around. I want to become more appreciative of the things, people, and places that surround me. I want to savor this place that I have called home for a year and will continue to call home for the next two years. I want to start taking notice of the little things that life has to offer. The ones that often go unnoticed when we don’t stop to take a look around us. Nicole B. Alexander ’24, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Kirkland House.

He was a professor at the University of the Virgin Islands and California Lutheran University for a decade prior to a 30-year career as a Principal Biologist and Associate Vice President with AECOM. Since retiring in 2017, he has focused on climate activism.

Over the years these companies have provided considerable financial support to different programs at Stanford, which has been valuable to the school, faculty members and students. For that support, the companies have gained access to extremely talented research scientists and engineers and first chance at hiring Stanford’s top students. By being associated with Stanford’s top-flight research programs, these companies have also received good publicity and burnished their reputation for innovation. All these benefits have come at a very cost-effective price to them. Unfortunately, the fossil fuel industry has awell-documented historyof half-truths, deception and misinformation — all with the intent of slowing action on addressing the causes of and effects from global warming. These actions have been both direct by the companies and indirect through industry organizations. As clarity on the causes and effects of global warming has increased, the fossil fuel companies’ tactics have evolved from denying climate change was occurring to delaying action to deal with it. They are quiteexperienced in greenwashing, so even now, they tout programs for carbon capture and storage, clean biofuels, low- or no-carbon synthetic fuels and other questionable (and thus far uneconomic programs. At the same time, they are investing onlypennies on the dollaron so-called green energy projects compared to their investment in extracting, refining and selling petroleum and natural gas. Stanford Alumni for Climate Actionis a group of climate activist alumni who support the current effort to have the School of Sustainability reject money from fossil fuel companies. We applaud Stanford’s leadership in addressing climate change as demonstrated by the opening of the new School. However, we are concerned about the negative influence that these companies can have in solving the extremely urgent crises resulting from climate change. We will continue to monitor the evolution of the new School and will reflect on how best to support the School of Sustainability in particular and the University in general based on what meaningful actions are taken by the administration in its association with fossil fuel companies.

thetech_mit_2022_6,"Before coming to MIT, I served in the U.S. Army as an infantry soldier. Most of my time in service was spent deployed in Eastern Europe, conducting NATO ally reassurance missions and counter-Russian aggression operations after the annexation of Crimea. Since being accepted to the MIT AeroAstro program in 2019, however, MIT has failed to correctly certify my Veterans Affairs (VA educational benefits. MIT was noncompliant with federal regulations and unresponsive to my calls to action. These educational benefits are guaranteed in the Post-9/11 GI bill, which provides tuition and housing allowances to veterans who honorably served the country. These benefits enable veterans to gain skills that will help them transition to civilian life through educational and economic support. These benefits have allowed me to begin a new career which is useful and exciting. I joined the MIT Student Veterans Association (SVA to advocate for the improvement of this situation for all MIT veterans. Since August 2020, the SVA has highlighted the lack of support for and neglect of the veteran community here at MIT. This has included the lack of a Veteran Support Office, access to coordinated VA healthcare, and data on the identity and number of veterans we have on campus. Even with strong support from the Institute Community and Equity Office and faculty like Professor Amy Glasmeier, the issues brought forth by the SVA are largely ignored or marginalized. The problem was left to fester for over two years, and in Fall 2021, reportedly at least 20 student veterans did not receive their VA benefits worth approximately $3 million in tuition, nor did we receive our $3,000 per month stipend. I personally lacked the funds to pay bills and living expenses, which required me to use emergency savings. I spent countless hours having to coordinate and navigate VA offices, VA policies, Massachusetts Department of Higher Education staff, and federal regulations. This took significant time and attention away from my research. Other veterans with families who relied on the stipend for income faced further financial hardships as they had dependents to support. MIT’s administration did not respond to questions or provide support or assistance for months. It wasn’t until the story was covered bymilitary.comthat MIT’s administration began to respond in an attempt to deflect the negative press and poor optics. MIT frequently left even the president and other leaders of the SVA out of conversations, meetings, and planning sessions regarding veterans issues. I joined the MIT Graduate Student Union because without a union,graduate students will continue to be seen as a resource to be managed rather than what we truly are — workers and partners in research who deserve a seat at the table.It is clear to me after working with the highest levels of MIT’s administration that graduate students still lack legitimate power and a voice in the policies and decisions that affect us. Despite the administration’s claims, the existing avenues accessible by student groups like the SVA,Graduate Student Council, orBlack Graduate Student Associationdo not have sufficient power to affect change on behalf of graduate student-workers. As theleaders of these organizations will attest, student groups have the power to make suggestions for improvement, but without the accountability our union would provide, MIT often delays acting on or completely dismisses student feedback. By forming a union, graduate student-workers at MIT can ensure that our problems are taken seriously by MIT administration and that our rights are protected by a legally enforceable contract. MIT is failing to meet the federal expectations they agreed to. Having the VA benefits that veterans are entitled to at MIT would make the institution more accessible for all veterans. I would be spending less time worried about my finances and more time focused on my coursework and research. Join me bysigning your union cardtoday and voting yes on forming a union."
stanforddaily_2022_129,"Dear members of the Stanford community, The emergence of pivotal social movements such as Abolish Greek in the summer of 2020 sparked key conversations about genuine allyship, equity and safety and inspired us to critically evaluate our own role and complicity in the Greek system as ex-members of a sorority. It is with a mixture of sadness, relief, and pride that we and the majority of the active former members of the Omicron Chapter of Sigma Psi Zeta (SYZ , a multicultural and Asian-rooted sorority, decided to disaffiliate from SYZ and launch the Asian Women’s Alliance (AWA . After many discussions, we came to the conclusion that though the space SYZ created for Asian women was valuable for many, its position within the Greek system prevented it from practicing true inclusiveness, a principle that we hold most dear. Instead, we have established AWA, a University-funded voluntary student organization, which better represents our dedication to forging bonds between women of color and eradicating systems of oppression. We value the foresight that the founding mothers of SYZ demonstrated in 2003 in carving out a space for Asian women to connect, enriching the Stanford community’s awareness of nuanced Asian and Asian-American identities. Past and current members of SYZ were deeply dedicated to one another and continue to be inspired by the depth of each other’s intelligence, empathy, and passion for giving back to our communities. And yet, we would be remiss not to acknowledge the ways in which we at the Sigma Psi Zeta Sorority relied on harmful practices that characterize much of Greek life. We were not immune to imposing secrecy on members in regards to the specifics of pledging and other rituals, using fees punitively, judging prospective members by their attire or perceived social capital, or restricting membership to give off the impression of exclusivity. A common occurrence during recruitment was coaching current members to skirt questions about the commitment the sorority entails so that rushees would have to join the sorority before fully understanding what they were signing onto. We believe this practice violates the principles of informed consent and blurs the lines between encouragement and coercion. Reflecting upon the consequences of being in SYZ allowed us to realize that our precious community of Asian women was housed in the wrong vessel. Two of the very few spaces dedicated specifically to Asian women on Stanford campus were sororities. As a result, they remained shrouded in secrecy and barred by hundreds of dollars in quarterly fees. Ultimately, we decided the right path forward was to transplant our community and mission and to leave Greek life behind. Throughout our disaffiliation process, we have heard criticisms that we would like to take time to address here. First, the argument stands that Greek life can only be changed from within. To counter this claim, it is critical to recognize that fees and secrecy pledges are the lifeblood of Greek organizations. Organizations that rely on these things cannot be fully equitable or progressive, because embodying any of those traits requires transparency, and transparency threatens the very business model that Greek life depends on. Furthermore, both informal expectations of loyalty to one’s fraternity or sorority and official secrecy pledges nearly always work to protect the perpetrator in instances of hazing, sexual assault, racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and other sources of harm. The preservation of white supremacy is baked into the very DNA of Greek life. And at the end of the day, we realized that we could not meaningfully reform a white supremacist institution. Second, people have suggested that Greek life forges bonds like no other. However, we would argue that it was the people who joined SYZ who created those bonds, rather than the Greek system that the organization belonged to. Moreover, if organizations are relying on exclusionary and pressure-inducing practices such as rush and pledge to forge such bonds, we question the validity of that approach. In addition, the internal bonds between fraternity and sorority members are strengthened when their organization is housed — a privilege given to these students simply for being selected to join an exclusive social club. We call for the University to unhouse all the Interfraternity Council (IFC and Inter-Sorority Council (ISC Greek organizations that are currently housed on the Row and enjoy exclusive privileges that are available to no other student organizations, such as private chefs, guaranteed housing by bypassing the traditional draw process, designated spaces to host mixers, and more. The commitment that the University has made to continue Greek housing further demonstrates that Stanford still upholds such oppressive systems. Greek organizations, if they continue to operate, should be treated like any other student organization — bound by the same policies, offered the same opportunities. Through this process, the genuine communities bonded by shared values and interests will survive and thrive. By contrast, organizations bonded only by privilege and exclusivity will fail — and perhaps such organizations ought never to have existed in the first place. We understand that many who join Greek life do so seeking community, and call on all IFC and ISC members and Potential New Members (PNMs to disaffiliate and to instead join or form organizations that will be subject to the same rules as every other student organization on campus. Asian and Asian-American women in the U.S. have the peculiar experience of being caught between being invisible and enduring both racist and sexist harassment. The identity of the Asian woman is one that is objectified, made invisible, and downplayed in America’s extensive history of anti-Asian violence, imperialism, and policymaking. We will broach these painful subjects and more in the Asian Women’s Alliance. But at the same time, we will instill pride and joy in our diverse cultures, educate ourselves and others about how the Asian-American community is far from homogeneous, and take steps to combat the racism and sexism that have harmed Asian-American women for centuries. While AWA is meant to provide a space of joy, friendship, and mentorship, and foster ethnic pride and awareness for Asian women, we welcome and encourage allies of all identities to join our community to learn about the complexities of the Asian and Asian-American experience. Greek life may have brought us together, but we are evolving beyond it and we hope you’ll join us. — Elizabeth “Betsy” Kim, Kavita Selva, Liza Hafner, Minh Nguyen The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.

thetech_mit_2022_57,"We are writing as interested faculty, not at the request of the MIT administration. The possibility of MIT graduate students forming a workers’ union will be determined by an upcoming vote April 4–5. We fully support the right of graduate students to decide whether or not to unionize. At issue is the question of whether our students and our Institute would be better served by a relationship that positions students as “workers” in an industry-like organization or as academic partners and rising colleagues who, in the course of their educational program, contribute to our shared teaching and research missions. We urge our community to consider this question openly, broadly, and with the utmost care. In our view, unionization would represent a fundamental change in the academic partnerships between faculty and graduate students and could put at risk the critically important relationship between graduate student mentee and faculty mentor, potentially jeopardizing the leadership roles that our students and faculty hold in advancing the future of science, technology, and scholarship. The relationship between workers and management in a unionized environment, as laid out under the National Labor Relations Act, reflects organizational structures drawn from the history of labor relationships in industry. Such a structure would position graduate education quite differently from its historic role in academia. By its nature, a unionized environment emphasizes the common experiences of workers over their individuality; it reduces flexibility in favor of a highly structured relationship between manager and workers. We believe that such industry-framed relationships are ill-suited to the nature of and rapidly evolving opportunities in graduate education, where individuality and flexibility are necessary to foster a dynamic trajectory for graduate students as they move from undergraduate degree holders to full participants in discovery and teaching. Interposing a bureaucratic and potentially oppositional relationship of “workers and management” could undermine the success of this critically important step in career evolution. We welcome our graduate students into our programs as partners and colleagues in the pursuit and transmission of knowledge, and we feel that the best way to do so is with an unwavering commitment to the development of policies, programs, and a culture that will support collaborative, flexible, and, above all, collegial interactions. We believe, and many have articulated, that graduate students choose to come to MIT because of the departmental and faculty advisors who will work with them individually, as caring mentors, to develop foundational knowledge and to identify topics at the forefront of their field for a thesis. In many cases, students do their thesis work by becoming research assistants (RAs , and they receive stipends supported by grants from federal, nonprofit, or for-profit organizations. For graduate students, the primary value of an RAship comes from the training process and how it prepares them for a lifetime of contribution to society. The team of mentor and student, interacting together in a partnership and as collaborators, is critical for this training process to be effective. In preparing graduate students for a professional career, MIT also introduces them to the education of others, often by having students serve as teaching assistants (TAs . In this role, again, graduate students serving as TAs are mentored by the MIT faculty and often receive specialized training that creates a positive experience for both the TAs and their students. MIT graduate programs integrate research, communication, and disciplinary training, and no matter what profession graduate students ultimately pursue, the training they receive in these areas greatly helps them further their careers. MIT’s graduate students do different kinds of research and teaching depending on their disciplines and subdisciplines. We afford autonomy to the faculty of each graduate program, within generally accepted parameters, to allow them to design programs that address evolving critical topics and rapid breakthroughs in research. Innovation at speed is one of our greatest assets, and that speed requires flexibility and interdisciplinary variation. Unionization, with its externally imposed and uniform requirements, risks hampering the development of individual graduate students; it might also impede our ability as a university to adapt to new opportunities and challenges. Excellent, internationally recognized graduate programs and support for our students are central to our mission; they are not optional accessories. Graduate students represent the future of our disciplines — and of MIT itself. We compete to bring to our campus the world’s best students and faculty; there are no contributors more important to our mission and ambition. As the training ground for tomorrow’s leaders, graduate education plays a particularly critical role in the continuous reinvention of our disciplines and our universities, which means that the question now under consideration is of the utmost importance. Is unionization in the best interests of our graduate students and their education? Because of the risks of constraining the individuality, flexibility, and collaborative partnerships of student-faculty relationships that enable us to be leaders in research, science, and education, we believe that unionization is not in the best interests of our graduate students and their training. We believe that those relationships, and the leadership roles of our students and MIT, should not be placed in jeopardy unless there is overwhelming evidence that it is necessary. Phillip A. SharpInstitute Professor and Professor of Biology Alan D. GrossmanProfessor and Head, Department of Biology"
state_press_2022_0,"Conversation surrounds the 1619 Project and whether or not history curriculums in Arizona will look the same after the November election. ASU requires a history class for all undergraduates, so students can develop useful knowledge of the past to shape the present and future. Last month, President of theAmerican Historical AssociationJames Sweet received considerable backlash for warning against the opposite – shaping the past with knowledge of the present. “Too many Americans have become accustomed to the idea of history as an evidentiary grab bag to articulate their political positions,”he said, while considering the historical accuracy of the1619 Projectby the New York Times. The initiative, which began as a journalistic reframing of American history through the lens of slavery, was later turned into a high school curriculum in partnership with the Pulitzer Center. He apologized. He should not have. When experts are afraid to say what they know is true, we re left hearing the loudest voices in the room, whether they re correct or not. We should be critical of what we’re being told and by whom and should consider what they may have to gain. In January 2021, the American Historical Association did not apologize when theycondemnedformer President Donald Trump’s1776 Commission, claiming their report called for a form of government indoctrination of American students and was full of “falsehoods, inaccuracies, omissions, and misleading statements. It additionally failed to mention Indigenous communities and excluded women and enslaved people. As, the AHA implies, the Founding Fathers would have intended. That commission was chaired by Larry P. Arnn, president of Hillsdale College, the source for theHillsdale 1776curriculum which Kari Lake, Republican candidate for Arizona governor, intends to align with Arizona state curriculum standards. The governor indicating and dictating to school districts which curriculum they use would be really unprecedented,” said David Garcia, associate professor at the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College. “And I would imagine, as a matter of principle, both parties should be opposed to that. Garcia was also the former Democratic nominee for governor of Arizona, having lost to Doug Ducey in 2018. As a strong advocate for public schools, he ran on education. As a representative for the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, however, he seemed ambivalent about how the gubernatorial election may affect Arizona schools, including ASU. He said the best school systems in the world teach the ability to learn how to learn, and that curriculum is less important than ensuring students are competent. He also shrugged off any concern that a governor would interfere with ASU curriculum. “What would need to happen for the governor to censor what I write tomorrow?” Garcia said. “The role of Arizona State from an economic and development perspective would outweigh, in my opinion, what would be a small-minded fight about the content of any one particular class.” That ambivalence, like Sweet’s apology, is troubling. According to theAmerican Association of Colleges and Universities, seven states have already imposed restrictions on teaching at the college and university level, and 28 states have introduced bills with the same intent. Censorship can also happen without official policy. Educators can be gaslit or intimidated– tactics used by many of the people Lake s rhetoric is meant to energize. Until the language was updated this week, Lake s official campaign website promoted the Hillsdale 1776 curriculum, to “end the progressive indoctrination” of the 1619 Project curriculum, and that “Arizona schools should not be used as factories to churn out deliberately mis-educated progressive activists.” AZ Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake would like to see the state adopt the Hillsdale College-developed 1776 curriculum, inspired by what former President Trump called a patriotic education. A charter school in the state already teaches it.https: t.co/6s1xLKIQh9 Might she include ASU among those schools? Her campaign did not respond to inquiry. Kassidy Wheeler, senior majoring in political science and justice studies and social chair forASU Young Democrats, believes promoting any partisan curriculum is dangerous. “I don’t necessarily think any politics should be involved in school, leftist democratic politics included,” Wheeler said. Wheeler, who attended Arizona public schools, said it’s more important to introduce comparative ideas than to limit studies to a dominant culture’s perspective. “I never learned about the treatment of Indigenous Americans when it came to the poisoning of their water supplies and taking their land, Wheeler said. As a student in Arizona, I didn’t learn about that until I got to college. Isaac Humrich, sophomore political science major and president of College Republicans at ASU, is also a product of Arizona public schools. He is a conservative and has supported Republican candidates for years. While he supports Lake’s bid for governor, he has less of a problem with schools adopting the 1619 project curriculum. “It allows us to have conversations,” Humrich said. “And then, hopefully, those conversations allow us to get maybe not to the truth of the matter, but closer to the truth of the matter.” Lake has been justifiably critical of Katie Hobbs, her Democratic opponent, fordodging a debatemeant to do just that. It distracts from substantive issues, like Lake’s support of a politically slanted curriculum and what that could mean for Arizona. The governor appoints 10 of the 11 members of the Board of Education. The Republican candidate for the only elected seat, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, is Tom Horne. His official campaign website is more incite-full than insightful. While he promises to increase student performance in reading and math, he somehow manages to fail at both. For example, on Aug. 15, he incorrectly cited theWashington Post, saying “(t he number of unarmed people shot by police per year is about 17. In fact, their reporting shows 456 unarmed people have been shot andkilledby police since 2015. That’s over 65 people per year. Is this “mis-education”? We must question sources of information as well as their motives, and we must call out false or misleading information. This extreme political rhetoric is a direct threat to educational institutions. When experts and academic leaders choose apologies and ambivalence over conviction, it is as if they aren’t showing up to the debate.

crimson_2022_25,"Debates over the admissions policies of Harvard and other elite universities are all the rage, particularly as the Supreme Court is hearing arguments today in a case that will likely spell the doom of race-conscious affirmative action. Many at Harvard havereactedwithopprobriumto this case’s hearing and to the potential decision, arguing that Harvard’s current admissions regime is necessary to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. But the hot, ongoing debates over the substance of Harvard’s admissions policies — whetherraceorsocioeconomic statusshould be taken into account, whether or notlegacy applicantsdeserve a leg up — are not truly questions of inclusion. Advocates for affirmative action are not attempting to make Harvard broadly inclusionary — a tall order for an institution that is, by its very nature, highly exclusive, most recentlyacceptingfewer than one in 25 applicants. Instead, they wish to alter the distribution of an extraordinarily scarce good: a spot at Harvard. Those on both sides of the debate take this scarcity as a given, moving not to accept more applicants, but instead to engineer precisely which lucky few may access a Harvard education with all its lifelong benefits. We don’t have to take scarcity as a given. Instead of locking horns over which group of students deserves preference in admissions, we can give up the zero-sum game entirely. We can let more brilliant young people walk through Harvard’s hallowed gates. We can make Harvard abundant. It’s time to expand Harvard’s undergraduate enrollment. The unchallengeable assumption that Harvard only has so many spots to hand out limits what Harvard can achieve as an institution. Harvard’s problem with equity and inclusion in the admissions process is not that Harvard admits the wrong set of students — too privileged, too wealthy, too white — but that it admits too few. Harvard promises from the very beginning a “transformative college experience.” And, at least in the economic sense, it succeeds beyond its wildest dreams. Underprivileged students who attend top universities like Harvard experience extraordinaryupward mobility, reaching nearly thesame levelof income as their wealthy peers. One admissions decision — a “yes” or “no” from Harvard or another top school on the admissions portal screen — might make a large difference in lifetime earnings for a significant group of hopeful teens. However, it is impossible for Harvard to be this engine of opportunity, mobility, equity, and inclusivity when its admissions numbers haveremainedat similar levels for the past 20 years, even as application numbers have surged. Expanding enrollment will spread the fruits of a Harvard education far and wide, rather than confining it to a worthy elect. Still, this proposal would come with some necessary sacrifices. It would require us to let go of the American tendency to see exclusivity as the stamp of prestige and scarcity as the stamp of value, defining our “elite” universities as necessarily small and highly selective. There is no reason they must be: Canada’s top-ranked institution of higher education, the University of Toronto, enrolls over 70,000 undergraduates. Harvard enrolls about 7,000, one-tenth of that number. There is no tradeoff between the quantity of students and the quality of education, especially withno shortageof potential faculty to hire. A larger community is not a lesser community. It is a more abundant community. What we might lose in the allure of prestige-by-exclusivity is made up for tenfold by the fundamental character of the people and the institution. As Harvard grapples with the scourge of elitism — from competitive club comp processes to a social scene dominated by exclusive final clubs — perhaps a paradigm shift in what creates a valuable college experience is necessary. We can start to define Harvard’s excellence by true excellence of outcome, not simply the artificial excellence implied by exclusivity. As long as we assume that the aggregate amount of opportunity Harvard can provide is limited to its current level of enrollment, Harvard will never be the force for equity that it tells us it wants to be — and that it easily can become. Open the gates. There is so much more we can do. Sam E. Meacham ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Pforzheimer House."

With no presidential election at stake in 2022, do this year’s midterm elections even matter that much? I wasn’t sure until I saw the completelist of offices up for election in Texasthis November. Most notably, the midterm election will determine the next Texas Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, both chambers of the Texas Legislature and all 38 U.S. Representatives. The race for Governorwill be particularly contentious: it pits Republican incumbentGreg Abbottagainst former U.S. House member DemocratBeto O’Rourke. Their platforms and campaign promises clash on nearly every issue, from climate change to marijuana legalization. To skeptics who argue that all politicians are essentially carbon copies of each other, this is certainly not the case in the Texas gubernatorial race. Down-ballot races will be just as consequential. Thevolatile political backdropin which these midterms are being held will allow Texas to shift significantly towards the political left or right over the next two years. In the wake of the mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas that left 21 dead, gun control and police presence in schools will be a focal point. Additionally, abortion rights hang in jeopardy in Texas due to theabortion banthat took effect after the Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wadein June. Another pressing issue for Texas voters is the state’s power grid. Various extreme weather events haveexposedits flaws, but this November’s candidates back widely differing solutions. Although these issues may seem abstract or distant, they’re bound to impact the Rice community intimately. Rice is not insulated from legislation governing Texas or the United States. As a concrete example, on-campus students were asked in a Sept. 8 email from Rice Facilities Engineering & Planning to reduce their daily energy use due to vulnerabilities in Texas’ power grid. More generally, the chances that members of the Rice community will need to seek reproductive health services or will know someone affected by gun violence are high. Our collective quality of life is undeniably dependent on the future of the climate. To live in a democracy is to be implicated in the wellbeing of the collective — and as such, it’s our responsibility to be civically engaged. If you’re registered to vote in a state other than Texas, your ballot will likely feature candidates with starkly contrasting views on inflation, Russia’s war on Ukraine, reproductive rights and other issues. Further, many of your home jurisdiction’s local policies may hang in the balance too. Since voting by mail requires you to send in your ballot early, it’s advisable to look into your state’s procedure as soon as you can. If you’re convinced that this year’s midterm elections matter immensely, it’s time to make a voting plan. The deadline to register to vote in Harris County isOct. 11. All you need to do is fill out the applicationonlineor in print from your College Coordinator’s office and mail it in. It takes less than ten minutes – but please don’t leave it until the last day. You’ve got options for when to cast your vote: Early Voting is open from Oct. 24 to Nov. 4, with thenearest polling locationin the Medical Center at 6550 Bertner Ave. On Election Day, which is Nov. 8 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., you’ll need to look no further than the Cohen House right here on campus to cast your ballot. Pick a time and slot it in your calendar so it doesn’t slip through the cracks. Make sure to bring avalid IDand check out yoursample ballotbeforehand. The 2022 midterm elections are too consequential to be left up to everyone else. If you needed a sign not to skip the midterm elections, this is it. Happy voting! April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2022_3,"“The whole world is moving / And I’m standing still,” I hummed to the song “The World Spins Madly On” by The Weepies as I lay sickly on my bed, resonating with the lyrics a bit more than I would expect. For that whole week, I was experiencing headaches, runny nose, and fatigue; yet I told myself that I was only beingdramatic. Imagine trying to lie to your own body. My body was demanding for rest and I was forcing myself to work. Only when I became so sick that I couldn’t leave my bed did I take the time to reflect and ask:Why was it so hard for me to accept the fact that I’m sick? Why was I so insistent on doing the same amount of work my healthy classmates are doing? What is with the shame around not doing work and resting? The answers to these questions revolutionized my thinking. Our campus, our culture and our world too often associate a lack of productivity as an indicator of laziness, and I want to advocate for a radical idea — resting is a form of resistance. To understand the concept of rest as a tool for social change, we have to contextualize the different cultures that we’re embedded in, first on campus and then in the broader world. The image of a duck calmly gliding across the water while frantically paddling its legs to keep up is a phenomenon known to most Stanford students. With the backdrop of the Californian sun and sandstone buildings, every single student you come across looks glowing and thriving. When I was sick, I felt this uncomfortable feeling in my stomach because everyone was moving forward while I was standing in place. Despite having a fever, I went to one of my classes and talked to my classmates, pretending as if everything was normal because of the fear of not doing enough. Even though I felt like I was the only one who was struggling, I’m sure I wasn’t the only duck. Time here doesn’t function as actual time but instead functions as a series of deadlines. Thursday isn’t Thursday but when a problem set is due. Even though time is actually moving, I feel static because I’m not working. My productivity measures my worth. Yet this belief isn’t my own individual mindset or is it exclusive to our campus: we as a society are all accomplice in ‘hustle culture’ and toxic productivity. Tricia Hersey, founder of theNap Ministry,traces America’s obsession with productivity to its history of white supremacy. The Transatlantic Slave Trade’s timeline from the 16th to 19th century observes millions of black people being enslaved, dehumanized and abused for their labor. Their bodies bore the most difficult and brutal work and the economic wealth accumulated through slavery was the foundation of American capitalism. “American slavery is necessarily imprinted on the DNA of American capitalism,” write thehistorians Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman. The wave of immigrants to the US during the colonial era also built upon the backbone of the economy, asdatapublished in the National Library of Medicine support. When Chinese immigrants first came to San Francisco in the 1850s due to political and economic tension in China, they largelycontributed to the construction of the Transcontinental Railroadthrough back-breaking labor. TheChinese Railroad Workers in North America Projectat Stanford University noted that white workers were unwilling to participate in such hazardous work so the demographic population for this work was 90% Chinese as the demand for labor increased. “Chinese received 30-50 percent lower wages than whites for the same job and they had to pay for their own food stuffs,”Chang says. “They also had the most difficult and dangerous work, including tunneling and the use of explosives. There is also evidence they faced physical abuse from some supervisors. They protested these and the long hours and they used their collective strength to challenge the company.” The symbol of workers’ strikes — refusing to work to rebel against the system — reverberates throughout history in other countries as well. Thefirst recorded labor strikehappened in ancient Egypt when tomb-builders protested late payment in 1159 BC. In 1856, stonemasons in Melbourne walked off their jobs to demand for reduced working hours. By taking strike action, they successfully negotiated the eight-hour day as the general industry standard in not just Australia, but also in other countries. Demanding for rest when the system is expecting you to work has become a symbol of resistance among marginalized communities around the world. While Hersey’s work directly challenges the relationship between black people and the work that they have been forced to do in America, grind culture exists in many other parts of the world and her philosophy on capitalism is more universal. “There’s this grind culture, which I say is white supremacy and capitalism, kind of blended together. It’s the thing that started when our ancestors were on plantations—the culture of seeing human beings as machines. The word ‘grind’ — when you think about gears and grinding on a machine — it sees our bodies and who we are as just being machines for production,” said Tricia Hersey inan interviewwith Prism Reports. If we are to learn anything from Hersey’s insight, it’s that the process of unlearning rest as a luxury and instead reconceptualizing rest as a necessity requires collective work. Radical nourishment is an idea of resting with intentionality. Czarina Jimenez reframes the practice of “self-care” by proposingcommunity-oriented activitiesthat pointedly oppose cultural norms like perfectionism or productivity. Practices of rest can take different forms such as co-creating arts, connecting to nature, listening to one’s bodies through meditation, and gardening. In addition, The Nap Ministry affirms the idea of rest as rebellion through collective napping experiences by converting public spaces such as parks, museums and art galleries into sacred and safe spaces. The notion of “napping” symbolizes a larger concept of getting the rest that our bodies desperately need. Taking care of your body through rest should be examined beyond the lens of mainstream wellness and self care. It is mentally and physically exhausting to fight off the system that prioritizes products instead of humanity. “To keep fighting to dismantle systems that don’t care about us, we must take care of our vessel,”wrote Mikeusha Vaughn. Tricia Hersey’s work calls for a new wave of individual and collective activism: we should rest in order to contribute to this political and social justice movement that disrupts different systems of oppression. Only by resting can we gather more strength to advocate for a more equitable and humane system."
wildcat_arizona_2022_2,"The college experience can be daunting for those who feel as though, they do not fit the traditional college student mold. (Illustration by Galadriel Gross I am a second generation Mexican American and the first woman in my family to attend a four-year university. The University of Arizona has ethnically diverse people of various ethnicities, and the experiences aren’t the same, especially for a woman of color. Being a woman of color, I am held to a different standard than someone whose family has been college-educated for generations. My family has not had the same opportunities as families that have been here for generations. According to Valeria Estrada fromTexas Woman’s University, “Hispanic women have not had an equal opportunity to education, but without evidence, this claim bears no weight. Evidence for this claim comes in many forms, one of which is discrimination.” I remembered the culture shock I felt walking to my classes the first day at the UA. I rarely saw anyone with my ethnic background, and it made me feel out of place and isolated. I felt as if I didn’t fit into the mold of the standard university student, and there was no one to guide me through it all. I am the oldest out of five and have parents who did not know how to start the college process, so I had to guide myself and eventually, my younger siblings. In a lot of cases similar to mine, this is a transformative experience that is more strenuous than that of the average young woman being dropped off to explore her beginning of adulthood. The adulthood that I was yet to experience made me question everything about myself and why I had to go through this alone. As I met other Latinx/Hispanic women, they often tell me about trying to not put yourself too much out there because people would simply not understand. I’ve seen in one particular incident where a good friend of mine dropped out due to the lack of support on campus and at home. I often hid from the crowds and tried to not stand out in the slightest. The independence of adulthood came with an overwhelming amount of insecurity that was rooted in being an outsider on campus. In anarticlefrom GBH news, Devin Karambelas wrote, “College is a transformative experience for any young adult, but it carries a special resonance for Latina women … encountering that kind of independence on a college campus — where in most cases women of color are already seriously underrepresented.” It was a lot of pressure on me and I felt alone in the beginning. But as time went on, the “college experience” got a lot better as I stopped worrying about being different. Women who came before me gave me this opportunity and I embraced it. I valued myself and stopped putting myself down. I found that the smallest reminders of my heritage helped me get through insecurity, whether it was a woman like me or even a plate of traditional Mexican food near campus. Somewhere in me, I understood that hiding who I am prevented me from going forth in the world to create the person I wanted to be. I am a senior now, and the last four years were difficult. My experience on campus as a Latinx/Hispanic woman has made me who I am. This experience that was handed to me and other Latinx/Hispanic women on campus strengthened us.

state_press_2022_55,"ASU needs to consider how they provide or neglect their community of Muslim students on campus. As the Iranian government s violent crackdown on this civil disobedience intensifies, it s more important than ever for ASU to be on the right side of history and condemn the Iranian regime. Following the murder ofMahsa (Jina Aminiat the hands of the Iranian morality police, Iranians are risking their lives to protest Iran s oppressive regime. As the Iranian government s violent crackdown on this civil disobedience intensifies, it s more important than ever for ASU to be on the right side of history and condemn the Iranian regime. Protesting for women s rights is nothing new for Iran, but the scale and unity of the current unrest are unprecedented. Iranians from diverse ethnic and social backgrounds are unified under one cause to fight against the Iranian regime, with previously dormant universities erupting in protests by staging walkouts and going on strike. This spirit of revolution has even spread to thousands ofhigh school girlsin Iran. Videos of schoolgirls throwing off compulsory hijabs and shutting down pro-regime administrators have rapidly spread online, among many others that showcase how girls and women are at the forefront of the movement. Souad T. Ali, founding chair of theASU Council for Arabic and Islamic Studies, believes that the killing of Mahsa (Jina Amini made Iranian women realize the extent of their oppression. For a young girl to die in custody just because she wasn’t wearing her veil correctly is very significant, Ali said. “What Iran is doing to women is completely wrong and has nothing to do with Islam, and now (the women of Iran are more aware of this. Ali also pointed to the regime s distortion of the Quran as another reason for the unrest. Imposing the hijab and/or veil on women contradicts the Quranic Verse Let there be no compulsion in religion, Ali said. While Islam requires a modest dress for both men and women willingly, it is sad to see some countries such as Iran, and some radicals and extremist Muslims, try to enforce their distorted patriarchal interpretation of the Quran on women. Ali hopes the University will make an intentional effort to support its Iranian community. All Muslim students and faculty at ASU are impacted by these violent events, Ali said. ASU should issue a strong response in support of (the people of Iran. Rasoul Foroughfard, a member of theIranian Student Association, agrees that condemning the regime would help students feel supported by the University. “Other universities have officially condemned what the regime is doing,” Foroughfard said. “If they see that the University cares by condemning what s happening in Iran, they will feel like ASU cares about their concerns.” At the time of publication, ASU has made no public statement regarding Iranian students and their safety on and off campus. ASU President Michael Crow in March released a statement in early March supporting students affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. When asked about Iranian student support in a meeting with The State Press earlier this month, Crow said the University is all ears for student demands, but has no plans to make a public statement. “We respond to things where there’s something we can do. We don’t comment on everything going on all over the world. We don’t do that. But we do pick up on our tools if there’s something we can do, Crow said. ASU is a University that centers inclusivity and diversity in itscharter, meant to be a home away from home for its students. That means making intentional efforts to make them feel supported, especially in times of crisis that affect certain students disproportionately. Apathy from the University is unacceptable in the face of a crisis as major as the one in Iran. ASU should release a statement condemning the regime, and commit to creating an environment that fully supports its Iranian student body.

crimson_2022_120,"The sound of laughter almost never fills me with cold, debilitating anger. But the screeches of overconfident amusement bellowing from my peers as we processed Will Smith confronting Chris Rock’s insensitive joke at the Academy Awards did just that. Instead of yelling, I shook my head, desperately trying to dispel what my voice longed to say: Please stop and have some empathy. I am sorry for writing this piece. I cannot imagine millions of people mischaracterizing and dehumanizing my name — my life — all without my knowledge or permission. For contributing to this toxic culture, I am guilty. But to me this is ultimately about more than Will Smith and Chris Rock. It’s about how people of color are expected to stay dignified, regardless of the personal slights hurled their way; the moment they decide to express the anger that is rightfully theirs, they are vilified, disregarded, and laughed at. And I am so sick of it. This sickness stems from my youth, when I promised myself I would break unjust rules and incite social change. My naive heart broke when my dad followed my declarations with what I now recognize as wise advice. Pick your battles. Yelling at the racist man at the diner who slams a door in your face won’t make a difference. But it can ruin your reputation, and somewhere down the line, you’re going to need it for something that can make a difference. It’s why schools all too often teach us about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. but not Malcolm X. In the vital fight for justice, only ideas reframed as palatable are revered in the mainstream. I can’t and won’t speak for all people of color. I speak only from my experiences as a mixed, brown girl, who took her dad’s words to heart. Since that day, my reputation has been my primary concern, keeping me from breaking even the smallest of norms. When I listened to Smith’s carefully chosen words, I saw a man who was tired. Tired of constantly having to smile and laugh. Someone who has painted himself as a respectable artist, starring in innocent comedies like “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” or “Men in Black.” And who has dedicated himself for over two decades to using his untainted reputation to share the stories of inspiring Black men like Muhammad Ali, Chris Gardner, and most recently, Richard Williams, in a performance that earned him his first Academy Award. But the Academy Awards have historically not been receptive of Black artists, regardless of their talent. For Smith, this was a battle he saw worth fighting. In 2016, Will and Jada-Pinkett Smith bothboycottedthe Academy Awards in protest of the lack of diversity in the acting nominees. We witnessed powerful stories in film this year. Those of us who watched with an open heart and active ear could not have missed the limited but significant presence of Black artists. As I did my best to drown out the uproar pouring out from my peers as they scrambled to rewatch the clip, I took in Questlove’s acceptance speech for his documentary “Summer of Soul” and gratefully teared up at his words of its cultural importance. While the wails of laughter increased when Smith finally got his moment on stage, my respect for him only soared. I saw a Black man who had to fight — possibly by not fighting — in order to get to where he is today. A man who believes so much in his work. A man who values his family. A man who expressed in his speech how disturbing it is to be in the public eye. He does not deserve an audience that will only remember him for picking a battle they deemed inappropriate, refusing to acknowledge the depth of his career and life. People of color are exhausted for so many reasons. And if Oscars-night showed me anything, it’s that we have reason to be. We could live our entire lives with the best of intentions, gain the respect of the entire world, and finally win the award we deserve — not to mention an award symbolizing the impact of the story we truly longed to tell. And in an instant, we may become a laughing stock simply because of a choice to express a perfectly natural human response: anger. We’re not allowed to say we’ve had enough. We’re not permitted a breaking point. I still believe in the words my father told me, and have abandoned all hope of changing the world. I have no harsh feelings towards those I shared Oscars night with. They struck me as perfectly well-intentioned, kind people whom I would never even think to call bigoted, and I am honored to know a few of them. But I hope, if nothing else, that those who chose to laugh at Smith in his most vulnerable moment will recognize that they were unintentionally laughing at every person of color who ever dared to be human.

state_press_2022_54,"ASU needs to better advertise its existing reproductive health care resources, in addition to making them more accessible to students across its campuses. In a post-Roe landscape, access to reproductive health care options and resources on campus are more critical than ever. ASU needs to better advertise its existing reproductive health care resources, in addition to making them more accessible to students across its campuses. After the overturning of Roe v. Wade left abortion regulation to the states, the previously uncertain abortion landscape in Arizona shifted to the extreme. On Sept. 23, a Pima County judgelifted the injunctionon a law that bans abortions after 15 weeks in all cases except when it is necessary to save (the mother s life, with no exceptions for rape or incest. For now, enforcement of the ruling is on hold after it was blocked by a three-judge panel in the Arizona Court of Appeals. This allows Planned Parenthood to resume providing abortion procedures until the courts reach a final decision. READ MORE:This is what we know about where abortion rights currently stand in Arizona This limbo leaves Arizona residents confused and nervous for the future. In this uncertain climate, ASU should be doing its best to provide students comfort and security through increasing student access to sexual health services. Access to physical resources is limited to certain campuses, which could be in part due to misconceptions surrounding students sexual activity. Melanie Buathier, education coordinator ofDevils in the Bedroomand a junior studying forensic science and biology, said these misconceptions could affect the supply of contraceptives and sex education resources across ASU campuses. In Tempe, there s this idea that Tempe students are all sexually active, Buathier said. It could be detrimental to students on other campuses because all the resources are concentrated in the Tempe campus, so the other campuses are neglected. Buathier said if the University thinks that Tempe is the most sexually active campus, then (they don t really need to worry about the other campuses. According toSun Devils Against Sexual Assault, existing resources aren t sufficient to adequately protect students from dangerous situations like sexual violence. According to feedback SDASA collected, 90% of ASU students think ASU s Sexual and Relationship Violence Prevention program is ineffective, which is ASU s biggest resource related to reproductive justice issues. With such a large amount of students not having faith in the program s effectiveness, ASU should provide and promote confidential resources and actively seek to improve them rather than standing by. When The State Press reached out to ASU Health Services, a spokesperson provideda comprehensive list of sexual health and reproductive health care resourcesonline. The problem, then, is ASU s insufficient advertising. People don t know it exists, Buathier said. SDASA confirmed this sentiment for resources relating to sexual violence in an email to The State Press. According to its statement, rather than advertising confidential victim advocates as a first point of contact for sexual and relationship violence victims, ASU directs students to Student Advocacy and Assistance as a first point of contact, which may trigger an unwanted University investigation and potentially expose the student to retaliation. If a student tells Student Advocacy & Assistance they need help accessing contraception or abortion resources because they were sexually assaulted by another student, Student Advocacy & Assistance staff are required to report the student s disclosure to investigative offices that may initiate an investigation even if the student doesn t want an investigation to happen, SDASA wrote. This major oversight prevents students from receiving important reproductive care, and prevents victims of sexual violence from receiving the support they need. ASU needs to prioritize both aggressively advertising and recalibrating the available resources in order for students to properly utilize them. ASU needs to stand by itscharter, which outlines the University s fundamental responsibility for the overall health of the communities it serves. With Arizona s political climate undermining the right to reproductive healthcare, ASU needs to demonstrate it firmly stands by its students, the people that make ASU s thriving community and reputation possible, and that it will do everything in its power to support victims of sexual violence.Advertising reproductive health services and making reproductive resources more effective is the first step.

crimson_2022_121,"Dear Harvard College, I am writing to let you know that I am resigning as student body president, effective immediately. I was elected on the signature promise of dissolving and replacing the Undergraduate Council. Since that’s been fulfilled, I must step aside so we can turn to our next chapter. Many generations of Harvard undergraduates before us have debatedchangingorendingthe Undergraduate Council. Forty years after the Undergraduate Council’s establishment, this generation found the political will to take a decisive step. Nearly 4,000 undergraduatesvotedin the referendum (57.2 percent voter turnout — the highest number of votes cast in any Undergraduate Council election since 2004. You chose to establish a new, action-oriented student association that aims to better serve all of us and generations of students to come. I am excited to see you participate in the initial elections and bring your aspirations for our University to this new system. The last few months have taught us a lot. They have shown that we are capable of coming together, listening respectfully to others’ points of view, and turning our principles and ideals into reality. Leadership requires imagination, a willingness to question systems and think beyond established boxes. Those interested in the state of the public sphere should enter leadership roles, do what they promised to the best of their ability, and know when to leave. It’s time to focus on the future that you voted for. The transition to that future must be as seamless as possible. As per the new constitution, Emmett E. de Kanter ’24 will immediately assume the role of President and serve until new elections have been held in several weeks. Emmett will be your final UC President, and he has selected Christopher T. Cantwell ’22-’23 to serve as Vice President because of his independence and integrity. Chris is a Computer Science and Government concentrator in Leverett House who has served as a mediator on the UC this past semester, helped write the new constitution, and has years of nonpartisan civic experience from work with the Harvard Votes Challenge. Emmett and Chris will not run for elected positions in the HUA. Their top priority is a smooth, successful transition, with elections staying as civil and policy-focused as possible. I would like to thank you again for the honor and privilege of serving as your president. I’m grateful that we were able tolaunchResearch Snackchats to connect students with experienced researchers and mentors, improve the Harvard administration’s transparency on Covid-19 policies,pilotnew approaches to digital democracy,workwith Harvard University Dining Services to offer new options and improve food quality, andhelpestablish Double Concentrations to provide more academic flexibility. As of this morning, every Harvard undergraduate has received a $10 Crimson Cash refund from the UC’s financial dissolution. I hope that this small gesture (toward printing, laundry, or food begins to restore confidence in what student governance at Harvard is capable of. In my last weeks at Harvard, I look forward to getting lost in used bookstores, playing video games like Tales of Symphonia and Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, and spending time with friends and teammates. I am excited for my spring season with HVL (the varsity men’s lightweight rowing team , the first place at Harvard where I could be accepted for who I am, with all my imperfections. To everyone who believes in a better Harvard — thank you so much for being part of this journey. I wish you the best for the rest of your time at Harvard and beyond. I leave you with a quote from “The True Harvard,” a 1903 speech by Harvard philosopher William James: “As a nursery for independent and lonely thinkers I do believe that Harvard still is in the van. Here they find the climate so propitious that they can be happy in their very solitude. The day when Harvard shall stamp a single hard and fast type of character upon her children, will be that of her downfall. Our undisciplinables are our proudest product. Let us agree together in hoping that the output of them will never cease.” Michael Y. Cheng ’22, a History and Mathematics concentrator in Quincy House, was president of the Undergraduate Council."
crimson_2022_24,"Apple picking, trips to Salem, chill air, and freshmen fiending for parties — fall really is in full swing at Harvard. Now that the luster of the first few weeks has worn off and the panic and exhaustion of midterms season has set in, there is another familiar experience that has reemerged: the plight of the chronically late individual. Marked by a hasty scramble out the door (following a similarly hasty scramble out of bed , anxious foot-tapping on the shuttle, repeated watch-checking, and the occasional sprint across campus, the chronically late individual never quite seems to have enough time. I, too, have been known to wake up for 9 a.m. classes at 8:50 or catch the 10:30 shuttle for my 10:30 class. (You will never catch me running, though — I’ve decided to adopt the long-stride-better-late-than-never mentality . It’s never that much of a problem; I usually stroll in and awkwardly find a seat about five minutes late — by all means on time. At least it used to be. Along with so many once-touted and beloved institutional traditions, Harvard Time is gone. Boasting its own page onUrban Dictionary, Harvard Time was once defined as “Seven minutes later than real time. A comment on how classes at Harvard start 7 minutes after they are listed (example: at 10:07 instead of at 10:00 to allow time for students who must cross the campus from one class to another.” The beginning of the end of Harvard Time was marked by an institutional scheduling change to 75-minute class blocks which allotted 15 minutes of passing time between all classes, obviating the need for the deeply ingrained seven-minute delay that had come to define every scheduled event on campus. While professors tried to follow the new schedule immediately, it seems the change was less sudden in the hearts and minds of Harvard students. The real death of the grace period can probably be traced to the same thing that changed many aspects of normalcy for good: the Covid-19 pandemic. Rolling out of bed and logging into a Zoom call made punctuality a lot easier. In the 2-D classroom, there was hardly a need to wait for people to trickle in. And, with the help of the institutional memory gaps that erased many already-fading campus traditions, this new, Harvard-time-less world has stuck. Professors and TFs alike tend to start right on the dot and students usually arrive moments before — most students, anyway. There remains the question of the chronically late. Sure, the problem faced by these select tardy people may easily be remedied by rushing out the door 10 minutes sooner. And perhaps this should be a lesson in punctuality. But I’d prefer to think of it as one piece of Harvard that most of us never got to experience. Maybe the fact that so many of us didn’t have the opportunity to be on time seven minutes late is precisely what makes it sound so appealing. Harvard is stressful enough without the unbridled anxiety that accompanies sleeping through an alarm. Beyond the missed shuttle or the awkward silence as you shuffle into a seat, we tend to immediately panic over the smallest things. In this light, a bit of good-natured flexibility in what so often feels like a rigid system is just the reprieve we need. And, after all, we have the rest of our lives to be punctual. Harvard culture fosters an unattainable need to be perfect all of the time. It’s exhausting. It’s restrictive. And, paradoxically, it keeps us from improving by constructing and reifying environments that are inhospitable to the growth that comes from making mistakes. The removal of Harvard Time makes this manifest — what little institutional forgiveness we’ve had for small mishaps continue to fall away. Reinstating Harvard Time, however, is not the answer. In fact, it would be contrary to my whole point: that beyond any one idiosyncratic tradition, sometimes we just need to be a little less strict. We can and should resist the inexorable pull to systematize everything. It is time to consciously give ourselves the grace of 7 minutes before letting the gravity of a situation set in. Be kind to yourself and others. Know that very few things are worth breaking into a sprint for. Take your time.

It is all too true that arts organizationsstill fall shortof creating accessible spaces with equitable representation of artists. For instance, white men still make up themajority of artists representedin prominent museums across the United States. Even with increased attention to elevating the work of women artists and an uptick in women-only art shows and exhibitions focused on the work of underrepresented artists, only11% of permanent acquisitionsby major American art museums from 2008 to 2019 were by women; of that 11%, only 3.3.% were by Black women artists. Houston is not exempt from the inequities that plague the art industry, but this makes it all that more important to support art in the city created by underrepresented artists. If you enjoy theatre or want to trade in a night of Netflix for live entertainment, Theatre Under the Stars’“Ain’t Misbehavin’”is a tribute to the music of Fat Waller and the Harlem Renaissance. The show opens Sept. 22 and features anall-Black cast and creative team.Ensemble Theatreaims to “preserve African American artistic expression,” and their production of“Love and Southern D!scomfort”also opens Sept. 22 and is showing through Oct. 16. For a nationally acclaimed performance, “Six,” the musical reimagining of the lives of England’s King Henry VIII’s wives, features a diverse, all-woman cast and band. Watch how they “divorced, beheaded, died,” when this woman-centric show comes to the Hobby Center Nov. 8 - 20. Do you frequent Shepherd School performances? Watch “Viva Latin America” by theHouston Latin American PhilharmonicOct. 15 at Cullen Theater to end Hispanic Heritage Month. Walk to the Museum District to see “Amoako Boafo: Soul of Black Folks” on display at the Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston through Oct. 2. Close by is the Menil Collection, where art-enthusiasts can see “Samuel Fosso: African Spirits” through Jan. 15. This is only the start of the ever-growing amount of art to see in the city, from performances to exhibitions to the ever-present and ever-popular murals that adorn Houston’s cityscape. There are plentiful opportunities to experience art in many mediums near and far from campus, so we urge the Rice community to visit and engage with underrepresented artists who are too often overlooked.

stanforddaily_2022_2,"Like many of you, I have been following The Daily’s reporting of theresearch misconduct allegations against MTL. It’s been a unique experience seeing this firsthand as a Ph.D. student and subsequent discussions with my friends and peers all point to something — it’s not so much the manipulated images that trouble us, it’s the question of why there were any manipulated images to begin with. In scientific research in the U.S., the role of thePrincipal Investigatoror PI is mainly to secure and administrate funding for their research ideas in the forms of grants, fellowships, awards, etc. The mainday-to-day researchis carried out by a combination of graduate students, postdocs, research scientists and undergraduates. This is not to say that PIs do not engage in the laboratory at all; they actively do by guiding students through obstacles, generating new ideas and helping in the experiments themselves. Besides setting the direction of the lab, they are responsible for setting expectations for the lab — more specifically, the environment in which researchers operate. This leads to an implicit trust contract; the PI trusts the researcher to carry out their vision, and the researcher trusts the PI in their decisions regarding the researchers themselves. That trust carries over to data generation; it is expected that the data generated is the responsibility of the researcher themselves and is not manipulated nor misleading. Based on this contract and my own experience as a researcher, I doubt that MTL has had a direct hand in manipulating the images/figures in the papers. However,research groups should have an environmentthat leads to the free-flow exchange of ideas and data — an environment determined by the PI. Data by itself is neutral; some data may show that the hypothesis is plausible; some data may cause entire ideas to disintegrate; most data prompts changes in researchdirection. But this data should be freely available and debatable across members of a research team. So my question is: what kind of environment led to researchers publishing potentially misleading data? Was it a results-based environment where there was pressure to generate positive results? Was it an environment where there was a significant breakdown of communication between members of the research team? Was it an environment that resulted from ethical negligence from the PI? So my question to MTL is — what kind of environment were you leading where many papers of which you were a co-author ended up with doctored images? Were you honestly doing the best you could to protect the integrity of your research group? And even if you weren’t directly involved in the research that produced the images asyou stated in your letter, shouldn’t you have exercised due diligence on the results presented? I agree that any research misconduct will be hard to prove given that the papers were published close to two decades ago, so much of the original data would be destroyed or hard to find. Research itself is a stressful endeavor, and even with a PI’s best intentions, members of their team can have lapses of judgment. However, make no mistake,research misconduct has harmful consequencesto the field of science as a whole. It undermines public trust, leads to false directions of new research and wastes human and financial resources. That being said, mistakes are normal in the manuscript writing process; typos, incorrect graph labels and references do sometimes manage to escape the peer-review and editing process despite best intentions. Currently, MTL has at leasteight papers under scrutiny— one or two is a mistake, three to four is a problem, and at eight it starts to look intentional (keeping in mind that it may not be as pervasive as some have suggested . Furthermore, these aren’t just any mistakes,these are allegations of image manipulation. MTL and the University have consistently made the defense that such “mistakes” don’tharm the overall results of the paper or that he had no involvement with the doctored images. These myriad ways of shirking responsibility essentially add up to the “I am only human” excuse. But MTL does not get to use that excuse; he is the president of Stanford University. He is the face of our University; he not only represents our faculty, students and staff, but he also represents the research and output of the University. He is our leader, and even if he wasn’t democratically elected, he is supposed to represent the best of us — his impressive resume gave credence to that appointment. We hold leaders to higher standards because we trust that they will make the best decisions for us. We trust that when they bleed, they bleed for us; when they cry, they cry for us; and when they speak, they speak for us. In Lance Armstrong’s infamous doping case, the cyclist wasspecifically targetedby the USADA not just because of his illegal performance enhancement, but because he was a leader: the public face of cycling who improperly used his influence to intimidate other cyclists who spoke up about Armstrong’s PED use. Marc Tessier-Lavigne, I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt that you weren’t directly involved in the data manipulation. However, as a leader, you need to step down or step aside for the time being. Right now, you no longer represent the best of us — because ultimately, in each of these papers that have been identified, you were a leader on that research team and ultimately responsible. You should have been in charge of making sure that the work that bore your name was held to the highest integrity. As a PI, you were in charge of ensuring a positive and honest environment in your laboratories. Instead, those environments may have become negligent — or, at worst, intentionally harmful. When you were chosen to be president, you made a statement in yourinaugural address:“Let us commit to being a purposeful university.” You defined a purposeful university as one that is fearless, promoting and celebrating excellence and boldly advancing the good of humanity. I ask you — are you truly living up to your ideal of being a purposeful leader? Are you truly reflecting the excellence outlined in your speech? Are you truly fearless? If not, MTL, please step aside or step down until the investigation concludes — because that is the right thing to do.

wildcat_arizona_2022_3,"The inside of Gallagher Theater in the Student Union Memorial Center on April 11, 2019. The theater is also used as a classroom. In a world where higher education is a privilege not everyone has access to, it may seem that if you can go to university, you should. However, that is not always the case. Going to university and getting a degree can be a powerful resource for your future, however, it doesn’t guarantee success or happiness. I believe that depending on your personal life and career goals, higher education isn’t a requirement. Some of the most influential and successful people were college dropouts. According toCBS News, Steve Jobs, Oprah Winfrey, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steven Spielberg are some of many notable people who did not obtain a college degree. One important factor to consider if college is the right choice for you is debt. Depending on what career you choose, it may be worth your while to obtain some debt. In some cases, higher education will lead to a specific high-paying career. This includes jobs in the medical field, engineering and law. However, if your career goals are something with less specific requirements, debt is not a good idea. I believe that if you want to obtain a degree in something broader, it is much more beneficial to pursue a debt-free option, like community college or in-state tuition. There are also other options for less college education-oriented careers. Trade schools are a great way to obtain specific skill sets without breaking the bank. Real estate and beauty schools are two examples of trade schools. These are simply other options for people who still feel a desire to pursue an education past high school. However, it is understandable that going to school isn’t right for everyone. Many may find that life just working, traveling and living is a much more satisfactory path. Networking is an amazing skill that does not come from a university degree. Knowing the right people in the right places at the right time can lead to enormous success. Putting yourself out there and being your own biggest advocate can lead to tremendous rewards. I firmly believe that confidence can get you anywhere in life. If you truly believe in yourself, others will too. No level of education can teach you how to exude confidence. It is something each individual must discover for themselves. I like to think of success as a cookie recipe. Everyone has a different preference for cookie types. Flavors, texture, size, toppings, all of these factors make up everyone’s personal favorite cookie. There is no one-size-fits-all cookie, just as the definition of success isn’t one-size-fits all. To some people, higher education is a key ingredient in their cookie recipe. And to others, it is not. Therefore, it is unacceptable to judge others on their choices, and their definition of success, since it is unique to everyone. Personally, I have no idea what ingredients go in my cookie recipe. Success is something each person needs to define on their own and discover what truly makes them feel like they are the human being they want to be in this world.

stanforddaily_2022_128,"We have come a long way from the first pilot roundabout at Stanford in 2014 to six roundabouts in full operation on the main campus today. Roundabouts are designed to promote a continuous, circular flow of traffic to improve safety, so why do some people continue to use the outdated “Circle of Death” reference? Today, real roundabouts deserve to be rebranded as Circles of Life! Roundabouts are designed to improve safety for drivers, pedestrians and bicyclists at points of convergence in busy intersections. Studies have shown that roundabouts are safer than traditional stop signs or traffic signal-controlled intersections. They work primarily by reducing vehicle speed, forcing pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers alike to pay greater attention to traffic and making it clear who has the right of way. There may be a short learning curve on how to navigate roundabouts, but the benefits are plentiful. Roundabouts have far fewer conflict points compared to traditional intersections, and they are relatively intuitive by design. Creative roundabouts at Stanford Stanford’s roundabouts address the special traffic and travel patterns on campus. For instance, the roundabout on Galvez Street at Arboretum Road has a bypass lane that enables vehicles to avoid the roundabout entirely if the driver is heading north on Galvez Street and their destination is El Camino Real. This maintains traffic flow at peak commute hours and during special events on campus, like Cardinal football games. On Jane Stanford Way, the multiple mini-roundabouts were upgraded by Campus Planning & Design in 2020. The improvements include directional signage on sidewalks and a wider circumference to accommodate students during breaks when ridership is high. Kudos to our Project Management and Campus Planning & Design Team for initiating roundabouts at Stanford and creating what will be a legacy of landmarks throughout campus! Show me the data On a national level, roundabouts reduced injury crashes by 75% at intersections where stop signs or traffic signals were previously used for traffic control, according to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS . Studiesby the IIHS and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA have shown that roundabouts typically achieve the following: Ride right in the “Circles of life” Roundabouts work best when all users know how to navigate them. Here are three simple steps to take: Stanford tips on navigating roundabouts We recently published aGetting Around Campus Safelyarticle with more details and helpful tips for navigating roundabouts, whether you are riding, walking or driving. We also have a dedicated webpage with resources:Get Around Safely. To help new students start off on the right foot, we offered a hands-on workshop on roundabouts and how to ride around Marguerite buses on campus. Students sat in the Marguerite driver’s seat, using the bus’ mirrors to see fellow students riding around the bus. It was an eye-opening experience, which you can learn more about in our “New Stanford Students Learn to Navigate Roundabouts and Buses”article.

thetech_mit_2022_56,"As a graduate resident advisor (GRA , I provide guidance, resources, and a sense of community to the undergraduate students that live in MIT’s residential facilities. I live with and get to know my residents, help them build community with each other through social events, and support them as they navigate the challenges of being college students. Interviewing to be a GRA at MIT is a very thorough process, involving multiple rounds of interviews with both housing staff and students. In return for GRA-ing, I do not pay rent for my room. While working for an institution thatplans for graduate student-workers to be severely rent burdened, the ability to save money on a graduate stipend is a huge financial advantage. Starting my first semester as a GRA last fall, I was thrilled to get started and meet all my residents. However, I quickly discovered numerous issues. When I moved into my room, the ceiling leaked every time it rained. It stayed this way for three months. MIT administration has neglected to maintain their buildings for years, all while charging the same price for a crumbling building. Simple tasks like repairing the washer are left on hold for months with no update on when the repairs will be performed.MIT has identified over $2 billion in maintenance backlog on campus, and by their own admission, many of the undergraduate houses are in “poor condition.” Like many other GRAs, I quickly discovered how hard it was to advocate for myself in this role. When submitting requests for repairs, my concerns were quickly written off as a personal failure rather than an earnest request. In response to issues with heating that left me working in my room at my desk in a down jacket and sleeping in my winter camping sleeping bag liner, I was advised to use the thermostat. Trying to maintain adequate living conditions was exhausting, frustrating, and totally disruptive to my research, my studies, and my GRA responsibilities. I was placed in the precarious situation of having to report concerns to the very people that could drop me as a GRA at any time for any reason. (The GRA agreement states: “An appointment may be terminated at any time if your House Leadership and/or Residential Education determine you are not fulfilling all written expectations and/or the responsibility of the role” . Initially, I felt like I didn’t have a right to raise concerns about my living situation — “You don’t pay rent,” I would tell myself. “How can you possibly complain?” The extent of the issues with my living space ultimately left me without a choice, but coordinating meetings with MIT’s administration requires immense effort despite inconsistent results. These issues are not uncommon for GRAs. Moreover, it’s not just GRAs who are affected by building negligence. The students living in these houses deserve to have a building that is liveable and fully functioning. And if we as GRAs can’t even get our own heating fixed in a reasonable time, how can we possibly help our undergraduates overcome their own challenges at MIT? How would a union help? When the union reached out to me after hearing about my ceiling, they provided me with legal resources and support, even before being officially recognized. It was immensely helpful to have a group of fellow graduate student-workers helping me figure out how to navigate my situation, especially because I had exhausted all formal channels. With a union, GRAs and all other graduate students will have the collective power we need to resolve our issues. We would be able to: Negotiate a contract: GRA working and living conditions are related to the larger housing issue, which will be a major concern in negotiations with MIT. File grievances:With a union, GRAs could file grievances to resolve our issues together rather than being forced to deal with them as isolated individuals who can easily be ignored. Have a permanent organization to fight for our needs: MIT has already shown, and is showing right now, that they do respond to pressure when we’re organized. The union provides an ongoing organization that can apply that pressure when we need it. Graduate students deserve decent living conditions, and a union can provide the support for even niche situations like mine to make sure my voice is heard. To win our union, we need to show MIT that we are united by signing theVOTE YES PETITIONand showing up to vote yes for our union April 4–5. Sydney Dolan is a third-year PhD student in AeroAstro and a GRA of a sorority. Ki-Jana Carter is a fifth-year PhD student in Materials Science and Engineering and a GRA in Baker House. Alyssa Rudelis is a fourth-year PhD student in Physics and a GRA in Maseeh Hall. Editor’s Note:It should be noted thatGRAs who are not separately employed as a research assistant, teaching assistant, or instructor G and undergraduates are not eligible to vote per the National Labor Relations Board’srequirements. According to a recentletterfrom Chancellor Melissa Nobles and Vice Chancellor Ian Waitz, MIT is not legally obligated to and would not negotiate over housing as a part of collective bargaining because the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America would represent “just a portion of its graduate students” and that “labor bargaining is primarily about the terms and conditions of employment.”"

For additional resources, contact the national sexual assault hotline at800-656-4673or visit the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network’swebsite. Since theoverturning ofRoe V. Wadein June, the weight of continuous attacks on sexual freedom and reproductive rights has been especially heavy for women and sexual assault survivors. Arizona residents are left particularly vulnerable, with lack of clarity on state abortion policies and mass shutdowns of Planned Parenthood clinics. Now, more than ever, ASU must establish the Campus Assault Advocacy Resources & Education Center. Sun Devils Against Sexual Assaulthas worked tirelessly for years to raise awareness for the severity of on-campus sexual assault and expose the failings of ASU’s resources for survivors. After countless personal stories, meetings with administration, student protests and a formal proposal for the CAARE Center, ASU still does not have a sexual assault crisis center. READ MORE:Student groups protest for better sexual assault services from ASU According toLive Well at ASU,42.2% of ASU students report having a sexual partner within the last 12 months, meaning there is no denying that many students are sexually active. Of these students, many express concern for establishing a centralized sexual resource center on campus. “The fight for a CAARE Center this late in ASU’s ‘legacy’ grossly showcases how badly we need (the center , but it also shows that ASU administration is putting survivors on the back burner, Hannah Hunicke, a graduate student majoring in higher and postsecondary education, said. ASU s lack of support is felt campus-wide, displayed by the dozens of student groups who have endorsed the CAARE Center proposal. Whilerape cultureexists everywhere, sexual misconduct is known to beprevalent in greek lifecommunities, which have a strong presence at ASU. The party culture within greek life society leaves many members vulnerable to assault and in need of resources. Senior environmental chemistry major and ASU Chi Omega member Kiahra Jones advocates for a resource center that allows students to know their options for birth control, sexually transmitted disease testing and support for survivors. These issues are of immediate concern for women involved in sororities and fraternities. “(Fraternal communities do not always have the health and safety of the women in their community as a priority, and they’re not always reliable advocates for women who find themselves in hard situations, Jones said. “A women’s care center could be a really good thing. Jones also points out that if such a center is created, precautions should be taken to ensure that it is a safe place for its community. Many crisis centers are targeted by radical groups who are committed to steering people away and making them uncomfortable or shameful. ASU should keep this in mind if they commit to establishing such a center. ASU administration’s response to these concerns has been apathetic, as they claim that ASU already has the resources students may need. ASU only has two victim advocates and three prevention staff, abysmal numbers for a University of over 77,300 students on-campus in the Phoenix metro area. Multiple assault survivors have come forward with stories of complacency, interrogation and harassment when seeking help from ASU’s crisis services. Instead of being met with compassionate medical care and emotional support, survivors are often met with unaccommodating law enforcement without other support. ASU Health Services fails to provide survivors medical forensic exams. Astudyby the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network found that only 20% of college-aged women who experience sexual assault report it. Fear of retaliation and inefficiency in police reporting are among the many reasons women choose to stay silent. ASU is perpetuating this cycle of non-reporting by refusing to comply with the demands of their student population to create a crisis center. On Sept. 19, a student forum with ASU President Michael Crow is being held in person and over Zoom. SDASA is encouraging the community to share their concerns and ask President Crow, Why won t ASU hire more sexual violence prevention staff and confidential victim advocates? ASU’s complacency with sexual abuse in their student community is disappointing and irresponsible. Bringing concerns to the attention of administration is crucial. A CAARE Center is vital to ensure the safety of students, who are even more vulnerable amidst the severe attacks on women’s bodily autonomy.

Connie Young Yu is the great-granddaughter of a laborer on the Central Pacific. She is the author of Chinatown, San Jose, USA and co-editor of Voices from the Railroad: Stories by Descendants of Chinese Railroad Workers. We wish to thank the Arboretum Chinese Labor Quarters project for its ongoing efforts, guided by experts such as Barbara Voss, Laura Jones, Julie Cain, Garrett Trask, Christina Hodge, Megan Victor, Christopher Lowman and many others. We are extremely grateful for the Chinese Railroad Workers of North America Project, led by historians Gordon H. Chang and Shelley Fisher Fishkin, with the help of Hilton Obenzinger, Roland Hsu and Prof. Voss. We invite students, alumni and other Stanford community members interested in these issues to reach out to us atkhsu@alumni.stanford.eduandkatydid@alumni.stanford.edu. There’s nothing like the feeling of entering Stanford University through the majestic, tree-lined approach of Palm Drive. More than 130 years ago, a Chinese man named Jim Mok and a team of Chinese gardeners employed by the Stanfords labored together to plant the166 palm treesthat would one day become emblematic of the University.1 In fact, hundreds of Chinese workers also leveled the terrain, laid building foundations and set up other vital physical infrastructure (including the subterraneansteam tunnels needed for a functioning university campus.2More than 100 of these workers werestill employedin the 1890s, when thefirst studentsmatriculated and graduated.3The fascinating history of Chinese laborers on campus has been unearthed by a dedicatedgroup of Stanford archaeologistsworking at the Arboretum archaeological site on campus, yet their stories (like too many others remain largely unknown to students, faculty and alumni — and as a result, uncelebrated. It is time for the University to definitively acknowledge the contributions of Chinese Americans in its founding and most formative years. We are grateful to the faculty and student researchers who have meticulously documented many of these stories, but it is the University’s responsibility as an institution to publicize this history both within the Stanford community and in the public sphere. From its inception, Stanford University has benefited from the contributions of Asian Americans, including these unsung Chinese workers. Even so, the institution’s relationship with Chinese Americans in particular has been anything but straightforward. As the United States concludes its annual celebration ofAsian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AAPI Heritage Month, it is appropriate to pause and critically examine Stanford’s complicated legacy — that of Leland Stanford Sr.the man, as well asthe institutionhe and his wife Jane founded to honor their son, Leland Jr. Leland Stanford Sr. amassed his vast fortune by presiding over the Central Pacific Railroad, as one of the Big Fourrobber baronsleading the organization.Chinese laborers, primarily from Guangdong, constituted 90% of the company’s workforce. They were often assigned the most dangerous work, such as setting off explosives and digging tunnels through unyielding granite.4When thetranscontinental railroadthat linked the nation’s two coasts was completed in 1869, it was largely due to these workers’ blood, sweat and tears, despitebeing compensated significantly lessthan white laborers. Yet as Professor Gordon Changdescribes, Leland Stanford’s attitude toward the Chinese was “tense, ambivalent and complex.”5Stanford the politician pandered to nativists and embraced anti-Chinese hate as a matter of political expediency. In hisinaugural speechas Governor of California in January 1862, he said: “To my mind it is clear, that the settlement among us of an inferior race is to be discouraged by every legitimate means. Asia, with her numberless millions, sends to our shores the dregs of her population. … There can be no doubt but that the presence among us of numbers of degraded and distinct people must exercise a deleterious influence upon the superior race, and to a certain extent, repel desirable immigration.”6 Within a couple years, Stanford’s own Central Pacific Railroad Company would be hiring the same despised Chinese labor. Through interactions with his employees, Stanford revised his earlier opinions of the Chinese and admitted that they were intelligent, hardworking and loyal servants.7Yet as a newly elected U.S. Senator from California, he spoke to Congress in support of additional legislation to curtail the Chinese presence in America, declaring, “Chinamen have played an important part in the development of that section of the country by the work they have done in the building up of railroads and in other improvements, as well as manufactures; but the limit of their usefulness has been reached. ​​Not only should no more be allowed to come into the country, but those now here should be gradually returned.”8 This ambivalence manifested throughout his politics, as he publicly called for federal restrictions on Chinese immigration,endorsedthe 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act barring Chinese laborers from immigrating to the United States andaffirmedthe 1892 Geary Act extending these restrictions.9At the same time, Chinese workers operated and maintained his familyproperties, including avineyard, the Stanfordmansionatop San Francisco’s Nob Hill (at the time, the “largest private residence” in the state and the Palo Altostock farmthat eventually became the campus of Stanford University.10 During this period when anti-Chinese hatred festered in the country, Leland and Jane Stanford did what they could to protect their Chinese employees from outside intimidation and harassment. They even leased some of their land to workers like Jim Mok, who used it to cultivate and sell chrysanthemums to students to earn a bit of extra income. For the Big Game of 1895, a profusion of “football mums” colored the stands. Stanford students wore large, festive chrysanthemums in red hues pinned to their jackets, while Cal students wore yellow ones, creating a tradition that endured for decades to come.11 Since its early days, Stanford University hasadmittedJapaneseandChinesestudents. But this admission was often met with overt racism, reminding us that entrance to an elite institution does not equate to inclusion. When a Chinese freshman attempted to move into the dorms at Encina Hall in 1918, he wasbodily thrown outby white students. The outraged Chinese community rallied to fund the construction of aclubhouse on campus, where Chinese students could live while studying at Stanford. Chinese students and members of the Chinese business community worked together to buy a house on campus and rebuild it. Originally located on Salvatierra, where the Stanford Law School stands today, the Chinese Clubhouse was torn down in 1971 to make way for more University construction. Just as much of Asian American history has been papered over, the community’s tangible heritage on campus was demolished. As Asian American alumni, we look upon Stanford with great affection; yet we must also recall the challenges and injustices the AAPI community has overcome to be part of the University. Recognizing past wrongs, while uncovering and celebrating powerful stories of resilience, is not an indictment of our alma mater. Rather, it is a long-overdue reckoning — and an opportunity to initiate healing and forge a stronger sense of collective history. One welcome step would be the installation of a sign on campus to commemorate this history and ensure that it is readily accessible to students, alumni and visitors. Crucially, we believe that any act commemorating the Chinese in America is also necessarily an act of reconciliation. Thus,the process undertakenis just as important as the end result. This process should be founded on meaningful consultation and active participation of the community being represented. We ask the University to engage with our community and empower us to be co-authors of our own story. Such an approach represents best practices fornational parks,historical landmarksandmuseumsacross the country and embraces the ethos:Nothing about us, without us. Stanford administrators can take inspiration from numerous past initiatives honoring Chinese American workers: the Chinese Historical Society of America’s plaquecommemoratingtheir critical contribution to the first transcontinental railroad;other markershonoring the Chinese around North America, with text crafted by our communities in both English andTraditional Chinese; or Stanford’s ownMarket Street Chinatown Archaeological Projectin San Jose, led by Archaeology Center Director Barbara Voss. Community leadership made these efforts resonate all the more. Stanford may be a private institution, but its history constitutes a public legacy. If justice, equity, diversity and inclusion trulymatter to Stanford, as Provost Persis Drell asserts, then the University must strive to genuinely engage with the Chinese American community in bringing this history to light. We urge University leaders to prioritize inclusion and to co-create with communities of color. Avoid tokenistic engagement that does not truly involve communities on matters important to them. Partner with civic groups to develop these narratives into innovative heritage experiences. Through collaboration, the possibilities are boundless.

crimson_2022_73,"I stepped onto Harvard’s campus as a first-year last semester on the backs of greats. I entered Harvard revering the legacies of scholars like W.E.B DuBois, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, and Cornel West, just to name a few, but that wasn’t the selling point for me. It wasn’t until I found out that one of my favorite scholars, Fred Moten, attended Harvard as an undergraduate that I really felt secure in my decision. Now, as I have made it through my first semester at Harvard, none of their legacies bring me ease or satisfaction. The more I learn about Harvard, the more I realize that every student — past, present, and future — enters Harvard on the backs of slaves. Slaves who served as janitors, as kitchen maids, and as personal servants for the University and its students. Even University administrators and professors owned slaves, all of which has been documented in apublicationabout the legacy of slavery at Harvard. As Frank Wilderson says, “Where there are Slaves it is unethical to be free.” No institution has been untouched by slavery and anti-Blackness in the U.S., and like anti-Blackness, Harvard also precedes the founding of the United States. Harvard was the first institution of higher learning in what is now known as the U.S., and because of this Harvard has played a large role in higher education in America. However, this influence has a dark side, as many of Harvard’s benefactors, students, and faculty were deeply involved in the slave trade. While Harvard carves out spaces for Black scholarship through its African and African American Studies Department and itsLegacy of Slavery Research Grants, its legacy of slavery continues to extend into the present. Harvard currently invests inprisons, refuses to give backphotographsof slaves to their descendants, and disposseses indigenous populations worldwide by purchasing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of land in Brazil, Africa, and the United States. We also can see with the refusals of tenure for ProfessorsLorgia García PeñaandCornel Westthat Harvard’s legacy of slavery affects the present, as Black people are still seen as disposable and fungible by the University. This illuminates why it is impossible to see the legacy of Harvard as extricable from slavery. Slavery has always been and always will be a part of Harvard, and acknowledging this legacy brings up an ethical dilemma that calls into question the legitimacy of Harvard all together. If Harvard — or any colonial institution — wanted to truly address the harms that they have perpetrated over the past 500 plus years, all they would have to do is “Return Turtle Island to the ‘Savage.’ Repair the demolished subjectivity of the Slave,” as Wilderson writes in his book Red, White, and Black. Harvard claims to want to address its legacy of slavery, but instead they use their money and resources to fight a court battle whereTamara Lanieris trying to get her ancestor’s daguerreotypes back from the University. And yes, Harvard gives $1500 grants to students to research about Harvard’s connection to slavery, but at the bare minimum that should be coupled with a pledge to give reparations to the descendants of slaves that were owned by the University, administrators, professors, or anyone else that worked or studied at Harvard. A commitment to addressing the harms of slavery is a commitment to addressing the harms of anti-Blackness. There is no way to address the effects and legacies of slavery without addressing how slavery still seeps into our everyday lives, from our political institutions to even the ways that we study, learn, and interact with knowledge — especially at Harvard. If Harvard truly wanted to address its continuing legacy of slavery, Harvard’s educational practices, their investment strategies, and overall ways of existing as a University would be different. If Harvard truly rectified its harms of slavery, Harvard as we know it today would not exist. Christian A. Gines ‘25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Massachusetts Hall.

thetech_mit_2022_7,"These remarks were originally prepared forMIT s 48th Annual Martin Luther King Celebration Luncheonheld on Feb. 10, 2022. I Love MIT. Those are three words that I would usuallyneverstring together into a sentence. Yet, at this moment, I find myself at the two-and-a-half year mark of dedicating my labor to MIT as the former president of the Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA and as a student representative on not one but two different institute committees working on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI and public safety, respectively. I’ve organized events on these topics. I’ve been in dozens of meetings with President Reif, Institute Community Equity Officer John Dozier, Chancellor Nobles, and others whom I all respect. In reflecting on the theme for this event, I honed in on the words “truth” and “love.” I found quotes from the late feminist author bell hooks that read, “The heart of justice is truth-telling,” and “There can be no love without justice.” She uses a definition of Love from M. Scott Peck: “the will to extend one’s self for the purpose of nurturing one’s own or another’s spiritual growth.” With these definitions in mind, I was forced to admit that through these labors, Iamcommitted to the spiritual,andmoral,andethical growth of MIT. And thus Ido, in fact, Love MIT. It’s an agape love, an ongoing, unconditional concern for the well-being of MIT, the community inside it, and those it impacts. Ruminating further on “truth” and “love,” I came to the conclusion that to Love well, we must be willing to tell the truth. MIT’s own value statement writes that we must be willing to “speak plainly about failings in our systems.” So, it is in this spirit that I convey three inconvenient truths about the chasm between Martin Luther King Jr.’s values and MIT’s actions. Truth number one: The truth is MIT is an institute of higher learning and a global leader in research with a well-intentioned community, BUT, quoting MIT professor Ed Bertschinger (who was the first institute community equity officer , MIT is also comprised of a board of trustees known as “The Corporation” with its own agenda and internal politics that resists any change that would redress severe power imbalances. In my experiences working with senior administration, I’ve often been one of less than a handful of students on 25–30 person committees, despite students making up nearly half of the MIT population. My peers and I have fought for increased decision-making power as committee co-chairs, but even in the case where we do have a student as a co-chair, we are not privy to relevant documents nor do we have decision-making power or influence on meeting times. Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed of an integration that was not merely a “romantic mixing of colors” but a “real sharing of power and responsibility.” At MIT, we aren’t sharing nearly enough power or responsibility. Truth number two: The truth is MIT released its boldest Climate Action Plan in 2021, BUT it is still a shareholder in fossil fuels that continue to produce climate change impacts disproportionately affecting Black, brown and indigenous people. I’m Nigerian by heritage. Since 2010, the Shell oil company, which MIT has received donations from, has leaked over 17.5 million liters of oil into the Niger Delta region, where my mother grew up — that’s roughly seven Olympic-size swimming pools of oil. This is personal, and this is just a snapshot of the global devastation caused by fossil fuels. How can MIT hope to achieve its mission to “make a better world” while actively engaging with companies that poison the water and land in communities all over the world? This is an overt complicity in unbridled capitalism, which King despised and believed has “outlived its usefulness.” Truth number three: The truth is MIT does have a model of working with graduate students that has produced some positive change, BUT this model often moves at a snail s pace to accommodate those with the most privilege or ignores inconvenient truths and inconvenient recommendations. I’ll offer the example of the yet-to-be-completed five year Strategic Action Plan to address DEI for the years 2021–2026. Wait … isn’t it 2022? The pace of change and mistreatment student leaders have experienced using existing MIT models have left over 2500 grad workers with the conviction that we need a graduate student union to secure legally-binding, lasting change. On Feb. 1, the chancellor and provost sent out an email communicating MIT’s stance, that they believe “MIT’s long-standing partnership with graduate students is a better path forward than unionization.” To that, I will paraphrase King, who was enthusiastically pro-union. In fact, he was assassinated at a labor union-organizing campaign. He says “our needs are identical with labor’s needs. That is why the labor-baiter is virtually always a twin-headed creature spewing anti-Negro epithets from one mouth and anti-labor propaganda from the other mouth.” As anti-negro epithets may not be as common today, I’ll summarize the core of King’s stance in a different way — rhetoric that is not enthusiastically pro-labor union cannot be enthusiastically anti-racist. These three truths may seem unrelated, but they are all connected through issues of capital and hierarchy. The truth is, the bottleneck to progress at MIT is not a lack of knowledge or resources; it is an administration infatuated with wealth and intoxicated by power. It’s an aversion to truth-telling, and a scarcity of agape love; it’s power without love, which, in King’s words, is “reckless and abusive.” I Love MIT. Those are three words that I would usually never string together into a sentence. But, Iamcommitted to the spiritual,andmoral,andethical growth of MIT. I’m practicing my love by telling these inconvenient truths. If you Love MIT too, to Love well, we must be willing to tell the truth, then take palpable measures to bend the arc of MIT’s history towards justice.

state_press_2022_15,"For a young person who may be balancing personal needs, academics and work, an unplanned pregnancy would have an immense impact on their life. On March 30, Gov. Doug Ducey signed a 15-week abortion ban into law, alongside a plethora of other bills attacking bodily autonomy. Not only will the new law harm people seeking abortions, but it threatens current and future health care workers as well. Senate Bill 1164, sponsored by Sen. Nancy Barto, R-Phoenix, mimics a piece of legislation from Mississippi by outlawing abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest. Asubstantial percentageof abortion patients are college-aged young people, meaning the law will directly impact students in Arizona. For a young person who may be balancing personal needs, academics and work, an unplanned pregnancy would have an immense impact on their life. Making the choice to have an abortion is deeply personal to each individual. Their doctors are meant to be sources of expertise and advice. Lawmakers are forcing themselves into the conversation and dehumanizing people in that personal process. In addition to harming people seeking abortions, the law will restrict the ability of doctors to make informed decisions with patients. Knowingly performing an abortion for a patient past the 15-week mark would have physicians facing a class six felony charge, as well as having their license to practice revoked or suspended, according to the bill. This is a matter for the patient to decide upon with the guidance of a team of trusted medical professionals and allies, not lawmakers acting in their own self-interest, said Sarah Mathias, an outreach intern for theWomen s Coalitionand junior studying biological sciences. As a prospective health care professional, I would not feel comfortable or safe working in Arizona knowing that there are lawmakers who believe imprisonment for providing abortion or gender-affirming treatment is justified, Mathias said. For students on a pre-med track and planning to work in health care, laws like these, which criminalize the responsibilities inherent to their future careers, will create dangerous working conditions. Health care workers should be able to feel safe and supported while caring for people. They shouldn t be targets for performing procedures that their patients feel is best for their bodies. Arizona already has a serious OB-GYN shortage because of attacks like these and the passing of these bills will further criminalize the doctor-patient relationship, said Rebecca Kittridge, a member ofPlanned Parenthood Generation Action at ASUand junior studying psychology and justice studies. These shortages and a lack ofwidespread residency positionsin Arizona might have already been factors preventing students from wanting to stay in the state for medical school and their careers. If this wasn’t enough, the fact that providing a specific type of care to a patient could cause them to lose their license or even be imprisoned will definitely push many to study and work elsewhere. Personal liberties are being thrown out the window, Kittridge said. This is going to affect people at all levels. With many students already struggling to make ends meet, few would be able to afford the time and costs of traveling to receive care. It s possible that few doctors would want to risk their livelihoods by providing abortion care in spite of the law. By taking away their options, Ducey and the Arizona Legislature are robbing people of the future they may want for themselves. Make no mistake — the legislators who voted in favor of this law in the House and Senate will not stop at a 15-week ban. They will continue to chip away at abortion care until abortion is illegal in Arizona. #1164#azlegpic.twitter.com/qoFXcZR9sv Abortion is always going to happen. The question is just whether it is going to be safe and whether only wealthy, white women will have access to reproductive healthcare because they can afford to travel out of state to get an abortion if they need it, Kittridge said. As this dangerous bill becomes law, we must take every opportunity to support and protect peoples rights to make decisions about their own bodies.

crimson_2022_160,"In 2007, Harvard professor Peter L. Galisonwroteof Allston dreams and Allston nightmares. At that time, just after the University had announced ambitious plans to expand its presence in Allston, Professor Galison’s piece was an argument for smart design: for a space that would bring together Harvard’s best scientists and humanists and that people would not want to leave as soon as the day was out. For, in other words, creating an Allston that would be a “fundamental piece of the dynamic center of Harvard University.” Maybe Professor Galison got his dream. The SEC is an imperious, environmentally-friendly, mixed-use fortress for STEM. The neighboring Enterprise Research Campus will provide the restaurants, storefronts, and amenities of a vibrant, walkable urban center. For Harvard, this is a triumph, the summit of a climb decades in the making. But with each angular, glistening building, Allston has become less a home for Allstonians and more a sandbox for Harvard’s billion-dollar dreams. Housing costs have risen. Streets have grown more congested. Locals have been pushed out. As Harvard has built its dreams, too many Allstonians have lived nightmares. From 2011 to 2019, the average price of a home in Allston rose by 43 percent, average rent jumped by 36 percent, and, in the biggest change of all, median household income increased by 67 percent. Theoretically, this increase in median household income could just reflect an influx of wealthier people. However, Censusdataindicate that the population of Allston not living in group quarters (i.e. non-college-students has hardly grown since 2010. This is almost certainly not a story of a few well-monied professors and graduate students moving across the river to join the long-time residents of Allston. Common sense cautions that it almost certainly isn’t a story about thousands of low-income people miraculously doubling their income in just eight years, either. This is a story about Allstonians being pushed out. Like almost all American housing crises,supply is the issue. When high-demand areas like Allston don’t have enough places for people to live, available residences are subject to vicious bidding wars. In Allston, this has had profound consequences. Areportby the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation, a housing non-profit, found that “rising rents have led to closing doors for renters, homeowners and homebuyers.” In aninterview with The Crimson, Anthony P. D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civic Association, described watching “absolutely absurdly ridiculous” price conditions displace locals from his hometown. This all traces back to Harvard. Harvard owns 360 acres of land in the neighborhood —about a thirdof Allston’s total landmass. These properties, which include athletics facilities, the Business School, and the SEC, serve predominantly Harvard affiliates while effectively foreclosing huge swathes of Allston to residential development. Consequently, as the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation put it, “the lack of vacant land in Allston Brighton makes it nearly impossible to increase the affordable housing stock significantly.” There are some notable exceptions, sure. Harvard has announced plans to construct around a thousand residential units across roughly 20 acres of land. It has donated $25 million to support housing affordability in Allston (though this financial support might not be needed if Harvardwere required to pay its fair share of taxes . But, as soaring prices in the area demonstrate, neither 20 acres nor $25 million can fill a 360-acre void. No neighborhood can remain livable when almost a third of its land is totally off limits. The responsibility for the Allston housing crisis is unambiguously Harvard’s, and it should make anyone who proclaims to care about justice absolutely furious. There is no way to overstate how much housing crises harm people. Nothing decides the course of your life like where you grow up. Housing determines the air you breathe, the food you eat, the schools you attend, the people you know, the crimes you suffer. Where you begin your life, in a greater sense, decides where you will end it. In this respect, the experience of housing crises across the country makes abundantly clear how Harvard’s Allston adventurism can hurt people — it has the power to make thempoorer,sicker, moreisolated, moreunhappy, and, in the worst cases,homeless. It cankill. In light of all of this, unless Harvard expands tenfold its material commitment to replacing the housing it has robbed from Allston, there is unequivocally one just answer to this abject failure: Stop building in Allston. Sell the unused land. Clear the way for developers to build housing on it. It saddens me that, withthis most recent staff editorial, the Editorial Board has failed to see that — an especially ironic failing given our not-so-distantprecedenton UC Berkeley’s housing shortfall, in which we called on the university to build more housing because of the “particular value of access to education.” For this Board to recognize the imperative of housing formostly well-offstudents at elite colleges but not low-income people in our own community is, at best, woefully inconsistent. But this Board is not alone, and this misstep is no unique moral or intellectual failing. In this nation,the housing crisis rages onbecause we fail to imagine something better — to consider an alternative to uninspired and unwelcoming low-density sprawl. At Harvard, that means finding innovative new ways to increase density: Building up, down, sideways, every which way but out. Professor Galison’s call for a shining new frontier of campus just across the Charles ended with a reminder that “times have changed” — that we can reimagine what our University is. Today, 15 years later, it is precisely because times have changed in Allston that I call on us to reimagine how we approach Allston yet again. Harvard’s dreams and Allston’s nightmares are one and the same. It’s time for both to end. Tommy Barone ’25, an Associate Editorial Editor, lives in Currier House."
thetech_mit_2022_40,"If you ever find yourself in an MIT Admissions information session, the last slide will have three phrases on it: Need Based, Need Blind, and Full Need. This is MIT’s financial commitment to its students: (1 there are no merit-based scholarships, so all financial aid is only based on need; (2 undergraduate admissions does not take financial need into account while reviewing applications; and (3 MIT will meet 100% of demonstrated need. I wish I could tell you this was true, and it may well be for most students. The phrases sure are catchy. I. Need Based According to theMIT Student Financial Services (SFS Financial Aid Glossary, need based “means that we award financial aid entirely based on your family’s financial circumstances.” Need based should mean that when assigning financial aid awards, SFS gives you aid based on how much you need it, you being an individual MIT student whose name shows up on MITPay. You may pay yourself or your parents may pay for everything, but ultimately, the check is under your name. Simple enough, right? SFS, however, determines your award based on yourfamily’sability to pay, regardless of their intent to contribute or your access to their funds. It raises the question: who counts as family? When I first opened the aid application my senior spring of high school, giddy about my magical college future, one question took me by surprise. Do you have a non-custodial parent? I do. My biological mother gave up physical custody of both my brother and me when my dad filed for divorce. I was two years old at the time. It isn’t “normal” for parents to give up custody of their kids — in the sense of the idyllic American nuclear family with 2.2 kids playing behind a white picket fence. In fact, the California standard is a 50/50 time and responsibility split between parents. Given the abnormality of my family situation, it is reasonable that there should be special accommodations in the financial aid application process. For the sake of privacy, let’s call this woman who gave birth to me Leanne. I will never know exactly why she decided to give up custody. Maybe she knew in her heart that she’d never wanted children, and it was my dad’s life calling to be a good father. Maybe she justified it because he made more money than her. Maybe she was scared that she couldn’t be there for me if something went wrong. Regardless, I didn’t know about the legal arrangement for most of my childhood because we all did our best to play the roles expected of a reasonable split family. For 11 years, until I was in the eighth grade, my parents shuttled me back and forth between their houses like a “typical” child of divorce. There were “Mommy Mondays” — dinner with Leanne and then back to Dad’s yellow house in Berkeley before bed. Every other weekend, my biological mother would pick up me and my brother in her Subaru Outback and take us to her place in whichever suburb or smaller town she moved to last. There were at least six different apartments or homes in those 11 years. I didn’t find out about the custody arrangement — that I wasn’t required to live at her house — until my last year of middle school, when we became estranged. Or, to put it in a less passive way, I decided never to speak to her again. Only then did my dad and step-mom, who I call my mom, realize it was important for me to know that I wasn’t actually required to live with Leanne. I still haven’t spoken to her, not for all of high school or college, even now in my senior year.The only intentional contact I’ve been forced to initiate was through the MIT financial aid process. See, MIT requires noncustodial parents to submit their financial aid information through theCollege Scholarship Service (CSS Profile, a College Board form designed to consolidate tax documents and income declarations. The wrinkle is, Leanne is contributing a whopping $0 to my education. She is paying nothing toward my housing nor food. No child support. Nada. I wouldn’t want it any other way, given my desire to not have any association with her. If she is not paying anything toward my education, I have no contact with her, and she does not have custody over me or claim me as a dependent, then why is her information necessary to determine my financial need? MIT and its peer institutions have varying ways of approaching noncustodial parents in their informational material. Brown University, for instance, says that should parents “discontinue their financial support for reasons other than ability to pay,Brown will not assume the parental responsibility for financial support of the student.” Essentially, though universities arein loco parentisin the eyes of the law, Brown would not want to be my mommy. Or make up for her mistakes, I suppose. They’re saying that the student’s actual ability to pay is not their concern. The reality of that student’s access to financial resources does not matter, as if legal definitions of parents on birth certificates are the same as cash in hand.MIT is not so explicitin its dismissal of students in this circumstance, instead giving the tame, even amiable, reassurance that if “you have trouble submitting financial information because of a previous or ongoing separation or divorce please contact us, we can help. We may be able to waive the need for financial information from your noncustodial parent.” Seems fair enough, but what are the requirements for such a waiver? What counts as “trouble submitting”? MIT’s website directs you to theCSS Profile Waiver Request form, which says that an exemption may be made with: Documented abuse situations involving you and your noncustodial parent. Legal orders that limit the noncustodial parent s contact with you. No contact or support ever received from the noncustodial parent. Reading these requirements for the first time flashed a memory behind my eyes of standing in a prim cardigan in front of a judge as a pre-teen, trying to avoid eye contact with the woman spilling lies about our relationship. This never actually happened to me, though I thought about it plenty. Leanne threatened to take me and my parents to court when I initiated the estrangement, but I got us out of it by attending one tear-stained family therapy session. Leanne sat unmoved when I said I felt like she was stalking me by showing up on my dad’s front porch after I said I didn’t want to see her anymore. But that doesn’t fall into the neat financial aid form bucket. I couldn’t meet the other conditions either. Without the“court documents,” “legal orders,” or “third-party documentation,”required for a waiver, I was screwed. This boilerplate form and its strict, institutional requirements were not reflective of the messy, complicated needs inherent to the type of family where a noncustodial parent exists in the first place. Shaken by the strict, official language of the form, my dad and I decided to try to get Leanne to submit her financial documents rather than file a waiver. After I entered her email into the College Board website, it automatically sent her a request to fill out the forms. She wrote directly to me, despite my repeated pleas throughout the years for her not to do so: “Now that you have had a few years to learn more about how to be kind to people and respect their feelings, I am sure you will understand why someone who has been repeatedly rejected might not want to do a favor for you. It is up to you to remedy the situation you created.” The act of reaching out, even for a few financial documents, opened the door for guilt-tripping. Leanne has a pattern of financial manipulation, withholding funds in exchange for attention. The same thing happened a few months before the estrangement, when Leanne told me — then 13 years old, remember — she was moving all of my brother’s college savings to my account because he didn’t spend enough time with her. Right after I broke off contact, she transferred the contents of my savings account to her personal coffers as punishment for leaving. Writing this essay, I feel a pit in my chest just rereading those words, though the threat is long since passed. Could the powers-that-be behind the financial aid system not have anticipated that forcing interaction with noncustodial parents might create channels for harmful family members to sneak back into their children’s lives? Luckily, my father took on the bulk of the responsibility for the situation, despite his own hesitance to interact with a woman he divorced for a reason. I found an email from my dad to Leanne on Nov. 27, 2017, which reads, “Annie forwarded us your email trying to pressure her into family therapy as a condition of completing financial aid forms for her college applications. Annie has no desire to engage in family therapy. I hope you will reconsider and complete the forms — it will make everything much simpler. This kind of attempt at pressure is no way to repair a relationship, if that is what you are trying to achieve.” Leanne did eventually fill out the forms that year. Her third income beyond that of the parents I live with artificially deflated the financial need on my application, but I still received aid that year. The key point here is that for all the pain of reopening contact, the system set me up to receive less aid without regard to Leanne’s lack of expected financial contribution. SFS took my “family’s financial circumstances” into account, but their broad definition of family included a woman who is more of an angry ghost than a functioning parent. I’m sure it didn’t hurt that this choice was better for the university’s bottom line. II. Need Blind The SFS Financial Aid Glossary states that prospective students“are not disadvantaged in the undergraduate admissions process because of their financial need. We are one of only six schools in the U.S. that is need blind and meets full need for all students, foreign and domestic.” My financial situation did not affect my acceptance to MIT. The admissions office fulfilled its promise of keeping my finances separate from the application reading process. Yet, SFS itself was blind to my need for guidance, compassion, and understanding as the child of a noncustodial parent. What they saw:discrepancies between numbers on files and missing or blurry documents. What they asked for:my father and I to get back in touch with Leanne over and over and over again to correct the mistakes. What they didn’t see:me tearing up and trying not to let my dad hear it in my voice when I told him on the phone that, yet again, for the third time, we’d have to go back and ask her for a correction. SFS didn’t see that we couldn’t figure out how to hide my email address from Leanne on the College Board website, so she tried to reach out to me each time the web portal alerted her it was that time of year again. I set up an inbox filter that automatically deleted any messages from the three email accounts she set up. SFS didn’t see the cards she sent to my dorm address, which no one in my family would have told her, as if to say that she could always find out where I lived. Was that address on the financial aid forms? I don’t know. Other schools promise to avoid this situation. The California Institute of Technology writes ontheir websitethat in cases of divorce, “personal information, such as contact information and Social Security numbers, will… not be shared with the other parent.” SFS should ensure that all financial aid systems they use are set up to fulfill this promise. Sensitive information should be kept confidential not just between divorced parents, but also between parent and student when applicable. Making oneself vulnerable to stalking should not be a condition to apply for aid. SFS didn’t see any of this because they did not establish any familiarity with my family’s situation. We were left blind to their inner workings because the office was opaque to us. Faceless, nameless, uncontactable. Each time reaching out was a test of will power. When we called my assigned financial aid counselor my first year, he didn’t pick up or return my dad’s voicemail. The following years were smooth enough. Senior year was a disaster. Over the course of four months, my father and I suffered through convoluted, misinformed, and unhelpful email chains with a string of financial aid officers. The following section details these exchanges, though the specificity is provided as evidence, not entertainment. It began with a form email that said, “We are writing to let you know that your financial aid application for the 2021–2022 academic year is incomplete.” The email didn’t include the actual problem but instead provided a link to an application portal. The first time, the portal told me a form was missing from my noncustodial parent. I looked on the College Board website, saw that it was already submitted, and emailed SFS with a screenshot of the page saying the document was uploaded. SFS responded with a form email saying they’d reply shortly. A day and a half later, they told me the document was unreadable, and Leanne would need to resubmit it. I wrote to my dad with an apology, asking if he could reach out to her again. Each time I had to ask him to reinitiate contact, I felt the thud of guilt in my stomach. An entire month and a half later, I got another form email from SFS saying something was wrong with the application. This time, the portal simply said there was an unspecified discrepancy in my application, and I’d have to contact them for information. I reached out. Four days later, SFS replied that my step-father’s information was left off of the application. I don’t have a step-father. My first instinct was to wonder whether SFS was seriously the one telling me my biological mother had remarried. If that was the case, I didn’t want to know, and why would his information even be necessary for my application? After another back-and-forth, SFS clarified that it was my step-mother’s information that was needed, and I notified them that I submitted it. At least this wasn’t really a discretion of personal details about Leanne’s life. Three weeks later, I wrote again to SFS saying that I had still not received aid, though it was months after the expected release date. Once again, they replied that my step-parent was left off of my forms. I directed them to look back in our email thread to see that I had already fixed the issue. Eleven days later, I emailed them again asking for a response about whether the issue was fixed. A different financial aid officer, one not assigned to me, replied that two of my non-custodial parent’s forms were now missing. I sent back screenshots showing the documents were uploaded months ago. SFS replied that the documents had a discrepancy, not that they were missing after all. The fact that they could confuse the two in an email to me suggests that they were scarcely glancing at my files. My father replied, “Annie is estranged from her noncustodial parent…It is extremely difficult for Annie to communicate with her and just getting to this level of documentation has been a major effort.” He inquired whether they could continue the calculations despite the discrepancy given our unique situation and suggested that they call him if there was a problem. A third financial aid officer replied, without explaining why the name behind the email kept changing, that this wasn’t possible. The officer continued, “Now, I can tell you that just looking at the numbers that came through without having been reviewed, it looks like Annie may qualify for some MIT Scholarship aid this year, though likely not much…So it s up to you if you want to continue with the application process, or if you want to just have us review Annie s FAFSA so we can work with you on loan eligibility.” This chain of emails shows a lack of attention to detail, failure to follow up, and discontinuity between people administering support. The final email makes me the angriest. The financial aid officer essentially said,if it’s so difficult for you, maybe you shouldn’t apply for aid at all.The numbers would be small, in part because of that third income on the application from Leanne, so apparently my family’s financial need wasn’t worth the effort. It was too complicated for an office at a school whose motto ismens et manus, “mind and hand.” Our university’s mission includes a shared commitment to practical problem solving based on critical thinking, so all offices on campus should strive to meet that ideal. When my situation didn’t fit the neat institutional boxes, that should have provided an interesting challenge to overcome for employees whose work must often seem tedious. Of more importance is that it was a challenge involving complex family dynamics, not just numbers and dollar signs. Real people were involved and experiencing pain at each step of the process. When we see people in difficult situations, the instinct should be to reach out, clarify the problem, and provide whatever help is possible. In the four years since I first applied for aid, I never heard a voice or made eye contact with a financial aid officer. What impact does it have on students to explain their stories again and again to a faceless email address hiding a rotating cast of financial aid officers? I have no idea how many people read my emails. Did I owe them my story? Imagine if it had been different. Imagine if when I first presented the difficulty of reaching out to a noncustodial parent, SFS responded with compassion and a phone call. Imagine if they provided all of the relevant information to resolve the problems with my application from the outset, so the process didn’t stretch over months. Imagine if I hadn’t been required to reach out to Leanne in the first place. While little scholarly literature addresses the question of noncustodial parents and college financial aid, Ohio State University professor Kaprea Johnson advises college counselors to consider “the time since (or if there was contact between the student and parent; if a parent has a history of mental illness, drug or alcohol abuse, or incarceration; or if the whereabouts of the parent are unknown.” 1 MIT makes the first step toward this with the College Board waiver form, but that document does not include directions for students who have had contact in the past, but not in a long time (eight years now in my case, greater than a third of my lifetime . It also establishes the high barrier of legal documentation and third-party documentation for proof of hardship. Johnson’s article continues that universities should recognize that noncustodial parents may not be willing to pay toward their child’s education “despite the institution s assumption that he or she will.” The whole financial aid system is built on this assumption, based on out-dated ideas that an American family includes two parents who feel responsibility to provide for their children. If SFS’s goal and mandate is to ensure that cost of attendance will never be a barrier for a qualified student to study at MIT, it is senseless to exclude those students who must take greater personal responsibility for paying for college through no fault of their own. Furthermore, Johnson recommends that financial aid officers refer students in complex familial situations to mental health services on campus. When knots of stress took over my shoulders and I felt like other MIT students could never understand this situation, a direct referral to MIT Mental Health and Counseling to coach me through the application process would have been invaluable. Recently, I walked into the SFS office to pick up a COVID-19 federal relief check. I asked the receptionist if there was a way to provide feedback to her office. She looked confused, so I rephrased the question. “Not that I know of,” she replied. “You can always email us.” This solidified my suspicions. SFS does not reallyseestudents, nor do they want to. III. Full Need The SFS Financial Aid Glossary states that full need “means that we meet 100% of your family’s demonstrated need through scholarships, grants, and student employment.” Now, here comes the big reveal:I’m not on financial aid. I have federal work study designation, but no scholarships or grants for me this year. My family decided to withdraw our application. Instead of getting an MIT scholarship, we took out tens of thousands of dollars of loans under my name. Because I come from a financially stable background, I trust that they will be paid off. Or rather, my dad will pay them off. I already paid over $30,000 toward my education and college expenses by choosing cheaper lifestyle options (no meal plans and contributing earnings from campus jobs and internships. I’m graduating in seven semesters instead of the typical eight to save money. MIT made the same promise to me as it did to all other undergraduates:need based, need blind, full need. They didn’t deliver. I will be fine. My parents will be fine. But what about the students in my situation who are also reliving childhood trauma each time they are required to get back in touch with absent, neglectful, or abusive noncustodial parents? What if those students can’t afford to give up? Does SFS believe that those students are deserving of aid? Regardless of my own financial situation, did my dad and I have to go through this bureaucratic downpour just to satisfy inane application requirements? I’m writing this because I don’t let this story out often. I’m writing this because I’m angry. I’m writing this because I am tired and graduating, and I love MIT too much to not work out our issues. I’m writing this because I can’t let it happen to someone else. So what happens next? To my fellow students reading this essay, I ask that you refrain from making assumptions about your classmates’ financial situations, even when you find out their financial aid status. I can’t be the only one here navigating a relationship (or lack thereof with a coercive family member, while taking on personal financial responsibility. The greater agents in this story, however, are the administrators with the power to change MIT SFS. To them, I ask that SFS streamline their communication and recordkeeping process to prevent the misinformed volleys of questions and half-answers that characterized my email exchanges with them. They should rewrite the language around noncustodial parents to encourage students with unusual situations that don’t include court documents to talk through their options with a financial aid officer. In fact, maybe they shouldn’t make students prove their trauma with court documents to begin with. And they should also pick up the phone and respond promptly when you do call. In addition, MIT should fund research on the experiences of students with noncustodial parents and how it affected their ability to pay for college. How many students did not apply or withdrew their applications because the burden of obtaining information from their noncustodial parent was too much or even compromised their safety? How many fewer families would be burdened with college debt if extra documents were not required in cases where there is no contact between student and noncustodial parent? MIT SFS should then change their policies accordingly and encourage their peer institutions to do the same. Only then can their promise of need based, need blind, and full need be more than a marketing slogan.

crimson_2022_65,"When I was in middle school, my history teacher taught my class about “the shot heard round the world”: the first gunshot fired by a soldier at the Battle of Lexington and Concord on April 18, 1775. This marked the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, a rebellion that would inspire other nations for decades to come. As a child, I was fascinated by this idea that the entire world could feel the impact of a single person’s actions. Eventually, I would come to learn that this was not the only time that the world had come to a halt — nor would it be the last. At least once in our lifetimes, we all hear another shot — a tragedy that stops the world. In that moment, time freezes. For my father, it was the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. For my mother, it was the murder of John Lennon. For me, it was the murder of George Floyd. In the summer of 2020, George Floyd waseverywhere: my Instagram timeline, my Twitter feed, my television screen. Everywhere I looked I was reminded that, much likeEric Garner, a police officer choked George Floyd until he could no longer breathe — all because his Blackness was seen as a weapon. We live in a world where Black people have to hold their breath and fear for their lives when they spot flashing lights of red and blue in their rearview mirror. A world where a police officer gets to decide whether a Black man deserves to breathe. While George Floyd was not the first Black man to die while in police custody, his death prompted more public outrage than I had ever seen. Protesters took to the streets demanding that justice be served and change be made. I watched the world stop as it cried for George Floyd, recognizing a reality that I had known for years: our country was flawed and our system was broken. The murder of George Floyd was a wakeup call to the American public and my generation. A magnifying glass that exposed the cracks in our system to the untrained eye. But these issues are not new. We were not the first generation to take to the streets to fight back against this unjust system. Nor were we the first generation to look at the world around us and shudder at the horrors we saw. This fight began years ago, with our mothers and our fathers. With our aunts and uncles. With our grandparents and our great-grandparents. My own family’s fight trails all the way back to my great-great-uncle and aunt who marched alongside Dr. King and other Civil Rights leaders in the March on Washington and the Selma to Montgomery March. Yet, here we are, decades later, facing the same problems they faced, fighting the same fights they fought, and marching the same streets they marched. The sound of a gunshot can last three to five milliseconds, and, for a single moment in time, that shot can be heard around the world. While the entire world stops in that moment — stunned silent and recoiling from the impact — it does not take very long for a state of normalcy to return and for everything to be set back into motion. Life goes on for those who do not have to worry about a similar fate. They return to their daily lives until they hear the next shot, moving on without healing the country’s previous wound. As we take time this month to celebrate the beauties of what it means to be Black in America and all of the rich history that comes along with it, we mourn all of the Black lives lost simply because of the melanin that enriches their skin. And so, as we smile, laugh, and cry, we will also wait. Wait for the other shoe to drop. For the next life to be lost. For the next trial to begin. For the next sentencing to occur. For the next shot to be heard around the world. Nicole B. Alexander ’24, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Kirkland House. This piece is a part of a focus on Black authors and experiences for Black History Month."
rice_thresher_2022_61,"ByBria Weisz2/1/22 10:47pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. “You need to make your hair bigger” were the director’s words I overheard upon logging into one of my Zoom rehearsals for the department of visual and dramatic arts’ “New Voices” – a collection of scenes from a variety of shows, performed on Zoom in the middle of the pandemic. The sentence wasn’t spoken to me, but I felt discomfort upon hearing them during this dress rehearsal and at some later rehearsals. One of my peers was playing a Jewish character in a different scene; the student was not ethnically Jewish (and many Jewish people aren’t , but the character is explicitly written as Jewish going back for “generations and generations.” As a result, the director asked this student to alter her appearance to fit the Jewish part. The experience of sitting at my laptop, watching my peer tease her hair so that she could look more like me, the only Jewish girl in the cast, felt ingenuine and even sinister. What struck me as oddest about the situation was that it could have been avoided —the scenes were neither chosen nor cast until months after auditions. Yet there I was, feeling isolated because of a less-than-sensitive directing decision. At the time, I considered saying something to the director or the head of the VADA department, but I was scared to make a fuss over what seemed like an isolated incident. Furthermore, I was getting course credit from being in the play and did not want my grade to be affected. I haven’t acted in a VADA department play since, but my experiences running tech for later shows and participating in college theatre and Rice Players shows has taught me that theatre at Rice must become more inclusive and accessible to students. Through talking with other VADA play participants, I’ve found that some students have the courage to speak up about their concerns to the director. However, the onus should not be on students, many of whom receive course credit for participating in these plays, to speak to their professional directors and professors about their problematic decisions. A student should not have to talk with a director to remove a transphobic joke from the script, as did happen in the spring of 2020. In fact, a script with transphobic jokes in it should not be chosen to begin with. Rice theatre producers, including the VADA department and beyond, have historically chosen plays that do not fit the Rice community well. As a coordinator for the Rice Players, I have helped make play decisions, during which the group wants to prioritize telling stories that represent the Rice community. While that normally manifests in choosing plays with queer themes, we neglect to consider shows that explicitly call for many actors of color. We have discussed concerns over the inability to appropriately cast people in diverse roles, but shying away from those stories creates a cycle in which students of color feel discouraged from auditioning because they do not see roles for them in the shows that we choose. However, I know that Rice has a host of diverse and talented students – I have seen them perform at Dhamaka, the Lunar New Year Festival and even at the low-commitment and student-written shows produced during Play in a Day. Rice theatre producers just need to put in the effort to reach out and encourage them to participate. Nevertheless, even with diverse students interested in participating in theatre, many are unable to because of the time commitment required. Especially for STEM majors, who consistently must take over 15 credit hours each semester, students do not have the time for around 15 hours of rehearsals a week. This problem is exacerbated when poor scheduling results in students spending hours in rehearsal waiting to be needed onstage, as had happened in both the VADA and the Rice Players plays last semester. I remember days when I would have class until 6:30 p.m., rehearsal from 7 p.m. until 10 p.m., and then going back to my dorm to start my homework. I would routinely get four or five hours of sleep each night and fall asleep in my classes because of it. No student, no matter how committed to theatre, should have to sacrifice their physical and academic well-being for an extracurricular. All of these experiences show a need for change within Rice theatre to make plays more accessible to student participation. I harken back to the Rice mantra of “unconventional wisdom” – while theatrical precedent has been set for 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. rehearsals every weekday, nothing is stopping us from experimenting with this format. Theatre groups can commit to producing shows with characters representing our diverse Rice community and getting input from Rice students about what they want to perform in and see onstage. Perhaps VADA can hire someone to sensitivity-check their plays, so no student must be in the uncomfortable situation I was in last year. However, I am only a single participant in the Rice theatre community, and my insights are restricted by my own identity. The Rice Players recently held a Town Hall to discuss diversity and inclusivity in theatre, and a range of experiences and opinions were expressed during that event. It is only with the input of many that we can structurally change Rice theatre into a community that prioritizes everyone’s wellbeing over that of any play. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_137,"To the Classes of 2020 and 2021: When the pandemic was in its early months, we wrote anopen letterto the class of 2020 in which we celebrated your resilience, sadly acknowledged the fact that you would not experience the traditional in-person Commencement rituals you had long anticipated, and put the best face we could on the Zoom and YouTube alternatives we were preparing for you. In that letter, we also all found comfort in what we called the “firm promise” of the University to have you return. The gathering “will be all the sweeter, all the more meaningful,” we promised then, “for having been deferred.” At that time, in our naiveté, none of us expected that not only the class of 2020, but also the class to follow — the class of 2021— would end up having its senior year Commencement experience deferred. And yet, that is what happened. Classes of 2020 and 2021, you together share the distinction of having attended — and graduated from — Harvard College during a historic pandemic. In the coming decades, when you meet for reunions on campus, you all will be the focus of panels and roundtables. Student journalists of the future will seek you out for interviews. They will want to know: What was it like? And you will have such varied stories. Some of your stories may be hard to hear: they will describe experiences of anxiety, illness, grief, and missed opportunities. Some may also carry a tinge of anger, as you describe to these future generations all the things that you think Harvard should have done differently. Other stories will be more philosophical. They will be about the ways in which, even as your on-campus Harvard experience was cut short, your lives expanded in other areas: you deepened relationships with family, you took on responsibility for maintaining a household for the first time, you rethought your priorities and life paths, you discovered new parts of the country and even the world. Still, other stories some of you will tell, especially members of the Class of 2021, will have future generations rapt while you describe what it was like — as vaccines were rolled out but the pandemic persisted — to be invited back to a much-altered campus for your final Spring semester: the peculiarity of attending online classes from your bedrooms, the grab-and-go dining, the thrice-weekly testing, the universal mask-wearing, the experience of a House social life that had now largely pivoted from Zoom to the (often chilly outdoors. In the final weeks of that semester, the Houses invested a lot of effort into figuring out ways to give you all a send-off to remember. On Commencement Day itself, we recognized, toasted, and celebrated you online. But we knew, Class of 2021, that none of it could quite compensate for the disappointment you felt, given the reality that you – like the class before you – would not experience an in-person Commencement. But now both of you are returning! It is finally your moment for gowns, mortarboards, speeches, bagpipers, marching bands, swing bands, last-chance dances, and champagne toasts. Harvard — and all of us — are all dressed up and waiting for you. Welcome back, Classes of 2020 and 2021! The time for our long-awaited reunion is finally here. Anne Harrington is the Chair of the Faculty Deans of Harvard College and the Faculty Dean of Pforzheimer House. This letter was written, reviewed, and submitted by the Faculty Deans of all twelve Houses and the Resident Dean of the Dudley Community."
state_press_2022_42,"Despite coming into politics in a right-leaning battleground state, Arizona Democrats Mark Kelly and Katie Hobbsbeat out their Republican counterparts.Young voters drove home their win. Exit poll data shows that 76% and 71% of voters ages 18-29 voted for Kelly and Hobbs, respectively. Young voters had thesecond-highest midterm turnoutin 30 years, a factor that turned the tide against a predicted red wave. With many brought to the polls with the intention to defend their rights and democracy at large, young Arizonans banded together to vote for progressive policies and candidates. It s clear that young voters are a powerful voter bloc, and it s vital that politicians who hope to win or remain in office in Arizona and around the nation take this demographic seriously. READ MORE:A red tsunami in Arizona was avoided by a strong showing from state Democrats, but Republicans still gained in some races It seems very clear that there were issues emphasized by Democratic candidates that motivated young voters considerably, said Nathan Martin, an associate professor of sociology working at the AZ Youth Identity Project. Both Kelly and Hobbs highlighted progressive agenda items that seemed to resonate with young voters. The issues they care about align more with the Democratic Party, said Nilda Flores-Gonzalez, the associate director and professor at the Sanford School, who co-authored a 2021 study with Martin on what drives young voters to the polls. Young people tend to vote Democrat because they care about climate, individual rights like abortion and care about social issues. Flores-Gonzalez noted that a driver of youth turnout for Arizona Democrats seemed to be pure opposition to Trump and MAGA Republicans. Martin echoed this sentiment. Young people are voting less for the Democrats and more against Trump and Trump-aligned Republicans, he said. Mark Kelly was not going up against a Doug Ducey type of Republican but he was going up against a Trump-picked candidate. This against rather than for mentality is a key characteristic of the young voter demographic that also played a significant role in the2020 presidential election. Neither of the candidates was appealing to young people, Flores-Gonzalez said. What was appealing (to young voters was their values or the social issues they cared about. With anxiety looming about the future of democracy, this explains why Arizona s young voters overwhelmingly voted for candidates like Kelly and Hobbs. Although imperfect, both seemed like better alternatives to right-wing candidates Blake Masters and Kari Lake. Young voters are not enthusiastic about political parties or candidates, Flores-Gonzalez said. But they ll take whoever for them is the lesser of two evils. Whether they were driven to the polls by high-stakes issues like abortion and climate change or not, young voters are redefining their role in politics and showing that they are an essential voter bloc nationwide. Generation Z is really dispelling stereotypes of what it means to be a young person and politically involved, Martin said. They are really becoming a very real political force that is deciding close elections in Arizona and broadly. Arizona s elections have come down to the wire, with Kelly, Hobbs and Secretary of State candidate Adrian Fonteswinning by small margins. However, the bottom line is that young people have shown what we re made of, almost single-handedly turning the red wave blue. It s a sign of the times that a generation criticized for its self-absorption is actually turning out in droves for democracy. Let Arizona s midterm elections stand as a lesson to politicians to take the young vote seriously, or we may just as easily vote them out next term.

thetech_mit_2022_17,"Where we are now: unionization and bargaining Over the past few months, the Graduate Student Union (GSU Bargaining Committee has participated in multiple sessions of contract negotiations with MIT’s administration. In this time, we have worked through our non-economic proposals and the administration s counterproposals on many of the issues afflicting us as graduate student-workers at the Institute. We have made some important steps already through this process to improve our experience as grad workers here. At the same time, the members of the administration are dragging their feet on a number of key demands. Among these demands is a comprehensive non-discrimination clause and a grievance procedure that empowers us grad workers to address harassment and bullying effectively. We must not let them block these crucial demands. MIT’s administration is proposing that our grievance procedure, the provision that gives the whole contract teeth, does not apply to any issue of discrimination, bullying, or harassment, including sexual harassment and assault. They also proposed to remove any commitment to promptness with respect to student disability accommodations, restricting the contract to codifying MIT’s existing accommodation policy. This is common throughout the MIT administration s counterproposals, where we see our strong proposal language undermined and chiseled at, reduced to reiterating current standards and policies full of holes. In cases of discrimination, harassment, and bullying, we are directed to report to the Institute Discrimination and Harrassment Response (IDHR Office instead of using our proposed union grievance procedure. However, in practice, this process has been confusing and difficult for workers to navigate, requiring extensive documentation of the incident and placing the burden on the student-worker to pursue recourse through a frustrating process. It can be an isolating experience, making it easy for workers to become discouraged from speaking out and susceptible to having their issue dismissed. Furthermore, the final judgment for incidents taken through the IDHR process is left up to MIT, with appeals going to the Provost, further reducing the chances of a fair, unbiased judgment. The current process for recourse secures all power in the hands of the administration. We, as student-workers and victims in these situations, deserve a clearly laid out procedure where we are empowered to speak out about our grievances and supported throughout the process to reach a fair resolution. Our current grievance procedure proposal would work as this alternative, allowing us to address any violation of the contractincludingdiscrimination, harrassment, and bullying. Legally protected union stewards would be there to help inform and support student workers throughout the process. And the ability to escalate to neutral arbitration ensures that a fair resolution is met and adequate protections from retaliation. Many who have not navigated this process or spoken to others who have may not see the importance of having this contract language on a personal level. With the challenging process offered by MIT currently through IDHR, many will not feel they can use this process to address issues until they fester and become far more serious and unbearable. With a union grievance procedure, we could address issues long before they become more serious. Addressing the misbehavior and mistreatment our co-workers face will also help to raise the standards for how we can all expect to be treated with respect, dignity, and fairness on the job. Contract proposals advance demands for justice on campus In contracts with graduate student unions, universities have agreed to grievance and arbitration procedures for a number of issues, including changes to wages, work expectations, and workplace safety. For example, ifa lack of safety provisions puts student workers at risk of physical harmand a department or administrators refuse to provide a solution that keeps student-workers safe, the union can take the case to a neutral third-party arbiter to enforce the contract. Yet, many universities such asHarvardhave refused contract provisions that would subject protections against harassment and discrimination to this same enforcement mechanism, despite the fact that such issues are central to workplace safety, particularly for systemically and historically marginalized groups on campus. Over the last several years, student advocacy campaigns on campus have drawn attention to the pervasiveness of racial, sexual, and gender harassment and discrimination at MIT, the dramatic negative impacts that this has on the climate of research and teaching at the Institute, and, especially, the personal health and professional impacts on students. In 2020, theReject Injustice through Student Empowerment (RISE Campaign — a united effort of MIT graduate students led by Graduate Students for a Healthy MIT, Black Graduate Student Association, and Graduate Student Council Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee — called attention to howthe organizational climate and culture at MIT facilitates bias, discrimination, and harassment, linking multiple types of harm together and pressuring MIT administration to reconsider existing workplace practices and norms, including its policies and procedures for handling allegations of misconduct against faculty and staff through the IDHR Office. The RISE Campaign sought to build onthe Black Student Union and Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA ’sSupport Black Lives at MIT petition, which was released in the summer of 2020 and received over 5,000 signatures from members of the campus community. The petition called attention to MIT’s unwillingness to address systemic patterns of racial bias on campus, including fears of discrimination and harassment by MIT Police that are widely shared by members of the Black community on campus. The petition demanded MIT implement accountability and oversight mechanisms for police activity on campus and ultimately alternatives for dispute resolution and public safety. Yet two years later, these demands have largely gone unaddressed.In an op-ed published inThe Techearlier this year, BGSA leadership called for the continuation of this advocacy workand the prioritization of the needs of Black and other historically marginalized students at MIT through the GSU: “Many Black people in this community have been deprived of basic decency and respect at MIT, and we feel the GSU is our best chance of ending a seemingly endless uphill battle against an institution that was not built with us in mind.”A grievance procedure provides another mechanism for identifying allegations of misconduct against faculty and staff, including police. Organizing around and winning acomprehensivegrievance and arbitration procedure through the GSU contract fight is one way to help advance the popularly endorsed demands and important advocacy work of BGSA and the RISE Campaign, as well as a multitude of other committees, working groups, public forums, and petitions through which graduate workers have worked tirelessly for years to address discrimination in academia. Grievance and arbitration would create additional mechanisms by which students could bring forthand bring togetherclaims of identity-based harassment, inform and educate the campus community and the general public about the actual rates of such harms, and seek remedy or restitution outside of upper-level administration. How we win: strength and solidarity Winning our contract with provisions that can build a truly inclusive and just MIT for all students and workers will require demonstrating our strength and solidarity as a collective.In a piece inThe Techfrom this past spring, Kelvin Green detailed historic and current labor movements that offer inspiration on how unions have built solidarity to make real the values that “diversity, equity, and inclusion” espouse not just for their members but for society in general — like the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters or New York University’s graduate workers union. What unites such successful labor-organizing efforts is that they pushed forward strong demands that would improve conditions for everyone in their communities and backed those demands up with inclusive organizing that built solidarity in their movement and with interconnected struggles. Yet, we need not look deep into the past, or even to the recent organizing victories of the Amazon Labor Union, Starbucks Workers United, and others for this inspiration. There is abundant inclusive labor organizing here on MIT’s campus that exemplifies how union organizing builds our collective voices and allows us a path towards better conditions for workers and students on campus and beyond. This includes the MIT Student Worker Alliance, a coalition of MIT undergraduate students, graduate workers, employees, and contract workers across campus, which has come together to push for robust safety protections from COVID-19,inflation relief for employees,organize advocacy for reproductive justice, and more. This alliance is a result of the solidarity across different groups of workers that principled union organizing creates — as MIT graduate student-workers are fighting for our first contract now, facility workers at MIT were engaged in anongoing struggle against pay cuts and for a fair contract. Similarly, at Northeastern in Boston, dozens of student groups and individuals formed the Huskies Organizing With Labor, a coalition of students, faculty, and student organizations that has stood in solidarity and supported dining hall workers at Northeastern in Local 26, who earlier this year won theirmost lucrative contract in local union history. This is the power of labor organizing that considers the many challenges faced by workers of all occupations, races, genders, sexualities, and more identities and positionalities — which are precisely the considerations that led to the development of a proposal for a comprehensive grievance process. Like throughout the rest of the country, in order to win better conditions and dignity at MIT, we must understand that these fights are not only intertwined, but they are one and the same — this is as true historically as it is today. Demanding the contract that we need and building the community we want So what are we workers, and all students, at MIT called to do? To start, we must understand that solidarity is a verb; it is an active and principled process that involves committing ourselves to each other toward the betterment of all. For issues like the lack of sufficient grievance processes and others named above, it is not enough to stand by and wait for MIT’s administration to treat our coworkers and classmates better and to take responsibility for the work environments they enable. We have seen how insufficient current policy and enforcement can be, and only through coming together as a collective can we see the improvements necessary for a better life at the institute forall. We have to move past words and broad statements about “belonging” and take action to see a truly inclusive community formed here at MIT and codified through a contract. Events like town halls and subsequent actions happening this week are examples of what it will take to apply pressure on the administration. These are opportunities to participate, learn more about the struggles faced by fellow coworkers, and stand together in solidarity so the MIT administration understands that this is not trivial. Ultimately, we are only going to be able to win a fair contract for grad workers at MIT with a just and empowering grievance procedure in the same way that we won our union in the first place. We need to come together and show the administration that we are united and ready to do what it takes to get the contract we deserve. We highly encourage folks tojoin the Contract Action Teamto also help with outreach, communications and actions to help us all achieve the fair contract we deserve. And beyond this, we can all have conversations with our coworkers about the contract proposals — how they might concretely and positively impact each of us and our communities on campus. We all have a role in normalizing these conversations, building stronger relationships in our workplaces, and building an MIT that works for all.

rice_thresher_2022_36,"ByAdel Iqbal4/12/22 11:04pm ​​Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. On March 21 in a recentpress release, Rice University enthusiastically announced it had approved a five-year, $10 million bid for Saudi Arabian Oil Company’s (Aramco involvement in Carbon Hub, a university-led research initiative committed to accelerating the energy transition toward sustainable hydrocarbons. In this same announcement, Rice’s Matteo Pasquali, a chemical engineer who directs Carbon Hub, construed the development in a positive manner, expressing his unequivocal excitement to “welcome the Aramco group” as “great partners” for facilitating a more sustainable future. However, this innocuous press release failed to acknowledge the global atrocities, past and present, perpetrated by Aramco, and by extension, the incumbent government of Saudi Arabia. The Rice administration’s decision to pursue this collaboration in the absence of due ethical consideration is a profound betrayal of our university’s commitments encompassing global scholarship and academic freedom. It sends the message that heinous human rights violations can be overlooked in exchange for economic profits. It reaffirms unwarranted impunity for Saudi Arabia’s egregious transgressions of international humanitarian law. Most notably, it institutes a precedent for whitewashing authoritarianism through education. Rice must not lend its credibility to a rogue regime actively engaged in political persecution, asymmetric hostilities and destabilizing reforms. Allowing for consideration of Saudi Arabia’s political campaigns as a paradigm for oppression, the need for Rice to respond decisively becomes evident. In Yemen, the Saudi regime continues to subjugate innocent civilians through over24,000lethal air raids since 2015 and a catastrophic naval blockade leaving47.5%of Yemeni children lacking access to adequate healthcare and nutritional supplies. The resultant circumstances have become widely synonymous with the world’sworst humanitarian crisis. Domestically, there are no signs indicating all people are perceived as having the same intrinsic value: from the arbitrary detention of prominentfeminist scholarsto marginalizing LGBTQ minorities with vague provisions of uncodified law to threaten imprisonment orcapital punishment,patriarchal power dynamics constitute the status quo. Internationally, it continues its global assault on freedom of speech and academic freedoms, silencing critics accused of government dissent withdismemberment.For Rice to even consider engaging in this relationship given the current state of global affairs is both irresponsible and unpatriotic. The Rice community should bear no interest in planting the seeds for this zero-sum partnership. Put another way, the de facto Saudi regime — governed by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman — does not care for an accelerated energy transition, the proliferation of renewable energy or a novel architecture for energy security, despite its best efforts topostureas a progressive catalyst for progressive reform. In fact,unattenuatedadvancements in these critical areas would undermine the economic outlook for the world’s largest oil-producing countries, Saudi included. Very much mirroring the superficial social reforms codified in Saudi Arabia to accelerate westernization, these collaborations assembled by well-regarded academic institutions veil the more severe structural issues at hand. Rice must learn from themisstepsof peer institutions and not put its reputation up for sale. I would like to reiterate emphasis on my objection to the MBS regime and not the people of Saudi Arabia. The Rice community has and continues to stand firmly behind the valued contributions of our esteemed Saudi colleagues. They are not a reflection of the reprehensible actions of their country’s leadership. However, Rice University must not miscalculate the risks of legitimizing authoritarian pursuits through a financial relationship with the incumbent Saudi government. Having lived in the Kingdom for 15 years, there is no question in my mind that an uncritical commitment to strengthening this relationship would antagonize honest discourse on the heinous war crimes and human rights abuses prevailing in the Middle East. With the impending threat of financial retaliation, the demise of ideological autonomy, compelled speech and political complacency must not be put up for negotiation. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_32,"I was 11 years old when I found out I’d been mutilated. I was standing in the yellow light of the bathroom, feet clammy against the cold tile. Gut-churning feelings washed over me: confusion, disgust, and, most of all, violation. My body had been altered irrevocably without my consent. No one had ever told me; rather, an internet rabbit hole impersonally informed me that I could never live in the body in which I was originally born. I never had a say in it, because they had done it to me hours after I was born. The worst part of it all is that I’m not the only one in this situation — in fact, I’m far from alone. As of 2016, an estimated 71.2 percent of men in the United States are circumcised. I understand that not every circumcised man thinks about this. Most either never consider the absurdity of their condition or are content with it. But it seems that these men would also be happy without being circumcised, as the majority of men throughout history have been. For the millions of us who do feel the lack, what recourse is there? There’s no way to get back what was taken from us, and there’s hardly even a movement to rally behind. Harvard is full of socially conscious young people. Walking through the Yard, opinions fly left and right about reproductive rights, racism, Israel-Palestine, and more — a myriad of ideological battles waged daily through flyers, demonstrations, and walkouts. And yet, it seems we’ve missed this one: When it comes to circumcision, everyone acts like it’s normal. In reality, it isn’t normal. America is the only major Western country to believe in and practice circumcision at such a high level. As of 2021, nearly half of Americans find routine infant circumcision acceptable, while another sizable proportion has no opinion either way. Conversely, in most European countries, less than 10 percent of men are circumcised. Circumcising babies is wrong. Some have a perception that the practice is natural, yet the natural state of the body is not circumcised. Oftentimes, people cite medical benefits as reasons to circumcise; however, these benefits are marginal at best and unfounded at worst. Others say that the issue is exclusively the parents’ business, yet we generally agree that it’s wrong for parents to modify their children’s bodies in other ways, such as tattooing. Some religious populations, such as Jews and Muslims, argue that circumcising their children is ordained by their religion, but religious freedoms should naturally end where another person’s freedoms begin. The human rights to bodily autonomy and religious freedom should extend to every child, regardless of their parents’ religion; segments of the Jewish population in fact recognize this right and propose the Brit Shalom, an alternative naming ceremony that delays circumcision until the man is old enough to make the decision for himself. To object to the mutilation of a baby boy’s penis should not be in any way radical. On the contrary, this objection seems like a natural product of human reason and compassion. So why do we remain content with circumcision? It seems that a large part of the issue is the cycle of shame. Although the evidence is all freely available, we don’t talk about circumcision because it’s taboo. We’ve taken a widespread issue and convinced ourselves it’s private or shameful just because it’s inflicted on our genitals. Furthermore, conceptions of masculinity play a role. In order for a circumcised man to advocate against circumcision, he must first acknowledge that he was made a victim at the most vulnerable time in his life. Frankly, many men do not feel strong enough to admit this. And so the cycle continues, the issue is ignored or downplayed, and people inflict the same violence on their children for generations. There are signs of hope. American infant circumcision rates have slowly but surely dropped in recent decades. With each successive generation, fewer parents believe that all male babies should be circumcised. However, there’s still a lot more work to be done. To this day, 58.3 percent of baby boys born in America will be circumcised. Our generation has an affinity for shedding light on injustice, eschewing taboos, and discussing difficult issues. This Sex Week, Harvard undergraduates will come together in open discussion to change the culture of shame around our bodies and genitals. By also talking about circumcision, we can inspire the shift towards bodily autonomy for all. James P. GaNun ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Philosophy concentrator in Pforzheimer House."
stanforddaily_2022_19,"On Oct. 12, Stanford University President Marc Tessier-Lavigne released astatementapologizing on behalf of the university for limiting admissions for Jewish students in the 1950s. Allegations of unfair admissions policies were brought to light by Charles Petersen, a postdoctoral fellow in the Cornell History Department, in his blogpost“How I Discovered Stanford’s Jewish Quota.” Subsequently, a task force was appointed by Tessier-Lavigne to investigate the situation andfound“evidence of actions taken to suppress the number of Jewish students admitted to Stanford during the early 1950s.” In the 1950s, Stanford’s application did notaskabout a student’s religion or ethnicity. Thus, former admissions director Rixford Snyder, wishing to limit enrollment of Jewish students, needed a proxy to determine whether a student was Jewish. According to the President’sstatement, discriminatory practices were found in admitting students from “two high schools in Los Angeles — Beverly Hills and Fairfax — whose student populations were between ‘95 to 98% Jewish.’” Task force members “founda ‘sharp drop’ in the number of students enrolled at Stanford from those schools — 87 enrolled during 1949-1952, but only 14 in 1952-55 — that was not seen in any other public schools during the 1950s and 1960s.” In short, Snyder denied students from certain high schools with high proportions of Jewish students to work around thepolicythat Stanford did not make admissions decisions based on race or religion. Firstly, I want to commend Stanford on its apology; it is rare that a university of its stature atones for its wrongdoings. However, as an Asian American, I cannot help but feel uncomfortable about the context of this apology. It comes at a time when Asian American students believe they are facing similar issues to those which Jewish students did in the 1950s, such assubjectiveadmissions criteria andlowerrelative acceptance rates, which have arisen as a result of Harvard’s admissions lawsuit. Given yesterday’s Supreme Courthearingabout race-conscious admissions, I want to preface that this piece is not about“affirmative action,”which I wholeheartedly believe is vital in curating a diverse class. It is also not a piece falselyequatingthe barriers for Jewish students in the 1950s with those for Asian American students, as the situations are contextually incomparable. Nevertheless, I believe the recent events that have transpired warrant a discussion about the state of admissions for Asian American students. One point ofcontentionis that Asian Americans score lower on the “personal rating,” a score that Harvard describes as exemplifying “qualities of character” such as “courage,” “leadership” and “humility,” among other traits. The usage of “personal qualities” was also a concern in the 1950s at Stanford among the faculty admissions committee thatbelievedthe ten-point scale used to admit applicants, of which four points were devoted to the “personal rating,” was “avowedly subjective.” Today, Stanford utilizes a “personal rating” similar to both Harvard’s rating and the ten-point scale in the 1950s under a category called “SPIV,” which is believed to refer to“intellectual vitality.” Anotherremarkin the lawsuit is that “between 2003 and 2012, the percentage of Asian Americans at Harvard wavered only slightly above and below approximately 17 percent,” in spite of the fact that “by 2008, Asian Americans made up over 27 percent of Harvard’s applicant pool.” Similarly, one of Snyder’sconcernswas “that more than one quarter of the applications from men were from Jewish boys,” and that growing competition among the applicant pool meant that he “needed to develop a rationale for determining which students to admit and which to reject.” While Stanford does not release applicant statistics by race, there is no reason to believe they substantially differ from Harvard’s. Moreover, there is precedent to suggest that discrimination may exist. Stanford has discriminated against Asian American applicants in the past; in 1986, Stanford junior Jeffrey Auraisedconcerns about Asian American admissions and why, according to the Los AngelesTimes, “the admission rate for Asian-Americans was only 65% to 70% that for whites.” Stanford’s Academic Senate Committeefoundthat “‘unconscious bias’ caused the discrepancy in admissions rates and immediately following the report, admissions rates for Asian American students increased to 89 percent of the white admission rate.” Furthermore, in the 1980s, other elite schools such as Brown University and University of California, Berkeley found evidence of discrimination against Asian Americans, with the former concluding that there was a“serious problem”after an internal review and the latter releasing a statement apologizing for“disadvantaging Asians.” Nowadays, potential biases that were present in the 1950s and the 1980s remain, and investigations in both historic cases have led to evidence of discriminatory practices. Stanford, if you are willing to investigate unfair admissions policies from the 1950s, which raise concerns similar to those about policies today, you ought to also investigate your policies in 2022 and make them transparent. Do we have to wait for incriminating evidence in the vein of Petersen’sdiscoveryof Jewish quotas before engaging in such a discussion? For my Asian American peers at Stanford, it is easy to become complacent as beneficiaries of the system. You may look at youradmissions fileand disagree with this piece, but it is important to realize that for your application to have been accepted notwithstanding your race,more than twenty were rejected— and we do not know why. From the task force report, Paul Seaver, who joined the Stanford faculty in 1964 from Reed College,claimedthat “The kids I knew at Reed said, ‘Stanford doesn’t admit Jews, certainly not from Los Angeles.’” Thereportmakes the point that part of the problem “is not whether Seaver’s impression of Stanford’s admissions processes was accurate, but that the impression was so widespread.” The samebeliefrings true today for many Asian American students. So please, can we have another conversation about the policies by which you admit Asian American students? This entails discussing the uncomfortable details after controlling for factors other than race. For example: Stanford, I welcome race being considered a factor in admissions so long as it helps foster equity rather than harms specific groups. All I am calling for is transparency. You can only stand to gain by improving your reputation as a school with fair admissions — however you define “fair” — among Asian American communities, the subject of which has causedcontroversyfor several decades.

stanforddaily_2022_112,"Following the conclusion of residential student staff applications, students across campus are beginning to consider housing for next year — but for the first time in Stanford’s history, we will largely stay in our STANFORD neighborhoods with our respective S, T, A, N, etc. friends and facilities, dorms and dining halls. Recent emails from R&DE Student Housing Assignments state that students who want to switch neighborhoods (not via the Office of Accessible Education or the Title IX Office “will not be able to select which neighborhood you would like to change into”. Furthermore, “if you change neighborhoods, you will select your building and room assignment after all others in your class year.” These measures are essentially sanctions on students who find community or more comfortable environments elsewhere, and will affect many: a social media poll by the Stanford Daily found that less than half of social media respondents want to stay in their ResX neighborhood in the next academic year. You can’t force people to be part of a community, nor can you force them to feel at home in a fixed place. Why should students be actively punished for not making friends who live near them in the space of two quarters? This is strangely authoritarian. The neighborhood housing system encourages students to simply “choose” to like and bond with people living in their area, thereby investing less time and energy into cross-campus friendships. The new system is especially problematic as the vast majority of students find that Stanford has not supported this transition. According to further polls by The Daily, only 15% of over 300 social media respondents considered their ResX neighborhoods to be a strong community, while 91% felt that Stanford has not done enough to foster neighborhood community. Indeed, neighborhoods can be surprisingly scattered — for example, it’s unclear how someone living in EVGR should feel any affinity with someone living in GovCo — and apart from that one barbecue, can anyone think of a neighborhood-wide event? The current maintenance of neighborhoods purely consists of dramatic disincentives to move out, rather than positive incentives to stay. The neighborhood system hasn’t changed how we bond with those who live near us, whether that’s in your dorm or a short walk away. What has changed is the freedom that students have to live with their friends from farther afield. Equally, shouldn’t we have diverse housing options simply for a more exciting and well-rounded living experience? West Campus dwellers speak wistfully of living in Toyon, or not being a five-minute bike ride away from Main Quad. Conversely, those on East Campus complain about the lack of singles and two-room doubles. If ResEd believes the neighborhoods are equal across factors such as housing and dining accommodations, accessibility and desirability of location, would it really be necessary to prevent students from choosing which neighborhood they would like to join? This limitation, combined with proposals to move buildings to different neighborhoods (e.g. “moving Pluto and 650 Mayfield from Neighborhood N to Neighborhood A” suggests that the University knows certain neighborhoods are much more popular than others due to their superior buildings and locations. If the neighborhoods were equal in the important amenities that affect our everyday quality of life, surely there should be no problem with allowing students to choose the neighborhood to which they would like to move. If Stanford is looking to imitate the college system at peer institutions, it’ll have to do much more to foster distinct neighborhood identities and spirits — both of which will take time. To their credit, University leaders are actively taking student feedback and implementing real changes in response, including the launch of neighborhood community councils. I appreciate that ResEd is trying to make radical changes with a view to providing stronger communities for students farther down the line. But in transitioning to that future, it is not fruitful to isolate individuals. College is a time to make lifelong friendships, which has already been vastly complicated by COVID. Stanford should not sacrifice current students’ happiness and comfort for a lofty long-term goal: let us choose and change neighborhoods without penalties.

state_press_2022_39,"New ASU football head coach Kenny Dillingham speaking during his introduction press conference in the San Tan Ford Club at Sun Devil Stadium on Sunday, Nov. 27, 2022. ASUhiringKenny Dillingham as its head football coach is exactly the kind of move the University should have made years ago. Dillingham, a young leader with local roots, has exactly what it takes to become a great head coach at ASU, the first great head coach the University will have had in a long time. To start out, I know what you re thinking. When Ilistedthe obvious candidates for ASU s next head football coach, Dillingham didn t make the cut. I saw your emails, your comments and your messages. My bad! At the time, my reasoning went that Shaun Aguano and Danny Gonzales had more recently coached at ASU. Jonathan Smith, Justin Wilcox and Kalani Sitake had previous college head coaching experience that Dillingham did not. But, nonetheless, Dillingham should have been on the list. Dillingham is replacing Herm Edwards, and one of the biggest separating factors between the two is age — Dillingham is 32 years old, while Edwards is 68. Dillingham is more dynamic, while Edwards fits into the classic mold of a football coach. You really do need somebody who is willing and able not only to keep up with all of the changes, but really embrace all those changes, and I get the sense Herm Edwards and his staff was reluctant to adjust to the current state and the future state of college football, said Sarah Kezele, a voice on Bickley & Marotta Mornings on Arizona Sports radio. READ MORE:Arizona native and ASU alumnus Kenny Dillingham to be next head football coach Local roots for a head coach are crucial, and Dillingham has thoserootswhen Edwards never did. Dillingham grew up playing football at Chaparral High in Scottsdale before becoming an offensive assistant at ASU in 2014-15. He recently had aconference callwith dozens of high school coaches in Arizona. He went on to assist and coach at Memphis from 2016 to 2018. Importantly, Dillingham recruited well at Memphis; he was named the 2017 No. 2 recruiter in the American Athletic Conference by 247Sports. That kind of recruiting talent is sorely needed at ASU, as the University has struggled in that department. The 2023 ASU recruiting class includes no Arizona players. ASU is supposed to be the best University in Arizona to play football (or at least, it should be . Hopefully, Dillingham can make that statement ring true by bringing in the state s best recruits. If you want to score points, if you want to get the football, if you want to go up and down the field, if you want to (have your play on SportsCenter, this is a great place for you, Dillingham said in his introductory press conference Sunday. On the defensive side of the ball, we re going to attack. If you like sacks, if you like (tackles for loss , if you like playing man-to-man coverage to put on tape for NFL teams that you can play man-to-man coverage, you re going to want to come here because that s what we re going to do. Everything about this program is going to be attacking. However, local roots and recruiting chops aren t the only necessary assets to win games – Dillingham needs to be a good offensive coach and know how to lead a team. Luckily for the Sun Devils, Dillingham has those skill sets. Throughhis time as an offensive coordinatorat Memphis, Auburn, Florida State and Oregon, Dillingham led high-scoring, prolific offenses. His 2018 Memphis squad set a school record for rushing yards in a season, and at Auburn and Oregon, his teams averaged 33.2 and 39.7 points, respectively. In terms of Dillingham s ability to lead a team, there seems to be little doubt: He is a natural leader. This is literally home, Dillingham said Sunday. I say that because this place is special. The people in this room are special. ... I m going to be fired up to be here, fired up to be a Sun Devil. What this place needs to be successful, we need the entire Valley to come together. When you talk about a person and family that s rooted here, that s me. Outside of being an offensive wizard and his leadership ability, Dillingham also worked as a quarterbacks coach at Memphis, Auburn and Florida State. Most notably, he coached Bo Nix at Auburn and Oregon, who has developed into one of the top quarterbacks in the country and is already apotential2023 NFL Draft pick. ASU could use a long-term quarterback, especially after Jayden Daniels transferred to LSU. It doesn t help Sun Devil fans to see Danielsshiningat LSU in a way he never really did at ASU. The task is tall, but if Dillingham can find a quarterback and create a winner out of him, that would do a lot for ASU to stay afloat in the high-scoring Pac-12. Yet, there are questions to be had with Dillingham. He has never been a head coach at the college level — will the learning curve be handled quickly enough by Dillingham to satisfy University leaders? How will his team look outside of the offensive side of the ball? Dillingham will need a strong defense in order to climb to the top of the Pac-12. He also has a lack of play-calling experience. His one season at Oregon is the only time he has called plays at the collegiate level. Of course, it s not a guarantee he will be calling the plays at ASU, but if he does, it is something to keep an eye on. Even with those concerns, Dillingham is clearly the best hire ASU football has made in a long while. If he can answer the few questions that remain about him and bring the team to success within a few years, it s likely Dillingham will be in Tempe for the long term.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_11,"Modify your diet, drive an electric vehicle, travel less: Students across the country are being taught that these actions have a large impact on the prevention of climate change. While individual actions are undoubtedly contributing to the climate crisis, it would be incorrect to assume that they hold the greatest responsibility. Students and the general public alike must be taught, not only about the personal changes they can make, but also about how large corporations are responsible for the real damage being done to the climate. Since 1988,71%of global greenhouse gas emissions have been produced by just 100 fossil fuel companies. In data released in 2019, it was revealed that 20 fossil fuel companies make upone-thirdof all emissions. Corporations clearly play a major role in the climate problem. The fossil fuels burned by such companies release dangerous amounts of carbon dioxide into the air, trapping heat in the atmosphere and causing climatic warming. As the temperatures rise, it seems clear that fossil fuel companies are both the ones who need to be held responsible and should have their offenses known by the general public. Even more disturbing, a 2015investigationrevealed that Exxon, the second-largest investor-owned producer of greenhouse gasses, had known about the damages resulting from climate change for decades. Despite this knowledge, they actively took steps to block measures that would cut emissions. Exxon knew about the irreversible damage they were doing and lied about the consequences to the general public, denying any evidence provided. The United States doesn’t have a national requirement for climate science to be taught inK-12 education, meaning each state decides what is, or is not, taught about climate change in schools. According to a 2016 report from theNational Center for Science Education, more than a quarter of science teachers give equal time to perspectives that doubt the scientific consensus surrounding climate change to those that support it, even though there is an overwhelmingly agreed-uponconsensusamong climate scientists. Similarly, 34% of teachers do not believe that recent global warming is primarily a result of human activity. Unsurprisingly, this leads to a wide spectrum ofcomprehension levelssurrounding climate change in the United States. This lack of a countrywide standard of understanding produces a population that lacks the tools to properly understand and combat climate change. Fossil fuel companies have taken advantage of the lack of a national standard for climate education by inserting their narrative wherever possible. These companies have worked extensively to ensure that they control the narrative around climate change — even in schools. They have even produced freeeducation modelswidely available to educators that frame climate change as consumer-caused. These education models don’t deny climate change, but instead focus on ways in which students can change their daily habits to reduce emissions. By providing free tools to teachers, fossil fuel companies are able to provide carefully calculated misinformation to students at a young age. One clear example of public manipulation by fossil fuel companies is the concept of the carbon footprint — a common aspect of high school environmental science curriculum. At first glance, the concept of the “carbon footprint” seems like a good way to calculate and visualize the carbon emissions one produces. However, it was actually a term that British Petroleum (BP promoted and popularizednearly two decades ago. The carbon footprint was just one aspect of a massive PR campaign that infiltrated education attempting to redirect focus on individual actions contributing to climate change. Nobody can argue that reducing an individual’s carbon footprint is a bad thing, which BP understood and took advantage of. The majority of climate education cannot be reliant on urging personal changes, but rather on holding the largest greenhouse gas emitters responsible and forcing such corporations to change. In a nation where25%of the population is unsure of or does not believe in climate change, the lack of comprehensive climate education isn’t too surprising. However, as the climate continues to warm it is increasingly concerning, damaging and deadly. In order to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for their actions relating to climate change, the narrative that consumers are solely to blame must be publicly rejected in education. Sure, eating less meat or driving an electric vehicle can have positive effects on the environment, but without action from fossil fuel companies, their impact won’t be enough.

wildcat_arizona_2022_77,"Teenage girl with braces stands in front of mirror and inspects face. As I close in on my freshman year of college, I find the feeling of nostalgia to be one of the most ever-growing presences in both my peers and my young adult life. Oddly enough, we experience a large portion of this nostalgia through social media, particularly TikTok. We scroll through and are greeted with college decision videos, homecoming “get ready with me’s” and braces getting taken off. We like these videos; they piece together special moments of our lives that we, in some ways, get to relive through social media. The only problem is, a growing number of these videos don’t feel familiar in the slightest, and it’s not just because we aren’t in high school anymore. My TikTok scrolling was interrupted the other day by a video that I at first thought was one of my peers celebrating her birthday. She had on a shirt that I also have and jeans I would wear. I wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest to see her at a frat party. Upon further inspection, I became incredibly uncomfortable. The balloons in the back didn’t say 19 or 20 – they said 13. Upon seeing this, I thought back to my 13th birthday. I was covered in acne, had a mouth full of metal and was nowhere near as beautiful or grown-up looking as this 13-year-old. Many comments on this video read that she was dressed and looked like a 20-year-old. She responded to these comments by saying that it’s her body and they should stop “sexualizing her.” In the age of Facetune and Instagram, it’s almost impossible for these younger generations of girls to not feel pressure to skip the awkward phase and head straight into the sex appeal of womanhood. An excerpt from a 2019New Yorker articletalks about the age of “Instagram face”: catlike eyes, teeny nose and full lips. The face is beautiful and Facetuned to perfection within our favorite models, influencers and TikTokers (filter or not . It’s a pressure our generation, only a few years older, never felt – at least not when we were 13. We made innocent dance Musical.lys or giggled to our favorite Vines. We looked every bit of our age. So, what’s changed? University of Arizona freshman Jolie Orban has a large TikTok following of 81,000 – and she had some thoughts on the subject. “When I was getting popular on the app, I felt lots of pressure to change how I dressed and looked to get more interaction with my content,” Orban said. “It impacted how I viewed myself, as I personally like to avoid sexualizing myself on the internet.” Jolie is certainly not alone in this feeling, as this pressure is only continuing to grow, especially for the younger generations of girls. They scroll through their TikTok or Instagram feed and are greeted with women five-plus years older than them – often with faces or photos that are incredibly edited or augmented. Naturally, these young girls create the expectation that they should look like them. So, they buy their same clothes and post the same revealing photos. Most times, the only difference between them and actual adult women is that most of them haven’t even graduated middle school. As expected, this skip of the awkward phase is nowhere near as prevalent within young boys as it is with girls. According to a 2021BBC article, boys and girls’ mental well-being is fairly similar at the elementary school age. However, after about age 14, the self-esteem of girls drops significantly below that of boys. In fact, the research study discussed in the article showed that one in three girls were unhappy with their appearance by the time middle school was over. It’s no secret that the pressure is on young girls and the effects are troublesome. Unfortunately, they don’t seem to understand the concerning implications of presenting yourself so maturely online, and can we blame them? The problem isn’t them – it’s the inability of today’s society to just let kids be kids. My hope is that the toxicity of social media can die down and that these young girls realize they do not need to be hot, desirable or sexually liberated – they just need to be 13.

It’s like, who did this?” This is a sentiment I kept hearing on campus these past weeks. And the answer is, no, the weather is not nice. It’s alevel 5 drought. That is the highest level. 5/5. This is only thesecond timewe have hit level 5 in BC. The first time was last year during the heat dome whichkilled hundreds of peopleanddecimated sea-life. According toThe Canadian Press, Vancouver sees around 165 millimetres of rain between July and mid-October. This year it has rained 16 millimetres. Las Vegas got more rain than Vancouverthis summer. Wildfires rage in late October, and as the drought stretches into salmon spawning season, streams are running dry, with one particularlyhorrific videofrom Heiltsuk territory showing a dry stream bed littered with dead salmon. No, the weather is not nice: the smoke thatbillows off Cypress mountainto obscure the mountains, the heat in the fall, the smell of the dry and burning rainforest. Welcome to the anthropocene. The climate crisis. As for who did this? Who ordered the sunny skies? Well,mostly fossil fuel companies did, but we shouldn’t let ourselves off too easily either. According to thesixth IPCCreport, anthropogenic (anthro → human → our fault climate change causes and worsens droughts. The report also warns that “Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation willmiss a brief and rapidly closingwindow of opportunity to secure aliveableand sustainable future for all.” . And we are continuing to put in orders for dry summers and rising seas, locking in emissions that will drive up global temperatures. The rain has returned, but it may not bring respite. Drought hardens the ground, making itmore susceptibleto flooding and erosion. A week of heavy rain could wreak havoc on the landscape, sending landslides crashing into the streams and rivers. Rain running over soil as if it was concrete, shearing off anything that cannot hold on. We might not notice from UBC’s sparkling towers, but that does not mean it isn’t happening. If all this unsettles you, good.I want you to panic. We get there is a climate crisis and we know October should be well into the season of the dripping raincoat. And still… “isn’t the weather nice?” Are we not connecting the dots? Or perhaps bored of this monotonous cataclysm? Sometimes eco-anxiety gets the better of me and comments about the nice weather start to chip away at the thin veneer of my composure. But then I remember — this is our future. We will live the rest of our lives in this crisis, and while I believe we have the responsibility to bear witness and to take action, we also have to live. To enjoy the sublime beauty of the natural world. It is the little things that will get us through. Wind in the trees. Seaweed in the current. Or my dog’s fascination with the smell of wet grass and concrete today after one millimetre of rain (that smell is calledpetrichorwhich is, incidentally, an awesome word . At least for me, it’s always the little things. If it is to be sunny in October, I suppose we should enjoy the sunset. But don’t forget that October’s sunny skies are because of the climate crisis.

stanforddaily_2022_62,"Nina Berlin Rubin, Marius von Essen, Anna Gomes, Brian Rogers and Laurel Regibeau-Rockett are Ph.D. candidates in Earth System Science. Stanfordrecently announcedthat donors have contributed nearly $1.7 billion to establish the Doerr School of Sustainability, the University’s first new school in 70 years. While these funds will support crucial research related to the climate crisis, the administration of the new school has made clear that it willcontinue accepting financial contributions from the fossil fuel industry. Stanford’s decision to maintain its ties to the fossil fuel industry is incompatible with the new school’s focus on actionable solutions to address climate change. Let’s be clear: fossil fuel companies’ contributions to universities such as Stanford are not only philanthropic. These donations are part of a carefully crafted smokescreen, one that disguises their role in a crisis they’re perpetuating, one that helps them gain false legitimacy, and one that wins them influence on climate change-related research. Over the last several months, we’ve developed an open letter and accompanying petition for the Stanford community to sign, calling on the School of Sustainability to decline funding from fossil fuel companies. This is an ask with an immense amount of support from the community: ina recent survey, graduate students in the School of Earth ranked declining funding from problematic or polluting industries such as fossil fuel companies as the most important measure for the new school to implement. With so much at stake for current and future generations facing the impacts of climate change, it’s crucial that leading institutions like Stanford use their influence and resources to signal the urgent need for climate action. For the Doerr School, this can start with changing attitudes towards funding from the fossil fuel industry. In order to truly align with its mission, it is critical that the Doerr School of Sustainability be sustainable not only in name, but also in action. By sharing our open letter below, we hope to motivate others here at Stanford to take action and speak out in support of a better world. If you’d like to share your support, you can sign the petitionhere. — Graduate Student Advisory Committee, Department of Earth System Science ___ Dear Dr. Arun Majumdar, Dean of the Doerr School of Sustainability, Congratulations on your recent appointment as Dean of the newly established Doerr School of Sustainability. We are grateful for your leadership, vision and career dedicated to a sustainable energy future. The formation of this new School marks a historic opportunity for Stanford University to take a bold effort toward mitigating climate change. Stanford’s School of Earth, Energy and the Environment relies heavily on fossil fuel funding, and we believe such funding represents an inherent conflict of interest, is incompatible with the University’s core academic and social values, and supports industry greenwashing. We, the undersigned faculty, students, postdocs, staff and alumni of Stanford University, therefore call for the Doerr School of Sustainability and affiliated institutions to decline funding from fossil fuel companies.Instead, the School should seek out partnerships with organizations and companies who are fully aligned with Stanford’s vision of achieving carbon neutrality. We want to note that our call applies to the Doerr School of Sustainability and affiliated institutions, not to the funding obtained by individual faculty members. Continuing to accept funding from and collaborating with the fossil fuel industry presents a conflict of interest for the School of Sustainability, as many fossil fuel companies have a proven record of actively obscuring the scientific consensus on climate change, obstructing climate policy and knowingly and willingly perpetuating the climate crisis. Contrary to messages promoted by the industry, the core business of fossil fuel companies remains the production and distribution of fossil fuels, and substantial diversification into clean and renewable energyhas not occurred. By collaborating with fossil fuel companies, the Schoolendangers its academic integrity. It is difficult to imagine that fossil fuel companies — whose core business model is diametrically opposed to science-led climate action — are appropriate partners for climate-related research. It is no longer reasonable, let alone ethical, for the School to maintain its ties with the industry most responsible for perpetuating the climate crisis. Strong collaboration between the School of Sustainability and the fossil fuel industry also threatens our school’s credibility, reputation and attractiveness for current and prospective students, staff and faculty. Though these companies present themselves as leaders in sustainability, their investments in oil and gas continue to dwarf their renewable energy investments, which represent just a small percentage of their total capital expenditure. Collaborating with these companies isinimical to academic institutions’ pledges for climate action. Continued funding from fossil fuel companies threatens to erode trust in Stanford’s scientific and cultural commitment to climate action. The research conducted at Stanford carries significant weight in the conversation around tackling the climate crisis, and the University cannot afford to lose out on the brightest talents or have its voice compromised. We appreciate the impacts that a change in the attitude towards fossil fuel funding will have on the Doerr School of Sustainability and its affiliated institutions. However, we believe that Stanford’s location, history and connections to the private sector will enable the School of Sustainability to forge new relations and partnerships that are aligned with its vision and values. Scientific research tells us that the window for action is closing, and we believe that as one of the world’s leading academic institutions, we have a moral responsibility to act. Sincerely yours, The undersigned faculty, students, postdocs, staff and alumni of Stanford University See the list of signeeshere.

crimson_2022_49,"Last week, protests opposing bothstrict zero-Covid policiesand the rule of Xi Jinping erupted in China, providing another opportunity for Americans to once again consider the complex relationship between Beijing and Washington. Perhaps, some may hope, this is finally the moment: At last, America can act to support protestors and topple our great authoritarian opponent. While such a pattern of thought may be tempting to westerners, cutting ties with China in this fraught moment to gamble on regime change ignores geopolitical realities and undermines our collective future. In his landmark article in Foreign Affairs Magazine, Samuel P. Huntington predicted future conflict between China and the United States. Watching the two superpowers edge ever closer to conflict feels not unlike watching a meteoric, eon-altering car crash in slow motion — the two massive hegemons speeding directly at one another with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. To say that the conflict, if it comes to pass, will define our generation is an understatement of biblical proportions. Beset by (well-founded allegations of human rights abuses, zero-Covid woes, the authoritarian rise of Xi Jinping (justbeginning an unprecedented third term , and fierce protests, China draws derision and hysterics from the West. Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the state of U.S.-China relations. According to thePew Research Center, roughly nine in 10 adults consider China a competitor or enemy. This sentiment is not just an abstract political consideration — amid right-wing vitriol about the alleged Chinese fabrication of the “Wuhan virus,” incidents of anti-Asian hate crime rose a staggering 339 percent in a single year. Such a grim assessment of China will not lead the United States anywhere. Where the Soviet Union was frail and weak, China is prosperous and strong. Married with wide-ranging use of modern technology, the authoritarian structure of the Chinese government results in a highly digitized, efficient society. A nice example of this phenomenon is the Chinese app WeChat, a Tencent-owned service that combines features ranging from mobile payments to social media to video games. Nearly all activity is subject to oversight by the Chinese Communist Party. This hyper-centralized system sounds foreign and unreasonable to American ears but is simply a fact of life for Chinese citizens. And rest assured that the current regime in China is here to stay — the state will handle the recent wave of protests, against the hopes of many westerners. This authoritarian machine has dealt with instability in the past, including in Hong Kong, where China passed stricter security measures in response to 2020 unrest against a controversial extradition bill, and Beijing, where China survived the seismic waves of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. The security arm of the CCP has already swung into action, and while the instability may remain in the short term, there is no reason to believe this will be the ultimate downfall of centralized rule. In the face ofdomestic instabilityand challenges from China abroad, America has lost its position as the sole hegemon on the world stage. Many view that as lamentable, a change we must try desperately to stave off. I disagree. It’s time Americans stop throwing pity parties and give up on trying to regain bygone dominance. Instead, we should chart a new course of bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and China, one founded on cultural exchange and the free flow of information. Education has an essential role to play in that effort. In order to forge a multinational future, multinational education is required — many Chinese students study in the U.S., for example (tellingly, this figure has also been dropping . A marker of the deep distrust between our two nations is the closure of language exchange programs in China, including Harvard’s own move torelocate the Beijing Academyto Taipei. In fairness, both nations have engaged in the language education warfare — China has opened hundreds of controversial “Confucius Institutes” abroad, whichsome have takenas a ploy to disseminate propaganda and further political ends. Just as both parties have played a part in the deterioration of the U.S.-China relationship, both parties must affirmatively pursue engagement to rebuild it. There is clearly appetite at Harvard for such cooperation. Consider the mission statements of the Harvard College China Forum, which “is dedicated to creating constructive dialogue on the challenges, trends, and issues affecting China,” or the Harvard Undergraduate Association for U.S.-China Relations, which is “committed to bridging the gap between the United States and China.” Also reflective of Harvard’s unique capacity to help solve the U.S.-China question is its preponderance of East Asian Studies concentrators: At the College, Harvard grants the highest number of East Asian Studies degrees in the country. In line with these sentiments, a strong first step toward great cooperation would be the re-institution of the Beijing Academy. Engaging with China first requires understanding China, and students should at least be given the option to study in the mainland. Harvard’s study abroad programs should be a model of cooperation and should thus make efforts to engage with China, not shy away from the mainland altogether in favor of a more “politically correct” approach. In particular, Harvard should build ties with Peking University, a school often considered the “Harvard of China.” Amid broader political uncertainty, closer ties between our institution and China have the opportunity to set a shining example of cooperation and trust. We should avoid the trap of politically-popular China-hawk rhetoric and instead act in line with the interests of the world and the opinions of our students. Harvard must act as a champion of international cooperation. Such a rethink would benefit our students, our nations, and the global community for decades to come. If humanity wants to escape from the impending wreckage, someone must decide to slam the brakes. Max A. Palys ’26, a Crimson Editorial comper, lives in Matthews Hall."
ubyssey_2022_0,"Sept. 28, 2022 Written byColby Payne In the fall of 2015, my grade 10 social studies class came upon one of the few mentions of Indigenous history in our textbook: a brief paragraph discussing Canada’s residential school system. The system, which was intended to forcibly assimilate children and “kill the Indian in the child,” operated from the late 1800s to 1996, during which an estimated 150,000 First Nations, Métis, and Inuit children were taken from their families to attend 139 schools across the country. Many children attending the schools experienced physical, mental, and sexual abuse. Children often had their hair forcibly cut, and were punished for speaking their languages and practising their cultural traditions. The final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded that the effects of the system constituted a form of cultural genocide, which the report describes as “the destruction of ... structures and practices that allow the targeted group to continue as a group.” After reading the paragraph on residential schools, one of my classmates felt the need to comment, asking why we should care about this when it happened so long ago. Feeling compelled to respond, I replied that, actually, it wasn’t that long ago — after all, my own grandma was taken from her family at six years old, sent to St. Bernard’s, or Grouard, residential school in Alberta. She never saw her father again. By the time she finished school around age 16, he had died and her family was irrevocably damaged. Obviously, my classmate’s dismissal of the impact of residential schools was upsetting — but what upset me most was my teacher’s response. “Would your grandma be able to come speak to the class about her experiences?” “No,” I responded. “She died before I was born.” At the time, it was simply the emotion of having to stand up for myself, and for the Indigenous community as a whole, as well as the mere fact of my grandmother’s death, that brought me to tears and angered me in that moment. In hindsight, it is the audacity of my teacher’s response to the situation that provokes the most rage and indignation in me. In that moment, the onus was on me — not on my teacher — to respond to my classmate and defend the importance of learning Indigenous history. This was a particularly glaring issue considering nobody had ever questioned the importance of the extensive Québecois history taught in our French immersion classroom. As I became upset, it was the only other Indigenous student in the class, and no one else, who comforted me. My teacher’s only response to me speaking about my personal experience of intergenerational trauma was to ask whether my grandma would be able to come and share her own traumatic experiences with our classroom, as if we existed solely to be instructional tools for settler classmates. This memory — and similar moments when people, not knowing that I was Indigenous, made ignorant and racist comments around me — arose last summer, when I was living with my family in Kamloops and working remotely in a co-op position with the federal government. On May 27, 2021, the Tk’emlúps te Secwépmec First Nation announced that preliminary findings from work conducted using ground-penetrating radar suggested the presence of 215 unmarked graves on the former grounds of the Kamloops Indian Residential School. In the following weeks and months, this announcement was followed by others detailing the discoveries of further unmarked graves found at residential school sites across the country. These discoveries were, of course, extremely upsetting; however, as an Indigenous person, they were not particularly surprising. Indigenous people have spoken for generations about the abuse and deaths that occurred in residential schools. Though my grandmother did not often discuss her experiences at residential school, I nevertheless grew up with a keen awareness of the trauma and destruction that occurred in the residential school system, both within and outside of my family. Cycles of intergenerational trauma and addiction, as well as the loss of language and cultural practices, are consequences of colonialism that have directly impacted myself and my loved ones. I continue to struggle with feelings of liminality, being both Indigenous and a settler, but not fully comfortable within either world. Sitting in government meetings last summer, and hearing settler colleagues in Ottawa express their shock and sadness over events that were both closer to home and not at all surprising to Indigenous communities, was extremely upsetting. These reactions and others like them were often more upsetting for me than the continued discovery of unmarked mass graves in the past year. They acted as if they could not believe what had happened, even though they had never bothered to listen to what Indigenous peoples have told them for decades about the devastation and destruction of colonization. Though I am happy to see people wearing orange shirts and proclaiming that every child matters, it is difficult for that happiness to not be overwhelmed by sadness and anger that it has taken this long. That so many were and continue to be unwilling to believe or even to listen to Indigenous peoples’ stories and perspectives. It is also continuously upsetting to see settler individuals’ desire for Indigenous individuals to provide documentation for their Indigeneity. While it is important to prevent instances of settlers claiming Indigeneity in order to gain opportunities, too often calls for documentation are really just continuations of racist and exclusionary government policies. For me, the most documentation that I could provide for my Indigeneity would be proof that my grandmother was stolen from her family and forced to attend residential school — this is documentation that I refuse to provide, because to me, it would represent an affirmation of the colonial system and an adherence to its policies and rules. With regard to Indigenous documentation and similar matters, I would ask that settler individuals truly listen to Indigenous individuals. There is more than enough information on the effects of colonialism in the world at this point ­— to me, at this point, it is unnecessary to either demand further evidence when copious evidence already exists, or to ask Indigenous individuals to perform the labour of repeatedly explaining our traumas. My hope is that, in the future, children like me will have individuals in schools who can advocate for them, rather than having to justify their own existences — and I hope that someday I will be one of the teachers who can do so.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_46,"A federallawsuitwas filed in Chicago against 16 of the nation’s top private universities on Jan. 9. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of five former undergraduate students who attended some of the institutions, argues that the colleges and universities used antitrust laws to limit students’ financial aid. The universities and colleges involved include Brown, the California Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Emory, Georgetown, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northwestern, Notre Dame, the University of Pennsylvania, Rice, Vanderbilt and Yale. The lawsuit takes aim at the universities’ method to calculate a student’s financial need. Each of the targeted institutions is part of a collaborative organization called the568 Presidents Group. Under federal antitrust laws, this organization can collaborate on formulas used to determine students’ financial aid awards. However, the universities are only permitted to collaboratively determine a student’s financial need if the entire group refrains from considering the student’s financial standing during the admissions process. This is referred to as being“need-blind.” The lawsuit claims that nine of the 16 universities included in the group are not truly “need-blind” as advertised. More specifically, the lawsuit claims the University of Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt have considered the financial need of waitlisted applicants. By doing this, they are breaking the promise advertised on theirwebsitesof being a fully “need-blind” institution for domestic applicants. The lawsuit also highlights the fact that other universities that participate in the 568 Presidents Groups give“special treatment to the children of wealthy” donors. Giving special treatment to those who obviously have connections to wealth compromises their “need-blind” approach. Therefore, those who don’t have a monetary connection are often at a disadvantage. While it is frustrating that these elite colleges don’t have an equitable admission process, it is hard to say it is surprising. There have always been connections between wealth and access to higher education, only further heightened in elite private schools. In astudyconducted in 2017, it was found that less than 5% of students at Ivy League and other elite colleges came from the bottom 20% of the income distribution while more than 14% came from the top 1%. The prestigious private universities targeted by the lawsuit are all contributing to a cycle that hurts those who come from lower-income families and other marginalized groups. Even though some of the universities may not directly be participating in the illegal processes themselves, their membership in the 568 Presidents Group upholds the problematic approach to minimizing student aid. The lawsuit refers to the group as the“568 Cartel”due to their highly cruel and — what they argue to be — illegal practices. Moreover, the lawsuit claims that an estimated 170,000 students at the 16 universities have been under-awarded financial aid and are consequently overcharged for tuition. If this eventually proves true, all of these students deserve to be compensated both for the aid they did not receive and for the troubles that may have stemmed from inadequate financial aid. While the students who have been personally victimized must be compensated, more must be done. In order to bridge the higher education gap between wealthy and low-income students, the concept of higher education needs to be reimagined. The price-fixing lawsuit does not represent the first time the college admission process has been involved in legal battles. In the famed 2019“Varsity Blues”scandal, it was found that parents had been paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to a consultant who would ensure their child’s spot at a top university. This scandal proved that those who are financially well-off can buy their spot into elite colleges, yet again showing the disadvantage for those who don’t come from wealthy families. Private and public universities alike must reimagine their budget practices to minimize the costs for all middle and low-income students. This can be done byincreasing taxeson the ultra-wealthy to help fund higher education. In 2014, Germany successfully eliminated tuition costs for all students from the European Union. Similarly, Ireland, France, Norway, Denmark and Sweden do not charge for EU residents. America should look toward these European nations and see that affordable college is possible. Most importantly, colleges and universities must shift their focus from minimizing possible financial aid awards to maximizing their students’ benefits. While many would call this idearadical, it is important to consider the extravagant changes higher education has gone through in the past century. When former President Ronald Reagan was elected governor of California in 1967, he called for a reinvention of the state’s public higher education systems. He would go on to end free tuition at theUniversity of Californiaand cut higher education funding by 20%. His reasoning? Taxpayers shouldnot be responsiblefor “subsidizing intellectual curiosity.” Why not? Why shouldn’t taxpayers be responsible for training the doctors who may treat them, the accountants who manage their finances or the engineers that design their cars? The list goes on. Higher education is necessary for a well-functioning society, and it cannot go undersupported by taxpayers. The federal lawsuit filed against the 16 elite universities further sheds light on the mountainous problems that the U.S. higher education system faces. In order to have a well-educated population and to continue to advance in innovation, the U.S. must minimize the financial burden of higher education. Radical change is not unattainable.

wildcat_arizona_2022_20,"An image of a football player with a dollar sign on his back by Galadriel Gross. In the wake of the University of Arizona theater department’s decision to pause admissions for the 2023-2024 school year, I am left questioning our school’s promise to support its entire student body. Here at The University of Arizona, there is an unbridled sense of school pride. Of course, that pride stems from different areas depending on the individual. Sometimes our major or department is what makes us feel proud to be a Wildcat; others are proud to walk the halls because their parents and grandparents did; a lot of us were also born in Tucson, so we were raised to be die-hard fans. Most of all, athletics are what we fall for, and the university — as an institution and a business — keeps feeding the obsession. The long-lived tradition of overspending in the athletic department continues to undermine the other traditions that make UA worthy of school pride. The first of many recent extravagant spending occurred nearly five years ago. AZCentralreported that, in 2017, the school had a $66 million renovation plan for the football stadium and aquatic center, among others — a renovation that would largely be placed on students to fund in the form of a mandatory athletic fee. Non-athlete students are also paying for athletic development.$100 is charged to each undergraduateper year who is enrolled in at least seven credits. Sure this is not an astronomical amount, but it quickly accrues considering the nearly 40,000 enrolled undergraduates. At the same time, it is a matter of principle. Why is there an athletic fee when there isn’t an arts fee? It is one thing to spend this immense amount of money on sports renovations, and it is another thing to see no improvement in football performance.In 2018— the year the new aquatic center, stadium renovation and training facilities were put to use — Arizona Football scored a total of 376 points compared to an opponent average of 391. Statistics show that,in 2014, before this extreme expense, Arizona’s points totaled 491 when they were above their opponents’ average of 387.Last year, their total points amounted to only 206. I previously understood that our football team was declining, though after reading these specific statistics, I truly wonder why they continue to be funded so heavily when they do not deliver results. There is a multitude of activities in which Arizona excels, such as art, music and UA multimedia, that are just as deserving of more funding. The drastic spending that occurred in 2017 did not prepare the athletics department well for the debt that was to come when COVID-19 hit. In 2019, as well, it was stated that football expenditures had almosttripled since 2004, exceeding the Pac-12 and Power 5 conference averages. Some unfortunate compromises had to be made during the 2020-21 fiscal year when the universityfell short of $45 millionof what they expected to gain from athletics, $19 million of which were substituted by laying off employees and limiting routine expenditures. Athletic students themselves also benefit directly from sports endowments. Starting this fall semester, the university implemented the5980 Academic Fund, which awards student-athletes in exemplary academic standing an annual maximum of $5,980. These funds can be used towards academic-related expenses.Athletic Director David Heeke said, “our “5980 Academic Fund” raises our standards by providing additional resources for Wildcat student-athletes’ academic performance.” Reading about such a substantial opportunity for student-athletes made me wonder if student-artists and musicians had any remotely similar chances. I know that, at the University of Arizona Fred Fox School of Music, the underground practice rooms are not soundproof, nor have they been recently renovated. For that reason, I doubted school support in the music department. The School of Arts itself was not able to comment on financial options provided for arts students, and I also did not find much helpful information on the matter through my own research. However, with a simple Google search for student-athlete financial aid, ample sources appear. This past June, a generous donor gifted the athletic program with$4.8 millionto “support program enhancements for the football and men’s basketball programs as well as the Lute Olson Endowment for Excellence in Men’s Basketball.” To me, there is so much wrong with this picture. A whole separate issue it calls on is the lack of attention women’s sports get, while it seems absurd that this abundance of funding comes from just one individual. An additional$1 millionhad been donated by a couple in 2021 toward the Wildcat Scholarship Fund and Arizona Football. No such results were found with a Google search regarding arts students. What art and music students also lack arepriority registration benefits; athletes are part of the first group to sign up for classes no matter their year.The UA Student-Athlete Handbookstates that they have early registration dates to avoid unforeseen conflicts with practices. Music students, for example, also must meet certain practice times and are expected to have busy schedules. Freelance musician Devin Gardner earned his master’s degree from the UA Fred Fox School of Music and often works with students and professors there today. Through an email interview, he expressed his thoughts on the imbalance of opportunities between music students and student-athletes. “It is no secret that most universities are driven by athletics — people are highly interested in sporting events, and they bring in large amounts of revenue for a school,” Gardner said. “With that, less than two percent of student-athletes go on to play at a professional level.” TheNCAAcan attest to that fact. “For music students , music is their major, something that the individual plans to spend their career engaged with.” He explained to me through email that music scholarships are extremely competitive and that “there are less conveniences financially for the music student population at large.” There are, however,full-ride scholarshipsavailable for graduate wind, brass and string quartet musicians, but little options for undergraduate students who find themselves at a crossroads when deciding what to pursue in college. Gardner ended his email by saying that “It would be wonderful to see more opportunities that are visibly present in music, and the arts in general, to help secure highly motivated individuals to inspire, teach, and guide the next generation.” In agreement with Gardner, I would say that money is the reason sports are hyped up so much. The ad videos, merchandise and booming audio at the games are a huge part of why we keep returning to the stadium. The cyclical nature of athletic revenue and spending seems impossible to tone down any time soon. As fun as the games are and as proud as our teams make us, there are plenty of other deserving student performers at the university who plan on pursuing these activities for the rest of their lives. UA Theater is also at a great disadvantage, one that was fully realized as of Nov. 6. “The College of Fine Arts Administration at the University of Arizona paused recruitment for the BFA Acting/Musical Theater and BFA/MFA Design & Technology degrees for the 2023-2024 school year,” as stated by a new Instagram account calledSave AZ Theater. The non-UA-affiliated account is urging viewers tosign petitionsto aid in keeping the program alive. Aidyn Corkell is a senior studying Theatre Production at UA who expressed their shock at the news, “Not just because the news itself, but because it was leaked to the press before they mentioned it to students and faculty.” according to their email response. Eliza Hitch, a sophomore in the Musical Theatre program, was also shocked and said through email, “It is very frustrating to be in a program that was touted as one of the best of the country, and now the administration clearly does not support it.” Brant Pope, the current Interim Director of the School of Theatre, Film and Television, is aiming to “evaluate the curriculum considering current and future trends in the marketplace and a need to most effectively allocate limited resources within the school and college while maximizing opportunities for student success.” Essentially, “limited resources” are funds and the “maximization” of opportunities refers to the replacement of theatre production with a film-directed focus. Corkell says in his email, “While film and TV are more popular, and I agree that the program should update with that shift, my degree is not worthless and should not be treated as such.” Popeadmiredthe acting and design majors, calling them “excellent and very highly regarded,” though his statement on the recruitment pause was brief. Hitch commented on the statement saying in her email, “we were honestly just left with some very ominous headlines and not much substantive information.” She added that “The plans that the Interim Dean has in the works for the restructured degree programs within the School of Theatre, Film, and Television essentially rip that away — leaving me feeling very vulnerable in a school 2,000 miles from home.” Arts students are left to wonder, contemplate and only hope for stability in their passion, unlike student-athletes who likely never think twice about such matters. Corkell and Hitch, and surely the rest of their classmates, already take risks pursuing their degrees in a world where the economic disparities between professional athletes and artists are plentiful. Hitch mentioned that in their email response, “One of the reasons the administration cites for the discontinuation of the program is that BFA majors do not succeed financially after graduation. That is absolutely not true, and many alums who are working and thriving will tell you so. Eliminating the BFA in Musical Theatre denies future generations of performers the opportunity to learn, grow and thrive here at the U of A.” RELATED:REVIEW: ‘Dance Theatre of Harlem’ in Centennial Hall Corkell expanded on Hitch’s email statement saying, “I know students and alumni in both design and technology and acting and musical theatre to go on to do Broadway, movies, operas, live music, dance and so on.” They said, “It’s important to note that the way we run our theatre fiscally is not the average for most places. We run off of strictly ticket sales, whereas your local theatre is most likely based on ticket sales and donors.” A university theatre program should not be lacking the support of its home school. Students and faculty should be able to sustain their programs, even under less fortunate situations. As much as sports are widely enjoyed here and as much as they fuel our school pride, the athletic department gets the recognition because of the amount of money they are supplied. The cycle continues when that money is then met with more hype from fans through ticket sales and cultural practices like tailgating. It is possible to limit their expenses and appreciate the other successful departments at UA, like music and theatre. If administrators and donors considered the school as more of a community rather than a business, perhaps the funds could be shared. The Fred Fox practice rooms could actually install sound-proof technology; theatre students could be encouraged rather than put down and athletes could continue to build their programs at a fair rate.

wildcat_arizona_2022_36,"A single nug of a 100% Sativa strain of marijuana called “Asian Fantasy” sits in a bowl before it gets broken up to be smoked. April 20 is considered National Weed Day. President Joe Biden issued anexecutive orderon Oct. 6, pardoning all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession, and stated that “no one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana.” Currently, there are19 statesin which recreational marijuana use is legal, and37 statesin which qualified individuals may use cannabis for medical purposes. Although Biden’s scope is limited, his pardons should signal states to put forth reformative policies regarding marijuana decriminalization and legalization. When it comes to the social aspects of criminalizing marijuana use, there is a huge racial gap when it comes to arrests. In fact, Black Americans are3.6 times more likelyto be arrested for cannabis offenses compared to white Americans. Statistics like these show how harmful the war on drugs has been to minority populations in America, and are essential to include when discussing reformation. On top of this, arresting recreational marijuana users cost states over$3 billiondollars in 2010, according to a study conducted by the American Civil Liberties Union. That’s wasted dollars that could have been spent on other areas of improving the criminal justice system. The reasons above suggest that decriminalization and legalization are the logical next steps when it comes to limiting arrests for cannabis use. Between President Biden’s executive order, and the House of Representatives passing the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and ExpungementAct, there is an opportunity for the federal government to intervene with marijuana policy. However, regulations and policies should be implemented at the state level. I recently interviewed Anne Boustead from the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona to get more insight on drug policy and how implementation of reformed marijuana laws could work. When asked about Biden’s pardons and how that will affect state policy, Boustead said that “with regards to the federal prisoners, he has the leeway to make pardons and commutations there, but he only really has the power of the bully pulpit with regards to state convictions, and drug crimes in particular, especially when you’re dealing with possession, are hugely a state level issue.” Based on this reasoning, since there is only so much the president can do, his pardons should signal states to make their own reformations. Having states create their own policies is also a good thing because it encourages somemarket regulation. Boustead said, “legalizing cannabis is one thing, and legalizing cannabis and then letting it be sold in a completely unregulated fashion is something else entirely.” States have greater say over what street corners can have dispensaries, what age is appropriate to purchase cannabis and making sure it is sold away from schools in local communities than the federal government does. RELATED:Cannabis on campus: What’s the deal? Boustead also said, “there was a series of articles for a while that suggested that cannabis legalization might make people consume cannabis instead of opioids.” While this may have been true in the past, the opioid crisis has changed drastically. The opioid crisis has changed from prescription drug abuse to beingdrivenby heroin and fentanyl. The ever-changing trend in these substances and their uses proves that regulation at the state level would be more effective than at the federal level. Local communities that are aware of the specific drug threats within their limits are much more capable of making policy decisions regarding cannabis than federal politicians. States like Arizona have proven that legalizing and decriminalizing cannabis can be safe and effective. In Arizona, the use of marijuana is legal for adults aged 21 and older, but things like smoking inpublicand driving under the influence of marijuana are still illegal. Laws like these and Biden’s pardons can encourage other states to make their own policy reforms on marijuana and begin legalizing its use and possession while also respecting certain regulations. If states were to be influenced by Biden’s political move, it could potentially lower the racial inequality within the criminal justice system, and allow safe and effective cannabis use to exist. Therefore, states shouldn’t stay stagnant with regard to their own marijuana policies, and should instead help end the federal fight for these policies by being involved with their own communities and implementing policies of their own.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_50,"The world’s superpowersagreedto prevent a global nuclear war by avoiding an arms race on Jan. 3. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC — the U.S., U.K., China, Russia and France — signed a joint pledge agreeing that nuclear wars were impossible to win. This pledge from the countries, which hasreportedlybeen in the works for a long time, comes during a period of looming conflict and tensions between the members themselves. This statement is reminiscent of resolutions made by people on New Year’s. Travel more. Eat healthy. Workout everyday. Spend time with family. Organize better. Quit a bad habit. Add another futile resolution to the list: prevent nuclear war. Every year the same cliched resolutions are made in hopes that this may be the year that they finally accomplish their goal. Yet, these promises are notoriously popular only for the month of January; by the end of the year, most folksforgetwhat goals they had originally set. If individuals struggle to fulfill their goals without extreme scrutiny, how can governments be expected to stick to their often performative pledges? But with the immense popularity of New Year’s resolutions, it isn’t possible to simply forget them and not set any goals at all. Sometimes, people are successful in accomplishing their goals; if they work in the public sphere, they may especially share their ideas with their audience and showcase a review of their successes or failures. This notion doesn’t simply apply to private individuals, it applies to governments too. When failing in front of the very people they are accountable to, repeating mistakes should be easy to avoid. However, the UNSC’s permanent members seem to forget that nearly all previous treaties and summits regarding war, aggression and violence have been ignored by membersmultipletimes. Statements tend to be just that: statements. Even though the five nations are the only ones recognized by the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, several othernationsexist that have the power to use their nuclear weapons to begin a conflict, or use it as a means to end one — Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea — while others continue to develop or procure their own weapons. This statement discounts the fact that other nations are attempting to become as strong as the superpowers, and it creates a biased viewpoint for the world’s citizens. This allows them to believe that promising reduction of the risk of war does not terminate ongoing conflicts that are still promoting violence and human rights abuses. If one state refuses to use weapons of mass destruction, another one will. And if the nations were truly dead set on creating lasting and effective changes regarding the risks of war, they would address the root causes of international conflict — resource exploitation and land invasion with multiple rights abuses — and cooperate with one another. However, such sweeping change cannot be implemented unless the countries themselves realize the fragility of pledges. In order to truly reduce the risk of nuclear war and destructive disputes, there needs to be a real, enforceable reduction in the nations’ nuclear weapons stockpiles. Not just to disarm countries that aren’t democracies, but also for countries that have ongoing dissension with their neighbors or those in their regions. Unbiased, third-party organizations need to be able to oversee actual effective action taking place, instead of the people of the world having to wait for “constructive dialogue with mutual respect and acknowledgment of each other’s security interests and concerns” to be an effective measure against the already aggressive actions being undertaken by Russia and China towards their neighbors. As a new year begins, it is time to recognize that words without mass movements or proof of action are just empty letters. Any political promises or pledges without real policy to complement them, international or otherwise, are simply tactics to create temporary and false optimism. Wasting resources in the creation of weapons will not benefit anyone in the long run; to really create lasting effects with international promises of peace, there should be research and time devoted to how nuclear energy can be made usable for the larger public domain. Until then, the only relatability that governments offer to citizens will be their performative enthusiasm for New Years’ goals.Nandini Sharma is an Opinion Staff Writer.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_3,"There is no doubt that the most recentSupreme Court appointmentcarved a landmark in American history as Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson became the first Black woman to earn a seat in the highest court. She has proven herself to behighly qualified, despite the GOP’s aggressive quest tocriticizeher credentials and paint her judicial philosophy as unsuitable. She will remain in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. until Justice Stephen Breyer retires at the start of the summer. The people of the United States could learn a thing or two from Judge Jackson’s hearings alone. Given the amount of interrogation imposed upon her bythe GOP, she endured one of the most laborious confirmation hearings to date. Yet, throughout each and every relentless interrogation, Judge Jackson remained poised and professional. If there are any lessons to be learned, it is that the loudest in the room often have the least to say. In a country that grows more and morepolarizingeach and every day, Judge Jackson is a breath of fresh air. Many would consider a calm, reserved individual to be “the weak one” in a cutthroat, ambitious world — even more so within the political jungle — but her nature alone breaks barriers to this stereotype. Judge Jackson is a symbol of quiet strength. In the face of Sen. Ted Cruz’s questioning about whether or not she supportedcritical race theorybeing taught in schools, she took one, long pause. No uproar, no temper. Even after being confronted with aquestionas atrocious as “do you agree… that babies are racist?” “Senator,” Judge Jackson pauses, sighs, and composes an answer; “I do not believe that any child should be made to feel as though they are racist, or though they are not valued…” This is unique in today’s politics. Politicians like Ted Cruz andDonald Trumpearn praise for their outbursts and offensive rhetoric. To many, specifically the Republican party, they are symbols of strength, even as partisanship in the nation grows. Judge Jackson revives the sense of etiquette that has been lacking in American politics for a while. Friends closest to Judge Jackson note that she was never afraid of the “middle ground.” Instead, she uses this gray area to her advantage. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has the magical ability to listen. To understand that compromise, regardless of its sacrifices, can have the most effective results. She picks her battles. In a world where Black Americans face disadvantage, disparity and injustice time and time again, she understands the importance of hard work in the face of adversity. Whether through silent marching, letters confronting racist journalists or protesting against a Harvard student displaying a Confederate flag on their dorm window, Judge Jackson understands the beauty behind quiet strength, the fine line between the black and white areas of the world. She never lost focus. Even amongst the injustice, she remained focused on her studies and on the end goal. For Judge Jackson, itwas“to go into law and eventually have a judicial appointment.” Of course, she proceeds to do just that. She takes care to bring this philosophy of compromise with her as she journeys through her law career. During her time in the legal field, shebriefedcases for liberal and conservative organizations alike. Members of the GOPfearthat Judge Jackson’s confirmation into the Supreme Court will mean that she would be “soft” on challenging issues. Senators like Ted Cruz andJosh Hawleyare prime examples of this. But even conservative journals like theNational Revieware aware that the arguments made by the Republican party lack any crucial substance. As the partisanship in this country increases, the idea of a Supreme Court Justice willing to compromise on serious issues does not sound unappealing. The ability to work with both sides of the political spectrum is a skill that should be treasured rather than ridiculed. In fact, Judge Jackson might be the very element to bring this country closer together. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is a symbol of not only what American politics, but society could be: an entity of compromise, poise and the willingness to understand. She demonstrates how to lead by example, how even the slightest of movements can make a wave of an impact, and how simply working together creates progress. To start, all we need to do is listen.Jean Bootan is an Opinion Intern for the spring 2022 quarter. She can be reached atjbootan@uci.edu."
ubyssey_2022_10,"Sept. 13, 2022 Written byIman Janmohamed Hi Iman, I’m trying to get on birth control but I’m not really sure of my options. I’m also scared of IUDs. What do I do? Figuring out how to get on birth control can be an absolute nightmare. It’s hard to find information and finding a health care professional can often be difficult. It’s important to consult a health care professional to find what works best for you and it’s invaluable to enter conversations about your reproductive health as educated and prepared as possible. But, for today, I’ve got you covered with a short explainer of some birth control options. Contraceptives can be used for many different reasons — from preventing pregnancy to treating conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis and hormonal acne. However, certain lifestyle factors like smoking can impact what methods of birth control are best for you. Non-hormonal birth control options like the copper IUD, progestin contraceptives like progestin IUDs and the minipill or barrier contraceptives like condoms are safer for people who smoke cigarettes. If you have a personal or family history of blood clotting disorders, hormonal birth control might not be for you, but it’s important to consult a professional. There are a ton of different birth control methods — like the hormonal pill, patch and IUD; or non-hormonal methods like internal and external condoms. Most forms of birth control require a prescription from a doctor or nurse practitioner and can be bought at a pharmacy. The closest pharmacy to campus is Shoppers Drug Mart, but there are tons all over Vancouver. If you want to maximize your AMS/GSS Health & Dental plan, Pacific Blue Cross can save you up to 50 per cent of your out-of-pocket costs if you get your prescriptions filled at a Rexall Pharmacy. The closest Rexall Pharmacy is at 6580 Fraser Street, 38 minutes away on the 49 bus. To get a prescription or learn more, you can book an in-person or tele-health appointment with Student Health Services or at your local health clinic. Some people can try several different brands of birth control pills because individual bodies respond differently to medication. Some side effects of hormonal birth control pills can include nausea, decreased libido, headaches and more. If you are facing these side effects, it’s important to talk to your health care professional and discuss other options that might work better for you. You shouldn’t be taking medication that makes you feel awful. IUDs are probably the contraception method that you hear the most about — be it good or bad. I’ve heard a bunch of horror stories on TikTok about people literally ripping out their IUD, but that is super rare and shouldn’t be a barrier to you exploring this option. IUDs are small t-shaped devices that are inserted into your uterus (and can be removed by a health care professional. There are two types of IUDs — copper IUDs like Paragard IUDs and progestin IUDs like Mirena IUDs. Student Health Servies can prescribe either. The progestin IUD is a hormonal IUD which can last for three to six years and works by locally releasing hormones. Progestin works to thicken your cervical mucus while thinning the lining around your uterus. Hormonal IUDs are over 99 per cent effective according to Planned Parenthood. Copper IUDs last for up to 10 years, are made out of copper (a spermicide and are 99 per cent effective, according to the Mayo Clinic. The IUD kills the sperm before it can reach an egg, effectively stopping a potential pregnancy. Copper IUDs can also be used as emergency contraception when inserted within seven days of unprotected sex, if Plan B, or oral emergency contraception, isn’t an option for you. At the end of the day, I’m just an advice columnist, not a health care professional, so going to see your doctor, nurse practitioner or even visiting Student Health Services or a clinic is the best way to go. You’ll learn about the different types of birth control that are best for your needs and pricing. Deciding what type of contraceptive — whether that’s the pill, patch, IUD or a barrier method — is personal choice. Regardless of what your friends, siblings, parents, influencers or resident advice columnist recommends, you should always consult a doctor and do what feels right. And if a specific birth control method ends up not being right for you, you can always try something new, stop birth control or re-evaluate your options. You’re doing great. Keep it up!

stanforddaily_2022_23,"As students, many of us have committed to addressing discrimination wherever and whenever it occurs. At 5 p.m. on October 21, 2022, at 550 Lasuen, the campus community will have an opportunity to commemorate an important moment in the history of the University in this regard. In 1965, the Alpha Omega Chapter of Sigma Chi at Stanford gave a bid for membership to a 19-year old Black freshman: Keni Washington. Prior to pledging Washington, the National fraternity had placed the local chapter on notice.In a letter sent to Chapter alumni in late 1964,the National had been warned that the House was in crisis because it was “not free to pledge Negroes.” Upon pledging Washington, even after this strong warning, the Chapter’s National fraternity initially suspended the local chapter; the Chapter then voted to leave its National fraternity rather than oblige blatant racial exclusionary policies. On April 13, 1965,the Stanford Daily reportedthe suspension as its lead story, quoting Chapter President Gary Kerns ‘65 who summed up the Chapter’s position: “… we will not give up the pledge to stay in the National ….” Sigma Chi was 110 years old in 1965. Given the national policy, it is unlikely that an African-American student had ever been allowed membership nationally. Sigma Chi’s exclusionary policies were not alone among Greek or other student associations, and many groups’ exclusionary practices extended to other races and religion. In the 1960s, segregation and discriminatory practices were still rampant across the country, at all levels of our society. Although it was commendable that these students were willing to abandon their National fraternity over this issue, what happened next is what stands out as the historical moment for the University. The students took a principled stand and thereby set in motion a chain of events thatchanged the racial exclusionary policies of student associationsat all colleges and universities nationwide. TheNew York Timesbegan reporting on their efforts. Then, on July 27, 1965, America’s most popular weekly news magazine, Look Magazine, ran a 6-page photo story on the efforts of the Stanford students. The students worked closely with the administration of the University, then led by President J.E. Wallace Sterling. The students were not familiar with dealing with national media, soprofessors joinedin to help. These included Robert McAfee Brown, James T. Watkins IV and Victor Palmieri. Montana Senator Lee Metcalf ‘36, himself a Stanford alum,took the Stanford issue to the floor of Congressin 1965, demanding a ruling on whether the fraternity’s behavior had violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act. By the end of 1965, United States Commissioner of Education Francis Keppel issued a directive that educational institutions that allowed segregation in their private student associations would lose federal funding and grants. Commissioner Keppel’s directive forced universities to come into compliance or risk losing funding. As a result, millions of students, in all student associations, were able to freely associate. Stanford’s Historic Sigma Chi House remains the onlyprivatelyowned residence on campus, under a ground lease with the University. Their lease flows from the foresight of founder Jane Stanford who, inamendmentsto the Founding Documents, made clear her intent that in the “future administration of the Leland Stanford Jr. University” the University should “lease lots” for privately built student residences and declared that “the present provisions for leasing lots should be continued…” Stanford’s Historic Sigma Chi House was built in 1938. Since a new ground lease was executed in 1976, the owners (alumni of the Chapter estimate they have invested over$32 million dollars in the property, including the value of the House. At 5 p.m., on October 21, the entire Stanford community is invited to 550 Lasuen to commemorate the members of the Classes of 1965, 1966 and 1967 who took this courageous stand and provided the leadership that has impacted multitudes of students in the intervening years. There are only a fewhistorically designated structureson this campus. The short list includes structures built by the founders (the Stanford Barn , a former U.S. President and his wife (Lou Hoover Henry House and the residence of at least one professor. This commemoration is unique: it honors history created by the University’s students, many of whom will attend the event. At a time when many of us are fighting to create a more equitable society, it is important to stop every once in a while and reflect on successes and victories in battles already won. This is one of them. It will instill an appreciation in all of us that a principled stand, by even a few committed students, can change the world. Reunion weekend will be busy, but this commemoration on October 21, at 5 p.m., is a must-stop for your weekend agenda.

rice_thresher_2022_0,"ByNatasha PatnaikandAngelina Hall11/29/22 11:00pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. The social media app Fizz made its way to our campus earlier this semester, offering an anonymous discussion platform for exchanging messages and memes amongst Rice students. In recent weeks, antisemitic and racist posts were made by members of our community on this app. It is entirely hateful and dangerously intolerant. In our capacities as Teaching Assistants for Critical Dialogues on Diversity, we have often heard genuine surprise at the mere mention of such bigotry or extremism existing amongst our student body. The phrase, “I can’t believe someone who was smart enough to get into Rice would say/do something like that” is all too common. As such, our work and experiences with CDOD, and as Diversity Facilitator Coordinators with the Office of Multicultural Affairs, compel us to share our thoughts on this matter. Make no mistake — these antisemitic posts were created by Rice students and likely posted under the shield of anonymity because these individuals are entirely aware of how completely antithetical these detestable posts are to the inclusivity we try so hard to foster and maintain here at Rice. This is not who we are, and this is not what we stand for. We write this opinion piece, without the cover of anonymity and for all to see, because we firmly believe such hateful views have no place in our community. Although we hope that the moderators (who are also Rice students become more proactive in immediately removing such hate speech and misinformation, we cannot passively wait and hope a select few will address the issue. Aside from any legislative actions or policy proposals the Student Association may create in the future, the onus needs to be on each and every one of us to reject this hateful content. If we are going to be a community that is proud of its Culture of Care, then it is precisely in a moment like this that we must embody that support, respect, and inclusivity for one another. As Rice students, we must show, clearly and unequivocally, that we do not support such bigotry. The easiest way to do so is to stop using the Fizz app and to stop supporting a platform which promotes the rampant spread of such hate speech, targeted cyber-bullying and harassment. We cannot allow this app to detract from the Culture of Care we aim to cultivate here on campus, both in person and online. Actions speak louder than words — and abandoning a platform with a design that lends itself to and encourages the proliferation of such hate speech is the single most effective step we can each commit to. You can get your Rice-related memes and jokes on GroupMe or Instagram — where there is at least some semblance of accountability inherent to what one posts. Our question for our fellow students is plain, simple and unambiguous: is using the Fizz app worth sacrificing our Culture of Care? April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2022_104,"While legacy and athlete admissions dominate popular discourse on inequalities in college admissions — especially thanks to theRick Singerscandal — some “back doors” are more hidden. We often think of “back doors” in the context of generous donations that increase a student’s chance of admission. But there are other “back doors,” like access to competitive public schools and the ability to attend private high schools, that are perhaps the most important factors in securing a student’s spot at an “elite” institution. Wealthy families tend to live in wealthy areas, which in turn pours more money into public high schools in those districts. Take Henry M. Gunn High School (Gunn and Palo Alto High School (Paly , the only two public high schools in the Palo Alto Unified School District in Palo Alto, California. Ranked as two of the best public high schools in California,students at Gunngraduate at a rate of 96%, with an average score of 1410 on their SAT or 32 on their ACT.Similarly, at Palystudents graduate at a rate of 95%, get an average 1380 on their SAT and 31 on their ACT. California’s statewide high school graduation rate is84.3%, over 10% lower than that of both Gunn and Paly.Students also score much loweron standardized tests, with a state average of 1053 on the SAT and 21.41 on the ACT. Students at these Palo Alto public schools perform better — and all for the low, lowmedian housing cost of $3,700,000. Money — and lots of it — grants families access to some of the best public schools in their state. Private high schools in the same area outperform even these competitive public schools. While Gunn and Paly are two of the best public high schools in California, private schools like Castilleja, Crystal Springs Uplands School and The Nueva School are all based in Silicon Valley and rank in thetop-20 high schools in the United States. Students at Castilleja have an averageACT score of 33, and those atNuevaandCrystal Springshave average scores of 34, with similar SAT scores across the board. Theaverage ACT score of a Stanford studentfalls between 32 and 35, a number consistent with the scores at similar universities, so this bump in score from the Palo Alto public schools to private schools could make a significant difference in a student’s college admissions decision. These test scores are likely influenced by the fact that private school students can take these tests with as much paid preparation as they need. And this correlation between income and standardized test scores has not gone unnoticed by those who administer them. Expensive test-prep services — likeBodSatin the Bay Area, which promises to raise its students’ scores “42% of the points remaining to a perfect score” — can cost upward of $150 an hour. And they specifically reach out to private schools: BodSat partners with both Crystal Springs Uplands School and The Nueva School to administer free ACT and SAT diagnostic tests, give presentations to help students better understand these tests and work with teachers to prepare curriculums that align with these tests. In 2016,ACT reportedthat students of parents who earn $80,000 or higher score a 23.6 on average, while their counterparts whose parents earn less typically score a 19.5 — and the gap is widening. Palo Alto’s median household income falls at$158,271, almost exactly double the figure the ACT used. Harvard Law Professor Lani Guinier wrote that,“The SAT is … a wealth test,”and journalist Peter Sacks joked that one could easily guess a student’s standardized test score“by looking at how many degrees her parents have and … what kind of car they drive.”It’s simple: more money almost always ensures a better score. Another perk private schools promise their families is access to specialized attention from college counselors.PalyandCrystal Springsboth have three college counselors— notwithstanding the fact that Paly has over 2,000 9-12th grade students, whileCrystal only has 350. Gunn, also in the Palo Alto school district, haseightguidance counselors for1,908 students, but Crystal Springs still beats them out in terms of counselor-to-student-ratio. This higher counselor-to-student ratio makes the college process easier on the students’ end by ensuring each student has better access to expert advice and elite connections. TakeBrad Ward, former college counselor at Menlo Park’s the Menlo School, who said she’d often think along the lines of, “Maybe I should call Dartmouth again because I haven’t called them in two weeks.” And thisworks. In her hit-piece on private high schools,Caitlin Flanagan concedesthat, while private schools are a gross display of excess wealth and privilege, they succeed at sending their students to prestigious colleges. “Less than 2% of the nation’s students attend so-called independent schools,” she says, “but 24% of Yale’s class of 2024 attended an independent school. At Princeton, that figure is 25%. At Brown and Dartmouth, higher still: 29%.”For Stanford’s class of 2025, that figure is 27%. And these figures are not evenly distributed among U.S. private schools. Back to the Bay Area, Crystal Springs Uplands School sent seven out of around 90 seniors to Stanford in the 2020-2021 admissions year alone. Private schools seem like the perfect place, then, for high-achieving students. The catch? The price tag. Tuition for these Palo Alto private schools, before financial aid, can reach$54,445 a year. If you’re willing to pay, these schools will grant you an “in” to elite universities that even high-performing public schools can fail to give. And it was these types of schools thatSingertargeted. Legally, the process parents and students underwent with Singer was different from the other “back doors” into college admissions. But morally, where do we draw the line between paying $15,000 to have someone take the SAT for your kid, and paying $150 an hour for countless ACT tutoring sessions? Or paying $50,000 a year so your kid can attend a private school that prepares them to be the perfect college applicant? Rick Singer’s “side door” is not new — it merely tested, and found, the limits of the preexisting “back doors.” Sophie Callcott 24 studies History and Archaeology at Stanford.

ubyssey_2022_47,"Nov. 23, 2022 Written byJasmine Cadeliña Manango TheAMS Sustainable Action Plan(ASAP outlines how your student society will improve its sustainability going forward, based on theUN Sustainable Development Goals. The ASAP is divided into six key categories: facilities operations, business operations, advocacy and leadership, student services, campus coordination and Indigenous coordination. Besides outlining how the AMS will practice sustainability, it also states the AMS’s commitment to ethical and sustainable purchasing, including guidelines for licensees, contractors and employers. The facilities operations category of the ASAP is designed to address how the AMS operates the Nest and highlights its plans when it comes to developing projects and partnerships to create more innovative sustainable infrastructure and reduce its reliance on the UBC district energy grid. Key aspects of the plan include reducing energy and water usage; reducing overall waste generation; reducing waste stream contamination; increasing access to sustainable sources of water; and increasing use of energy from renewable sources. The ASAP says the AMS has a commitment to investing and developing zero waste programs. Through the ASAP, the AMS plans on developing plant-based menus and promoting OceanWise food products, while reducing the availability of single-use items and increasing the availability of reusable foodware options. The AMS also wants to transition to local suppliers or suppliers whose collection and transportation methods have a “limited impact on the environment.” The AMS also trains team members in proper waste sorting procedures, according to the ASAP. The AMS plans to advocate for more affordable on-campus student housing and investing in food insecurity-related programs at UBC by using the AMS Housing Service to help students find affordable housing and ensuring that AMS Student Services can support students going through financial hardships, according to the ASAP. The plan also states the AMS should increase its funding and support for student mental health programs. The ASAP uses a peer-support model to advance student mental health and wellbeing. It also mentions improving existing wellbeing services related to equity and inclusion, women empowerment, healthy masculinity, sexuality, substance use and student safety. The ASAP calls for ensuring the continued operation of the AMS Sexual Assault Support Centre. ASAP advocacy and leadership-related goals include creating more accessible physical activity programming and advocating for more accessible and sustainable transportation options at UBC and around Metro Vancouver. The ASAP mentions efforts to continue working on the Dashboard — a software tool used to display sustainability-related metrics at the Nest. The report also states the AMS should create more opportunities for students to provide feedback around sustainability. The AMS wants to work toward increasing the number of applications received for the Sustainable Projects Fund and support both AMS and non-AMS student groups in sustainability efforts. The document also says the AMS should continue its formal partnerships with UBC’s Social Ecological Economic Development Studies (SEEDS and Sustainability Ambassadors programs. Further collaboration with the University Sustainability Initiative and UBC Campus and Community Planning was also encouraged. The Indigenous coordination section of the ASAP was not included in the final report. The AMS stated that it would work with the AMS Indigenous Committee to create the Indigenous coordination section together to include at a later date. The ASAP also mentioned working with UBC to create more programming centered on sustainability. The plan also emphasized working closely with student groups like the Student Environment Center and the Climate Hub. The ASAPs next review will occur in 2023.

wildcat_arizona_2022_61,"A handgun and bullets lying on a table. “Gun violence” by St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office, licensed underCC BY-SA 4.0. In the wake of the horrific school shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, the nation is reeling again. The attack in Uvalde marked the27th school shooting in 2022, but it’s one of over200 mass shootingsthis year. That’s a striking number for any nation, but it’s an all too familiar number for Americans. Gun violence in the United States is a crisis of incredible magnitude. America is one of the only developed nations in the world that experiences such an intense level of gun violence. When compared to developed nations with populations of 10 million or more, the U.S. comes in first for themost homicides caused by firearms. We have dozens of American citizens dying in the streetseveryday, yet the response from our elected officials is apathetic at best and flippant at worst.Recent discussion surrounding gun violence in the Senatefocused on gun-buying restrictions, creating more boundaries between young people and firearms and permitting individuals to flag those who may be a danger to themselves and others if in possession of an automatic weapon. But it is not enough. On Friday, the House of Representatives passed theBipartisan Safer Communities Act, a bill which if signed by President Joe Biden, would be America’s first real attempt at gun control in decades. Yet, the bill still has many loopholes that will not necessarily prevent mass gun violence in the future. Instead, it advocates for much of the same weak reforms lawmakers have been proposing for years now. The kind of background checks and mental health awareness advocacy pushed by many in the Senate will not solve the problem of gun violence. Flagging potentially dangerous individuals will not prevent them from going to their local Walmart and buying the biggest, most dangerous gun they can have. These half-hearted attempts at gun control will not bring back those who lost their lives, nor will they do anything meaningful to halt the loss of life in the future. Firearms in this nation have caused unimaginable pain. As such, they should be taken away from private owners, or at the very least, restricted to the point where private ownership of an assault rifle would be illegal. Private ownership of a firearm is not only more dangerous for the public as a whole given the potential casualties, it is also more likely to lead to homicidein one’s own home. There has been pushback when it comes to non-lethal weapons like tasers replacing traditional guns, at least when it comes tolaw enforcement’s use of stun-guns. In many cases they can be lethal. However, most civilians who own tasers do not ownpolice-grade versions, which can shoot up to 50,000 volts of electricity and deploy up to 35 feet. While still a potentially violent weapon, the taser owned by a civilian can, and in most cases will, disarm an attacker. A weapon such as a taser can help keep its owner safe, which is the point of owning such an object in the first place, without providing the same potential for widespread violence as a gun. If an American has the option to own a non-lethal weapon for their own safety in the face of an attacker or general assault, why would they not take that option? We cling desperately to the Second Amendment while surrounded by bloodshed. Are we so reluctant to change the Constitution to protect the lives of our own citizens? The right to bear arms is a relic of a bygone era, one that saw its people use crude weapons incomparable to today’s firearms. The most common weapon used by domestic terrorists today is the AR-15, which firesthree times the speed of sound. I highly doubt our forefathers would feel so strongly about arming American citizens with such hideous weapons of mass destruction. Freedom is a complicated subject in the U.S. It has many different meanings for each American who hears the word. But, I believe we can all agree that freedom is, if nothing else, the right to life. It is the right to walk through one’s community, school and supermarket without fear of being hunted and killed by a madman. If removing these weapons from the hands of citizens saves the life of even one innocent child, then is that not enough of a push to lay down our guns? We have done more in this nation to protect the presence of assault weapons than we have our own citizens. As talk surrounding gun violence dominates Washington in the coming weeks, my only hope is that our officials will begin to consider the people over the machine. A person’s right to own a gun does not supersede someone else’s right to life. We all deserve freedom, and we all must fight to make that dream a reality.

The Bridge Peer Counseling Center offers counseling by trained students 24/7 at (650 723-3392. The Faculty Staff Help Center, located in Kingscote Gardens, offers confidential help for Stanford faculty and staff. Scroll to read the responses… “It is so easy to struggle in silence here.” — Frosh “The sad truth about mental health at Stanford is that no one really, or truly cares for OTHER people, no no, they re far too busy making sure their name has that big red S next to it.” — Senior “I found a close group of supportive friends here at Stanford, so my mental health has improved massively since I got here. I think I got lucky though, making new friends after NSO ends takes a lot of work.” — Frosh “The campus culture can be very alienating, due to its competitive, superficial environment.” — Frosh “My mental health is good, and I wish more of my students could say the same about themselves. I like working at Stanford, even though it s a stressful environment and I see it as my duty to support students under stress.” — Faculty Member “I’ve been pretty depressed this year but it’s getting better finally… working hard to get my life in place more.” — Junior “Mental health at Stanford is an afterthought. The administration’s neglect is single-handedly responsible for my breakdown. I spent 45 minutes on hold with CAPS during an emergency trying to get help before my parents rushed to get me.” — Sophomore “Not available, not enough.” — Hospital staff member “My mental health is actually far better at Stanford than at home. It s not that I have a bad home life or anything, but I feel like I belong here: I m doing intellectually stimulating work, I m surrounded by people with like interests and goals, and I have more freedom in what I am able to do. I feel like I m living a completely separate life at Stanford. There are two me s, and when I fly back home I feel more like my Stanford self has gone to sleep and my home self has awoken, and similarly for the return to Stanford. That being said, of course taking lots of challenging classes with tight deadlines is stressful. But I get a lot of value from it—it s ‘eustress.’” — Sophomore “I had existing mental health problems and the school has offered some resources. However I feel Stanford should have much more in the way of on staff counselors. The entire law school shares one amazing counselor but she is not able to adequately help several hundred law students. I’m sure other departments could likewise use more dedicated counseling staff.” — Law student “Sometimes it feels like this is a kind of cesspool of anxiety and overwhelmingness, but that no one is willing to vocalize it. I have made a concerted effort to be open with others — I figure if at least one person voices when they re not doing great, maybe someone else will hear it and know that they re not alone in feeling that way. But it s hard; it feels like everyday I have to put effort into simply doing the right things, like getting up, working out, going to class, doing homework.” — Frosh “I called CAPS looking for a therapist during a high-stress time and was essentially forced to wait 2 weeks so I could have a 15-min ‘clearance’ talk with one of their psychs who told me...I should talk to a therapist. It ended up delaying my care in a time when I really needed help. Thinking I had learned a lesson, I tried going to VPGE before Spring Break asking for help with classes amid the suicide/war/COVID trifecta. I felt I needed any sort of crutch or release valve and assumed they would have some way of helping. Their advice? Talk to my professors and tell them I m stressed. They even admitted it felt ‘cold’ but that they had no other resources available.” — Co-term/master s student “The Stanford community often likes to understate the toxicity of ‘duck syndrome’ treating it like the status quo rather than a epidemic facing the campus. The Graduate Life Office even gave graduate students duck stickers essentially trivializing and making it seem like a common occurrence not worthy of additional resources.” — Ph.D. student “I once had a therapist ask me ‘if you had to explain your story in one sentence, what would it be?’ At the time, I didn’t answer; I didn’t know how to. But now, I would quote a line the Lumineers: ‘It’s better to feel pain that nothing at all.” At the greatest institution in the world, I beg to feel pain just to know that I can still feel something.’” — Junior “My freshman year has been a total bust and Stanford has made its resources completely inaccessible to me.” — Frosh “The resources and prominent grief are typically given to undergrads when many graduate students have taken their lives this past year. It is discouraging to not see increased focus on our community when we are Stanford’s students, researchers, teaching staff, support staff and more.” — Ph.D. student “Only experience with the Faculty & Staff Help Center and it was very positive!” — Staff “The mental health resources at the University are abysmal and the competing culture amongst students coupled with overbearing and demanding faculty makes it difficult to reach out for help.” — Ph.D. student “The staff at CAPS have been helpful, but there often seems to be a long wait to access mental health support. I dislike that I feel limited in my options, and that it seems difficult to get long-term care at CAPS. Given the multi-billion dollar endowment, Stanford should be able to provide long-term mental health support for every student at the University.” — Sophomore “No help when we needed it — had to fly out from the East Coast to save my son myself.” — Parent “I went to CAPS my sophomore year after going through the imposter syndrome song and dance. I had gotten to a point where I was considering taking a LOA to figure myself out. It took almost a month to actually see someone at CAPS, and when I finally did, it was a short session filled with condescending looks and cringey conversation. The guy acted like I was shallow for coming to him with my problems. Overall, I left with a bitter taste in my mouth and less self confidence than when I came. Never went back.” — Senior “The goal of the program at the Faculty Staff Help Center appears to be to get you to stop using the center for help. It is not particularly useful if you need help.” — Staff “I struggle a little with mental health at Stanford but I try to keep myself busy to avoid dealing with it. It is probably not very healthy of me but I also am unsure of how else to proceed especially given that schedules are busy and it s hard to make time for it.” — Junior “The problem, I believe, comes from the dominant idea that one should ‘reach out’ when they are feeling in despair. The propagation of romanticization of mental illness is never more prominent than this moment, this, where people truly believe that a person near their breaking point is capable, is present to ask for, or even WANTS help. ” — Senior “Even with more therapists, how do I have time to go to therapy, if I have 10-20 page PSETs due and my grade depends on them? There is little room for failure, too much work, and little support or accommodations. No wonder people are violating the Honor Code. Why would people respect the Honor Code if this university doesn’t respect our time and mental health?” — Senior “I don’t feel supported at all by the mental health resources and staff at Stanford. I think the support they advertise for mental health is all a façade.” — Sophomore “Mental health is talked about all the time, but when it comes to the point where you or someone you know is actually experiencing mental health struggles, the talk is backed by virtually no support. The wait for a CAPS appointment is weeks long, the quality of support there is low, there are little to no accommodations academically (1-2 day extensions do not count , and there is a general expectation that you should be able to push through like everyone else. And you do push through like everyone else.” — Senior “I ve used the Faculty Staff Help Center on numerous occasions and I feel it is an exceptional resource.” — Staff “Pretty positive. I know there are resources if I need them.” — Sophomore “Since being at Stanford, I have realized I have been struggling with mental health issues. It became concerning to me to find that there are little to no resources available on campus. Stanford preaches accessibility to mental health, but in reality it has been incredibly difficult for me to find those.” — Sophomore “I ve never experienced a place that talks the talk so hard but can t begin to walk the walk. It s really saddening, and it s ultimately perpetuated by the school s administration (*athletic and academic administration .” — Senior “I got upset and hung up on the crisis line. They didn’t call back or follow up in any way. I don’t feel at all supported or have any trust in the mental health resources Stanford provides.” — Co-term/master s student “I ve been battling depression and anxiety, admittedly pretty silently. I feel lucky to have a strong support system at Stanford and at home, but it s still easy to feel alone sometimes. Lately I ve been trying to put less pressure on myself and recognize what s really important, but I ve realized that can be easier said than done. I love it here, but it s still easy to feel down — especially when you know that so many people around you are struggling silently, too.” — Junior “As a staff member, I sometimes feel lost in the mix. With everything going on in the world with the pandemic, war, climate change, cost of living, etc., it s increasingly difficult to ‘put on a happy face,’ so to speak, and be there to support the students and faculty that I am here to support. And I feel there isn t acceptable room to take days off for mental health reasons. I ve only been at Stanford for about a year, and I m not even sure what, if any, resources are there to support me.” — Staff “Very poor. Twice over my nearly 30 years at Stanford I sought help for depression through CAPS. The first time, the counselor wanted to attend a staff party, so brushed me off/ended my session early (yes, she actually had the nerve to tell me that she wanted to get to the party . The second time (many years later , I was told that all I had to do was not to be sad and everything would be okay (yes, I am paraphrasing .” — Staff “Mental health in student athletes is complicated. We might seem like we are thriving as All Americans and hardworking, dedicated students. However, underneath some of us are dealing with anxiety, identity crises, stress, and burnout. Personally, I ve dealt with burnout and being let down by Stanford Athletics. Many people have come to me and said ‘How are you a captain, VP of your organization, and also actively involved in the national athletic board?’ All I can say is that I m a workaholic and keep myself busy so that I can cover certain issues I m dealing with. Stanford s resources are there, yet, they don t seem appealing nor approachable. Some of us try to deal with our issues on our own and are afraid to seek resources. I ve never used sports psychology resources as I ve heard more negative than positive reviews. Stanford broke my trust when they cut our team in June 2020. Why should I seek help from them and trust them with my health now?” — Junior “I had to take a leave of absence because of my mental health. I didn t have proper support for mental health services, and the CAPS appointments would take months before it was my turn. By the way, I was admitted for nearly committing suicide, so this scared me because I am not trying to diminish anyone s suffering, but I figured that students that have gone through a situation like this would get immediate attention afterwards.” — Frosh “I ve found that I often keep myself moving too fast to notice if my mental health is deteriorating. But I can usually tell when my hair starts falling out.” — Sophomore “At times — many times it has been difficult to stay focused on a single task. Making sense has also been difficult to the point where I m constantly questioning my intelligence or lack of intelligence. Many days of having absolutely no energy, eating comfort food way too much because I will have control of that and not mental control to stop it. There s more and wonder when will this end.” — Staff “My mental health has never been worse. Being at Stanford made me realize just how bad my mental illness had gotten, and just how out of my control it was. The environment is extremely competitive, and on top of it all no one talks about how difficult it is just to be a Stanford student. I have some days where I cannot get out of bed, and on those days I feel like I don t belong here, because I cannot measure up to my perceptions of my classmates. My depression, my anxiety and my eating disorder have never had more control over my life. But, I also have immense privilege. I have a family that does not stigmatize mental health. I have access to a therapist outside of Stanford, so I don t have to wait for appointments and I can get help from someone who understands my unique situation during times when I am in crisis. On top of that, my insurance actually covers the majority of my therapy bill, so I can go once a week, which I desperately need. It also covers my anti-depressants, which I was able to be prescribed by a board-certified psychiatrist. My mental health is bad, but because of my privilege I have access to a wealth of resources, resources which I know many of my peers do not have access to.” — Sophomore “I have found that access to on-campus counseling resources can be extremely limited and difficult to arrange. CAPS often requires screenings with multiple people before students can access an actual one-on-one therapy session, and many students simply cannot wait multiple weeks before they talk to a professional. Especially in an area in which so many services are incredibly expensive, it is essential that Stanford make mental health care not only easily accessible, but also effective and long-term if needed.” — Frosh “I have some sympathy for Stanford because I know it must be difficult to provide mental healthcare for our large and diverse student population. But if Stanford cannot provide that care, they must provide pathways to resources that can provide that care. If CAPS has wait times, students should be directed to other therapy or psychiatric healthcare options. If a student has a broken bone and Vaden doesn t have any appointments, we don t tell the student just to wait three months. We tell that student to go to urgent care or another hospital in the area. Why not the same for mental healthcare? By lacking these resources, or supplying imperfect resources, Stanford constantly tells us our mental health just doesn t matter that much.” — Sophomore"
crimson_2022_28,"Just last week, a University report called on Harvard to expand its climate change offerings by hiring new faculty and staff in the field and establishing a standing committee to direct the school’s efforts. This framing is apt, correctly recognizing Harvard’s unique place as an institution empowered with both teaching future leaders and setting national precedent for how other academic institutions should prepare their students for a rapidly warming world. Yet, to truly make a difference, the quality of the University’s climate pedagogy must match the ambition of its investments. This past June, Harvard announced its plans to use a recent $200 million donation toestablish the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability. The magnitude of the investment, then, is there. But is the direction? There are two dominant approaches to tackling climate change. The first strategy,mitigation, focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions today to minimize the adverse effects of global warming tomorrow. This approach is necessary. It is also privileged, favoring those communities that have already benefited from dirty development enough that they may shift their gaze from growth in the present to preservation for the future. Conversely, the other approach — adaptation — shifts the focus to preparing countries for the current and future effects of climate change through preventative steps such as reducing disaster risk, ensuring access to freshwater supplies, and adjusting agriculture to include more drought-tolerant seeds. This is the most urgent task for the developing world: To find ways to cope with increasingly severe climate impacts that will hit them disproportionately hard. In the fight against climate change at Harvard and beyond, however, there is a tendency to take “sustainability” to mean mitigation while losing track of the necessity for adaptation. This is a problem. According to the United Nations, striving for sustainabilityrequiresthat we “meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” When it comes to saving the world, mitigation and adaptation both play important roles. Yet, when it comes to Harvard’s climate offerings, the former clearly takes center stage. Harvard currently offers a broad range ofscience and policy coursesfocused on mitigation from the perspectives of biological and physical science, Government, and Economics, among others. By contrast, just three Environment Science and Public Policy courses offered this year address the importance of adapting to the unique environmental challenges that climate change poses for the developing world. One, a junior seminar on “Addressing the Global Climate Crisis: Challenges for Both Developed and Developing Economies,” currently only includes 14 students. The other two, titled “Water Resources in Developing Countries” and “Solid Waste in Developing Countries,” respectively, seek to address narrow — albeit important — topics. This limited coverage cannot by itself provide students with a holistic, comprehensive picture of the many challenges climate change will pose to the developing world. Adaptation, specifically focused on applications for the developing world, deserves a bigger slice of Harvard’s pedagogical pie. The cruel irony of the climate crisis — that developing countries havehistorically contributed the least to global warmingbut will suffer the most from its effects — makes this change a moral imperative. Rich countries have built a hill atop colonialism, natural resource extraction, and environmental degradation. Now, we sit on it and look out at the horizon, watching the world below us burn. Learning about the ways that real human needs — from all corners of the globe — are harmed by a degrading environment is a fundamental precursor to building a more sustainable world. If Harvard truly wants to respond to offer a more comprehensive climate education, this is the philosophy that must pave the way. Other universities are starting to step up to the plate.Yale, for instance, offers focus fields within an Environmental Studies major that allows students to explicitly study sustainable development or environmental justice. As more institutions of higher learning follow suit, Harvard’s choice to disregard these emerging fields will turn from oversight to negligence. The recently-published University report is right: Harvard needs to expand its climate-related offerings. That involves vision as much as it involves resources. Hopefully, the new Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability will be a bold first step towards a sustainable world rather than just a sustainable Boston. Climate change is a shared problem.

This piece, which originally adorned a royal palace in Asia, contains 15.9 kg of 18-karat gold and is set with 26,649 gemstones. With the cooler weather, the streets of Tucson are bustling with more people than usual. As people visit the open-air art markets and many culinary delights of Downtown Tucson, they may find themselves unsure of where to go next. To that end, I recommend anyone with the time and access to downtown visit the University of ArizonaAlfie Norville Gem & Mineral Museum. Housed in the historic Pima County Courthouse, the gem and mineral museum has a new location. Longtime residents of Tucson and rock enthusiasts may already be aware that despite the new home in the Historic Pima County Courthouse, the museum has been around the universitysince 1893. The current museum’s existence has a romantic origin story. The namesake of the museum, Alfie Norville, was a passionate advocate for education regarding gems and minerals. Following her death, her husband Allan Norville helped to bring about the current version of the museum to immortalize and continue her work for all to see. Alfie Norville was instrumental in founding theGem and Jewelry Exchangeand keeping the yearly gem and mineral festival in Tucson. In order to do justice to such a historic institution I knew so little about, I called Jordan Halter, the guest services coordinator for the museum, to ask her more about it. When I asked her on the phone about this “hidden gem,” she feigned offense at the use of the label, saying that “gems aren’t meant to be hidden; they’re meant to be on display.” As a lover of both history and shiny rocks, I just had to see the display for myself. The first thing you should know about the museum is that it’s deceptively large. Admission is reasonable for the size of the collection in the museum, as students are able to get in for only $5. Admission is also come and go, which is perfect because in order to see everything, you’ll need ample time and calories. To address the latter, you’ll benefit from the fact that the tastyFive-To-Oh! Coffeeshop is right next door to the museum entrance. I had hoped to write descriptively about my experience exploring the extensive galleries and displays of the museum, but the experience was nothing short of overwhelming. There were thousands of gems to observe, many of which seemed more fit for the eyes of royalty than a mere mortal such as myself. Furthermore, the gems on display were surrounded by precious minerals and metalwork that would shame most modern jewelers. While I was personally blown away by all of the smoky quartz on display, Halter recommends you take some extra time to appreciate the Paraiba Tourmaline. The collection is incredibly impressive, and even more impressive is how knowledgeable the staff is about said collection. When walking through the halls of the exhibits, I was greeted by numerous volunteers who seemed just as interested in the exhibits as myself. Many times I had the pleasure of walking into a room to a sight that would give pause to even those volunteers who see it far more often than myself. Halter identified herself as the originator of the program that brought in over 25 docents to roam the floor sharing their experiences with interested guests. I enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about the shiny spectacles before me from people with inside experience, often either as jewelers or collectors in their time. In addition to the inside experience that they bring, Halter informed me that the docents all undergo a standardized orientation process so every volunteer will be able to provide an enriching experience for guests regardless of their background. RELATED:A collection for the community: UA museum offers new opportunities for learning One thing I found myself appreciating about the museum was the way in which an experience is curated with science front and center every step of the way. The museum itself is organized in a way that follows the chronology of the discovery of certain minerals. Furthermore, the displays take great care to show all aspects of the process, from the formation of the crystals to their removal from the ground via different mining methods. Halter described the gallery curation as turning “science into art” in a way that allows the ancient tradition of being fascinated by crystals to continue. It is rare to walk through a museum that is able to use gallery design to organically educate visitors on the scientific processes underlying the gorgeous specimens on display. Many displays even encourage active participation providing visitors the opportunity to compare minerals by their touch and see their different applications. The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. When I visited, I observed parents visiting with their children, couples on dates, friends hanging out and retirees leisurely exploring. As such, I don’t think it would be unreasonable to say that there is something for everyone. With the frequently rotating exhibits, as much as 30% per year according to Halter, be sure to go as soon as you can so you don’t miss out on their current displays!

ubyssey_2022_30,"April 13, 2022 Written byStephanie Okoli As the mud smudges the bottom of my shoes. I can’t help but think about my old neighbourhood. How we all played tag and hilarity would ensue. Now some of us are lost. But I pray the rest of us are good. How we got lost is mostly no fault of our own. We trusted in our guardian angels, knowing they saw us as devils. But it is what it is, so life went on. When one exists in the shadows, it becomes the only light they’ve ever known. But I exited the void and realized what our reality was. Now survivor’s remorse strikes my chest every time I think about you guys. Because I feel like I should’ve done something. Because I ran away when I saw their veil rise. These days I smoke near the trees and try to make sense of it all. I don’t know if I’ll ever come back, but I’ll at least try to call. I miss you. I miss the way your warm fingertips trailed down my spine. How your loudest tone was a whisper. We’re polar opposites, you and I. I’m loud, you’re quiet. I’m affectionate, you’re distant. That’s why we didn’t work. Vancouver is still lousy without you. I wonder what you do now. You don’t rap anymore. You should’ve made a song about me. How the Nigerian girl from Calgary And the Jamaican boy from Toronto met in Vancouver. Both grasping for something. While running away from everything. The palm trees etched beside your eye stay in my mind. The twists in your hair put a smile on my face. I wish I could’ve made you smile. Or at least, made you laugh. Oreo, your name is assuming, It shows your character. A sister on the outside But a wolf on the inside. You’re scared of your own, because you’re scared of yourself. I wanted to help you, Not that you wanted it. A ghetto girl from the hood, helping the tortured “genius” didn’t sit right with you. So you beat me, berated me And when I struck back, you called the police. You wanted me dead. But now, you’re dead to me. The bullet smiles as it pierces your skin, It twists and turns through your flesh, Laughing. “Got you!” The bullet said. The springs in your hair crumple as you hit the ground. “Junior!” said your mother. Her knees scraped against the carpet at your wake. Aunties raced to embrace her but, Who could comfort her? Society failed you. Finding a gun was easier than finding an education. Life wrapped weights around your ankles, and Pushed the finish line further away. We weren’t cool like that but, In my mind, you were supposed to be here forever. Instead, they stole you from this earth. Lord have mercy. Length, inches, curls! They dance around in your mind. When will my hair grow? Shrinkage infuriates me. My curls retreat to my scalp as soon as water touches it. “Love us and we’ll grow,” my coils say. “Ignore us and we’ll grow. Cut us and we’ll grow. Be patient!” I lie awake in my room Yearning for better days. Longing for the days where I’d smile so much that my face hurt. Laughing until I couldn’t breathe. You took that away from me. Day by day, Year by year Anxiety crept in Depression followed. I called the police after ten years. A glimpse of solace etched over the horizon. Maybe now, I can rest.

state_press_2022_58,"With seasonal depression being a real and trending part of college students lives, ASU needs to improve their counseling because honestly students are tired of the therapists telling them to get medicated. Withreports of extensive wait timesand negative interactions, ASU Counseling Services needs reform as soon as possible. These consistent issues point to a demand for more staffing and proper training to adequately address mental health issues faced by the student body. This issue becomes even more vital to address as we begin fall and approach winter, andSeasonal Affective Disorder, commonly known as seasonal depression, is triggered by the change. Seasonal depression affects roughly 5% of Americans every year. Not to mention, the onset age ranges from 20-30 years old. For students of ASU, many of whom fall into this age range,the stress of the end of the semestermay not be the only issue they face. ASU offers counseling servicesavailable 24/7 at no cost, according to its site. Upon arrival at theASU Counseling Servicespage, bold letters spell out We re here for you. Anytime, anywhere. This is a message recently reciprocated by the ASU Police Department, whichtweetedearlier this month YOU DON T HAVE TO FACE IT ALONE, encouraging students to reach out to ASU Counseling Services.But for those who have, this claim seemingly falls flat. Believe it or not, we ve made it to#MidTermseason!We know this time of year can get stressful, but YOU DON T HAVE TO FACE IT ALONE!If you re feeling overwhelmed, reach out to#ASUCounseling👉https: t.co/VmUDRMbFUP.Good luck#SunDevils. YOU GOT THIS!#ASUPolice🔱🚔pic.twitter.com/y07Hf9f96u For Catie Green, a freshman studying nursing, visiting ASU s free counseling service was far from easy. After scheduling the soonest in-person appointment, which happened to be weeks out, Green was not satisfied with her visit. I went in to speak to a real person in that moment. (ASU Counseling Services gave me the information for a support group and dismissed me, Green said. I think they just wanted to push me out the door. READ MORE:ASU Counseling Services a bridge to getting long-term mental health help After seeking help from two different staff members of ASU s Counseling Services, Phineas Hogan, a freshman studying journalism and mass communication, considered his interaction a failure. After a two-hour process with paperwork, all I gained was a phone number. When I called the number, they had no counselors available, and I had to reschedule again, Hogan said. When they called me a few days later, I had a 12-minute call with some person who was in Atlanta, they just told me I needed to get medicated. READ MORE:Students see month-long wait time for counseling services ASU Counseling Services notes that they serve 75,000 students, which is almost all of the ASU students who attend on-campus. In 2022, ASU hitnew recordenrollment with a total of 79,232 in-person students. According to ASU Counseling Services Meet The Team page, there are currently 23 counselors, three counseling interns and eight practicum counselors. This equates to about one counselor for every 2,330 students. It s easy to tie this evident understaffing issue to the inability of students to quickly schedule appointments. ASU Counseling Services did not respond to a request for comment. As easy as it is to get stuck on the faults of ASU Counseling Services, something has to be done. Sammy Cristerna, a peer outreach specialist for ASU Counseling Services, offered advice on what could be done to help solve the issue of timelinessbut also drew attention to the problem of balancing this timeliness with already overworked counselors. Time is super, super important when it comes to a mental health crisis … adding more counselors to the team could help fix the problem, but that s hard to do when they re overworked, Cristerna said. As someone who has thought about reaching out to ASU Counseling Services, hearing so many negative experiences from other students has unfortunately deterred me from meeting with them until changes have been made. ASU should prioritize hiring more counselors and ensuring those counselors endure training that will allow them to offer advice that will truly help students during times of crisis. When students are facing mental health issues, timeliness is the most important factor, and ASU needs to take that into account. Next time the weather has me feeling blue, I hope I can feel comfortable reaching out to ASU s Counseling Services, but I don t see that happening until there have been necessary adjustments.

stanforddaily_2022_54,"When Lorde released her third studio album, “Solar Power,” last August, I was underwhelmed. Like Lordeherself, I had expected this release to be a “big acid record” — showing up the synth angst of “Pure Heroine” and the museum magic of “Melodrama” with the shock and awe of a meteor shower. Instead, we got a first single that many found fitting for atampon commercial. The intense instrumental breakdowns of tracks like “Glory and Gore” and “Supercut” were replaced by a leisurely 12-string guitar and a voice like farmer’s market honey. Like its eponymous song, “Solar Power” instead turned out something like a “weed album.” It was playful. Meandering. Mild, even. While some complained that they were still too caught up in their “Melodrama” eras to appreciate this album, I felt like I hadn’t even gotten past “Pure Heroine.” I was the overgrown suburban child who still drank orange juice and cried about growing up. Meanwhile, a 25-year-old Kiwi was telling me to get a grip. Not every song had to strike you to the bone, not every day would feel like cataclysm and not every day was a tick on a time bomb. Most of the time, Lorde seemed to say, life wasn’t so extreme. As the kind of intense person who could never quite land the “cool girl” act, it was hard for me to learn to be temperate. I’d long been familiar with debilitating grief, totalizing sadness, all-consuming infatuation; but I didn’t know the grey emotions, the stretches between those poles. This year, I spent a lot of time in grey. Scholarships I’d poured every last drop of myself into seeped through my hands. People I’d loved unconditionally established their conditions. Nothing on this campus felt the same as when we’d left it, no matter how hard we tried to pretend we could refurbish a ghost town. But the sun stuck around a little longer. The music returned. It wasn’t miraculous, but we found our footing again. Granted, long-term memory and I aren’t on the best of terms, but it’s impossible to locate a few favorite senior year memories. It didn’t feel like that — moments of sorrow, then moments of elation. It felt like ballooning into new spaces between all those words that used to classify then, now, later. I used to think that anything good had to be tumultuous. I wanted art to arrest me, and I wanted to feeleverything.Senior year was supposed to pack all the punch of a swig of Italian liquor. Perhaps to spite me, it instead took notes from “Solar Power,” which I’m now growing to love. I had spent so long curating chaos in my life to accommodate my obsessive need for melodrama, but as it turns out, resisting getting older gets old. It’s actually quite beautiful to realize that adolescent turbulence is not a prerequisite for feeling alive. You don’t have to be fundamentally altered by something for it to be good for you. You don’t have to seek catharsis in every sunset. You don’t have to milk every second for what it’s worth. I’ve never claimed to be wise, and I certainly won’t do so now. But if there’s anything I wish I would’ve understood sooner, it was that my life doesn’t have to have a perpetual coming-of-age-film ethos to mean something. I’m going to be “becoming” forever, long past the expiration dates the entertainment industry loves setting for women, and long past the lingering sense of loss I still feel now. I’m going to experience as much stillness as I will tumultuousness, and both will matter. As I sat — pen and pad in hand and seat heater on — at my first San Francisco movie premiere freshman year, I remember thinking how surreal it was to be a student journalist. As I wobbled in a rickety swivel chair at the Daily building typing and retyping print headlines years later, I remember thinking the same thing. Just because a moment isn’t glamorous doesn’t mean it won’t glisten, and when I shuffle through my memories of this place, I see a luminous haze.

crimson_2022_90,"For the three months leading up to my acceptance to Harvard, I was completely, 100 percent sure I was headed to Yale. During those three months, I spent a lot of time imagining my future in New Haven. One recurrent theme: I would double major in something in the sciences and something in the humanities. The idea of double majoring was exciting; I enjoyed everything I was doing in high school, and I loved not having to choose just one path forward. Then I chose Harvard. The only disappointment was that Harvard had joint, rather than double, concentrations. I knew how difficult it would be to blend science and humanities concentrations into a single cohesive thesis, a requirement of Harvard’s joint concentration program. So I didn’t even try. I had more experience in the humanities, which seemed like a natural place to start at a new school. I took four humanities courses my freshman fall and fell in love with the History and Literature concentration. I was happy; I had a path. Until I didn’t. I rediscovered my interest in science this past summer and fall. I found myself wondering why I had needed to rediscover it, why I had ever stopped taking science classes in the first place, why I hadn’t taken them as a freshman at Harvard. As a senior in high school, I had particularly enjoyed a Molecular Biology Research class and told people I was considering doing an MD/PhD. Four months later when I arrived at Harvard, the possibility of pursuing that path was no longer on my mind. I needed a path that was different from what Harvard offered me. I needed Harvard to show me that there was a purpose and place for my dual interest in science and the humanities. I needed Harvard to show me that it was possible to read Catullus and make pedigree charts, to study the historiography of the Civil War and find the pH of a solution, at the same time. But instead, the implicit message I got from Harvard was that I either had to choose one, or combine both. So I chose one. I want to be clear: I do not regret my choice. If I could go back and redo it, I would still make the same decision. I just wish I could have done it alongside science courses. You must be thinking: No one restricted your ability to take both humanities and science classes. You could have tried it. You should have tried it. And you’re right. I should have. But I was 18 years old. When I selected my courses for freshman fall, I had lived away from home for a total of five days in my entire life. I didn’t know how to do this whole “college” thing yet. I looked to my institution to guide me, to show me what was possible, to provide a path forward. And when the path that Harvard provided looked different than the one I had imagined, I figured I was the one with impractical ideas. A policy permitting double concentrations would send a very specific — and much needed — message to students like me who are interested in multiple subjects and are wondering whether it is possible to simultaneously study the humanities and STEM. Faculty critics of the proposal for double concentrations have suggested that double concentrations will just be another source of stress and pressure on students, who will feel like they have to get that extra line on their resume if provided the opportunity to do so. We may be young enough to need our institution to provide us a path forward, but we don’t need to be protected from our own ambition. That feels infantilizing; that’s not your role. Provide opportunity; don’t take it away. Yes, some students may feel that pressure, but an institution like Harvard, which is devoted to the pursuit of knowledge at the highest levels, should not be basing institutional decisions on the fact that there may be a few students here for the wrong reasons. You should be creating policies to help students who are hungry for knowledge, who are curious and excited to explore the liberal arts — students who love learning and want to know that there is a place for them and their interests at this institution. If the faculty ratifies the currentproposalfor double concentrations, I’m excited to declare a second concentration in Human Developmental & Regenerative Biology. But it’s too late for this policy change to have its full impact on me. Because to me, the purpose of this policy is not an extra line on my resume. The purpose of this policy lies in what it tells 18-year-olds who are curious and hungry and excited to explore Harvard about the possibilities that exist here, who need to see that what they seek in their Harvard education is possible and institutionalized. To the faculty with a vote on the policy: Give the next generation of science-loving humanists, and humanities-loving scientists, a path forward. Give us a tangible acknowledgement that we don’t have to change, that we can and will be able to do both concurrently. Show us this when we are impressionable 18-year-olds, new to Harvard and to adulthood, and then let us experience the profound intellectual discovery that will follow. Very infrequently does such a simple policy change have the potential for such a significant positive impact on students. Vote in favor of the proposal for double concentrations. Give students another path forward and 50 years from now, your decision will still be having an impact. Orlee G.S. Marini-Rapoport ’23-’24, a Crimson Editorial Chair, is a History and Literature concentrator in Adams House."
wildcat_arizona_2022_41,"A candle light vigil was held for Thomas Meixner on Oct. 7 at Old Main on the University of Arizona campus. Speeches by President Dr. Robert C. Robbins, Meixner’s brother-in-law and others helped to memorialize the professor’s life. OnWednesday, Oct. 5, the University of Arizona Police Department received a call around 2 p.m. asking for a 46-year-old former graduate student to be removed from the John W. Harshbarger building on campus. By the time police were on their way to the building, professor Thomas Meixner had already been shot. The suspect had fled the scene before the arrival of police and was apprehended about three hours later just north ofMexico. This was not the first time faculty voiced concern about the shooter, Murad Dervish. According to a complaint filed with the Pima County Justice Court, the 46-year-old had been expelled last semester as a former graduate student as various emails were sent reporting hisprior harassmentand threats to staff members back in February. Following this, an exclusionaryorderwas filed out against him, warning UA of his concerning behavior. This wasn’t the first warning sign, though, as Dervish had a history of criminal violence. He was charged with domestic violence in San Diegoin 2011, as well as a stalking and harassment case that same year by a female student where he was teaching. At this time, possible links and motives from Meixner to Dervish are unclear. Here’s what we do know. It is not normal to receive a message from your campus alert system that there has been a shooting in one of our own buildings. It is especially not normal to feel as if these alerts are a part of our regular routine here on campus — as so many of us do. To label these frightening and concerning events as “abnormal” is an understatement. As gun violence in the state of Arizona grows, we can no longer afford to shrug it off as a “tragedy” or “unfortunate” or everything else in between. We can no longer afford to accept this as our new normal. This is not normal. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey released a statementon Twitteron Oct. 5 regarding the shooting. “Arizona is praying for the family and friends of the professor and those affected by today’s tragedy in Tucson,” he wrote. The Arizona governor has flip-flopped on his view of gun control measures in the past — specifically regarding red flag gun laws. Ared flag lawallows for family members or law enforcement to place an order to temporarily prevent someone in crisis from accessing guns. In order to put the law into use, there needs to be a complaint. “If the U of A had brought or somebody would have brought this to us and said this guy has a history of threats and should not be possessing a firearm, and went so far as to get orders of protection against this guy, we would have run with that case,” Tucson city councilmember Steve Kozachiktold Kold News 13. It’s hard to read statements like these without feeling an incredible sense of frustration. What could have been done, what should have been done. Now, it is up to UA to examine why these reports were not received with as much urgency as they should have been. It is up to everyone to not be passive when acts of such violence occur. We must instead involve and educate ourselves on local gun laws as well as be thoughtful and intentional about who we vote into office. RELATED:Update: Statement from the family of Thomas Meixner Meixner’s impact on both the UA and those who knew him is both immense and lasting. The beloved head of hydrologic and atmospheric sciences, Meixner began teaching at UA in 2005. From here, he went on to passionately dedicate both research and time into his field.In a statementmade to theDaily Wildcat, Meixner’s family said he described his work as, “making the world better through biogeochemistry.” As students — as people — we cannot allow prayers to suffice for such senseless, preventable acts of violence. We cannot allow a singular day of canceled classes or a link to a mental health service website to be a substantial stand-in for what we have lost — far more importantly, what the Meixner family has lost. There is a wife missing her husband, sons missing their father. There is a student sitting in their lecture hall this week who cannot focus on the class as their mind races with a million “what ifs.” We are all that student in some sense or another. The Meixner family statement released a quote that Meixner retweeted recently. “Hope is not optimism, which expects things to turn out well, but something rooted in the conviction that there is good worth working for.” It is time for us all to do away with optimism and acceptance. As students, we cannot expect change — we must demand it. In these times of grief, uncertainty and anger we should ask ourselves this, “What are we working for?” Let us find the good.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_27,"By now, we have likely all been made aware of, if not already fanatical participants in, the “Euphoria” craze. The second season of the hit HBO series, written and directed by Sam Levinson and starring Zendaya alongside a cast of young Hollywood’s most promising break-out stars, has garneredmore critical acclaim and mainstream hypethan any television show in recent memory. “Euphoria” doesn’t shy away from controversial or taboo subject matter — rather, that is the show’s entire impetus. The show’s graphic depictions of teen drug use and addiction, sex, and violence are aesthetically delicious and sensually hypnotic. The show itself is drug-like in its addictive and sedative nature. Its cinematography, color gradation and use ofnon-linear storytellingmakes the viewer feel like they’re in a fever dream. It’s basically Gen Z catnip. Strikingly beautiful and elaborately made-up adult actors portray high school students, whose everyday classroom attire consists of cutting-edge, designer fashion and barely-there garments that would certainly warrant a dress code and detention slip at any real high school. But at Euphoria High, anything goes. The simultaneous, interwoven plotlines propel the narrative forward, with dialogue that is equally smart as it is provocative. However, there is a growingconversationover whether “Euphoria,” in its aesthetic appeal combined with its extremely sensitive and adult material, is unsuitable for teen audiences. The Drug Abuse Resistance Education program (D.A.R.E. has voicedcriticismof the show’s depiction and glorification of drug abuse and other high-risk behavior. D.A.R.E.was established in 1983 as part of the Reagan-era initiatives to clamp down on drug abuse, acting as an extension of theWar on Drugs, along with the “Just Say No” campaign aimed at the youth. It has served, at least in theory, to equip schools — from grades kindergarten to high school — with educational strategies to help children and adolescents resist the peer pressure of drug use, operating on a “zero-tolerance” philosophy. The program isregarded by and large as a failure, costing almost a billion dollars annually in taxpayer dollars during its peak in the 1990s with verylittle evidenceto support its efficacy. Many critics of the initiative argue that its use of law enforcement officers to lead classroom discussions, highlighting punitive consequences for substance abuse over rehabilitative education, was also a reason for its failure to reach teens. Since the program’s inception, rates of drug and alcohol consumption have steadily risen among high school and college-aged students. This is already shaping up to be a losing battle for the organization against television’s currently most talked-about series. In the same way that D.A.R.E. programs in schools ultimately backfired across the nation, its criticisms of “Euphoria” are also likely to do the opposite of their intended effect. We now know that attempts to shield teens from these issues and fear tactics only lead to more curiosity down the line. It is difficult to imagine how a person, regardless of age or maturity, could sit down to watch an episode of “Euphoria” and come away with a desire to experiment with or abuse drugs. After watching the show’s main protagonist Rue (Zendaya repeatedly destroy herself and her relationships due to her opiate addiction, the glamorization argument is weak. Zendaya alsorespondedto D.A.R.E.’s criticisms by emphasizing that the show is not meant to be a “moral tale,” but rather to humanize issues like drug addiction. While “Euphoria” might present a surreal, exaggerated version of the modern teenage experience, it also offers a heavy dose of realism, particularly in its writing and acting. Eye-candy aside, the show is resonant because of its earnestness and accuracy in capturing the underlying sentiment of what it’s like to come of age in current times. Perhaps one of the reasons for the show’s popularity is that it doesn’t coddle or presume that its viewers will be unable to digest difficult subject matter. It is also absent of an ideological agenda — it doesn’t moralize or virtue-signal, but it also doesn’t glorify. We as viewers need the sensational stuff not only for the sake of art but to shift the conversation onto these difficult subjects. It sets a terrible cultural precedent if we start blaming and holding art and entertainment accountable for society’s troubles. The allure of “Euphoria,” and its inherent power, is in the fact that it isn’t righteous or preachy. The fact that it doesn’t have D.A.R.E.’s seal of approval tells us that it’s doing something right. Melissa Newell is an Opinion Intern for the winter 2022 quarter.

stanforddaily_2022_124,"Ah, club rollouts – what a quintessential quirky Stanford experience! Awakening in alarm to the sound of your door being knocked down, praying that it’s not for your roommate, banging on other Chosen Ones’ doors and wandering around campus in your pajamas. But what about that roommate who isn’t rolled out? What about those who experience their first painful rejections so early on in their Stanford lives? Why do so many pre-professional and industry/business-oriented clubs contribute to a culture that makes frosh feel inadequate and underqualified without so much as a rejection email? It is clear that there is often a false conflation of exclusivity with excellence, with many freshmen bugging upperclassmen and asking online about which clubs are the most difficult to get into. Some clubs lean into this by boasting their low acceptance rates to new recruits. If this all sounds familiar, it’s because this exact mentality drives the race for the “most prestigious” college admissions. It fosters an environment in which you feel artificially good about being one of the privileged selected few and therefore may want to keep your group exclusive as you rise in the ranks; see backlash to the university’s expansion plans after a record endowment. From the activities fair to endless emails, clubs seem desperate for you to apply and join their community, only to ghost you after unsuccessful first round interviews. One almost suspects that some clubs put excessive effort into encouraging applications simply so that they can reject more people and inflate their exclusivity and, thus, prestige. The main defense of exclusivity is that the resources of these clubs are often limited, and so in order to give some students the best possible footing, they must take fewer new members. However, the most frustrating outcome of this culture is seeing only half of the club’s chosen interns or fellows or analysts or consultants turn up to all their programmed events to take advantage of the very resources they have been selected to access. This is understandable – students are busy with all manner of academic, social and other extracurricular activities that will naturally prevent many from fully committing to one club. But then that club’s limited resources should be allocated to those who are likely to make the most of them rather than half the people chosen to that stage. So what if clubs opened up, and what would that even look like? The belief that opening pre-professional clubs to all students would drain resources often doesn’t hold given that many activities, especially in frosh fall, are not resource-restricted: talks from club board members, industry leaders, and professors; lecture-style resume workshops; study nights and community-forming. Clearly anybody and everybody could benefit from insightful talks, mailing lists and potential mentors, and yet these are currently only accessible to members of certain clubs. And on what basis? The selection process, which almost always involves resume-processing and interview rounds, bakes in biases and particularly disadvantages FLI students and others who have not had previous experience or access to industry opportunities. At the moment, club applications typically involve two main types of questions: explain why you like and want to join the club, and tell us about a time you were a leader/entrepreneur. The first genre of questions is essentially meaningless when applicants are frosh who barely know the club beyond its name and mission statement. The latter, especially when paired with resumes of high-school accomplishments, preferences those whose high schools had several clubs and societies to lead, grants and teacher support to buoy student entrepreneurship and students who had the time to pursue extracurricular activities outside classes, work and familial responsibilities. Absolutely nobody’s access to opportunities in college should be influenced or determined by the experiences they had in high school, particularly when those opportunities can help build careers. However much leadership experience you had in high school is not an indicator of how good of a leader you are nor, much more importantly, how great of a leader you can become. Furthermore, many club boards are currently dominated by white and East Asian students, and this type of demographically unrepresentative board can dissuade underrepresented frosh from applying and potentially being fairly evaluated. Where resources are genuinely restricted (mainly when club programs work directly with industry , there are two potentially better ways to select “interns”: later application cycles and participation-based access. Many applications for selective freshman programs occur within the first five weeks of students even stepping foot onto campus; they likely have no exposure to the club before applying. With late Fall or Winter application cycles instead, frosh will gain a much clearer sense of whether this is actually a community they want to join rather than simply following the crowd, and club leaders can see how committed and how good of a fit potential members would be. This means that only students who are genuinely interested in the club will apply, and the club will likely choose more suitable members, reducing unnecessary rejection and incompatible new recruits. For the reasons mentioned earlier, there are very, very few (if any instances in which your resume or ability to write well about your high school projects and passion for a club you have never meaningfully participated in should determine whether you are accepted to an organization at Stanford. The solution is to simply allocate positions and resources (again, only where they are truly limited based on who turns up most regularly and shows the most keen interest. Then we can minimize the resources wasted by uncommitted members and increase the actual functionality of those roles, for example helping to organize speakers. Of course, these are imperfect suggestions with their own flaws, but I think they would certainly improve the cut-throat and uneven playing ground on which many pre-professional clubs currently operate. At the end of the day, everyone should have equal opportunity to access a new industry and learn the skills they want to learn; why exclude people with the excuse of mimicking the finance/consulting/tech job search, when the club should help you become qualified for those very jobs? Being part of a university like Stanford should open up a world of opportunities, not introduce a new set of hurdles to access the most basic ones.

crimson_2022_69,"Harvard will continue to perpetuate its legacy of racism and white supremacy as long as it retains remnants of slavery and white supremacy. One timely example is Harvard’s fight to retain ownership of the early images of enslaved Black people commissioned by racist Harvard natural scientist Louis Agassiz. The images, rediscovered in the 1970s, were daguerreotypes, early types of photographs, commissioned in 1850 by Louis Agassiz. His request for detailed images of Black bodies for study used enslaved men and women, without their permission, to facilitate his claims that he could prove the inferiority of the Black race through scientific study. Harvard’s ownership of these images continues the legacy of white institutional ownership of Black bodies. To emancipate itself from this legacy of white supremacy, Harvard must renounce ownership of the images and give them to an African-American history museum. Agassiz was born in Switzerland and educated in Europe before moving to the United States to work as a natural scientist and zoologist. He received a teaching position at Harvard in the 1840s where he spent much of his time creating the University’s Museum of Comparative Zoology. Agassiz’s 19th-century daguerreotypes are some of the earliest images of enslaved men and women. According toHarvard’s Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Agassiz commissioned the images to study Black bodies and “used polygenism to argue that Black people were part of an inferior race.” The photos included seven subjects: Alfred, Delia, Drana, Fassena, Jack, Jem, and Renty, all from South Carolina plantations, with stoic expressions . Each image exhibits their Blackness like specimens, placed squarely in the photo’s frame for maximum observation. Some photos show only the top half of the subjects, while others show them fully nude, standing facing forward and sideways. The photos show strong but worn-down Black people — people who have been beaten, forced to work, and humiliated. The most striking element of the photos are their eyes, which tell a story of sadness and dehumanization under slavery. However, the unethical display of these images — which were photographed for the purpose of elevating racist ideologies — only bolster the credibility of the pseudo-scientist that commissioned them. The issue of ownership of the imagesgained attentionafter Tamara Laniersued Harvardfor the daguerreotypes, claiming to be a direct descendant of Renty. In March 2021, a Massachusetts judgedismissedLanier’s lawsuit, arguing that the images of this type belong to the photographer and not the subject. More than 150 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, spoils of their labor and images of the enslaved still belong to the enslaver’s enabler. The debate on the ownership of Black and Indigenous art comes as museums worldwide reckon with themovement to return stolen artto their rightful owners. Many African nations are fighting for andregaining controlof their stolen artifacts, and African leaders like Chimamanda Adichie are underscoring this effort in their advocacy. Sheexplainedto German leaders at the country’s new Humboldt Forum museum that a “nation that believes in the rule of law cannot possibly be debating whether to return stolen goods. It just returns them.” So should Harvard. The Agassiz daguerreotypes aren’t artifacts stolen from great African nations through the treachery, looting, and wealth extraction of colonialism. But they are stolen images of Black bodies taken without permission and used to perpetuate the lies of white supremacy. For its part, Harvardreleased a statementabout the Agassiz images calling them “powerful visual indictments of the horrific institution of slavery” and expressed the wish to make the images “more accessible to a broader segment of the public and to tell the stories of the enslaved people that they depict.” Harvard being allowed to control the usage and ownership of these images is akin to a predator retaining the ownership of revenge porn. This must change. Harvard’s relationship with Agassiz cannot be decoupled from his adherence and mission to use the images to reinforce white supremacy. Regardless of what any court rules, Harvard must do what’s right and find a museum dedicated to African-American history and give it the daguerreotypes. The University should relinquish their interest in the images and have Black scholars at Harvard — the Black Alumni Society, Black students, and community leaders — lead the search to find these images a new home. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., or the Museum of African American History in Boston are possibilities for a new home. There are many African American history museums around the country that could benefit from owning and sharing these images and their story with the world. Six of the seven subjects of the images lived long enough to seeemancipationin 1865. But as long as their images remain in the University’s possession, they can never be fully free. Black bodies, even in photography, deserve a home free of inequality and white supremacy. Harvard is not that home. Thomas R. Bishop is a Mid-Career Master in Public Administration student at the Harvard Kennedy School. This piece is a part of a focus on Black authors and experiences for Black History Month."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_31,"In the wake of the 2019pro-democracy protests, Hong Kong’s independent media began to disappear. The sources that millions relied on for opposition statements were forced to stop reporting as their leaders werearrestedand accused of seditious acts. This represented a clear effort to dismantle the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. The news companies that are currently functioning are forced toself-censorthemselves in order to avoid arrest. Theremovalof many of these pro-democracy outlets is a blatant effort to undermine free press and democracy. It started with Apple Daily, an independent newspaper founded in 1995 byJimmy Lai. Mr. Lai, a forcefully anti-communist and anti-government individual, worked to produce media that held government officials accountable while also keeping up on all the latest celebrity scandals. Apple Daily was wildly different than most newspapers, presenting itself in tabloid form with large images and bold fonts plastered across entire pages. The direct and flashy nature of Apple Daily was able to grab readers’ attention quickly, which is arguably why it was the first major member of the Hong Kong press to be taken down. Photo courtesy ofJust Clicks With a Camera. During the pro-democracy protests, Apple Daily strongly voiced its support for the movement. Mr. Lai even took part in protests himself. This ultimately proved dangerous when Chinese officials later implemented asweeping national security law,turning Apple Daily into a target. This law from Beijing made it clear that Hong Kong would no longer be hospitable to a free press. The voices of millions had been silenced by citing national security. Journalists pledged to fight hard to keep Hong Kong informed, doing everything they could to produce important stories, but the overreach would ultimately become too much. A little over a month after the national security law was imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing, Lai was arrested and the office of the Apple Daily was raided for the first time. Signaling the beginning of the end of a free press in Hong Kong. Officers barged into the newsroom on Aug.10, rummaging through desks and seizing materials and computers. While the raid was occurring Apple Daily journalists attempted to livestream from inside the newsroom but were quickly stopped by officers. The journalists then moved to the roof of the office building where they could stream it from a distance, determined to document the events. The police said they had a warrant to search and seize material from the office as a result of an investigation that showed Apple Daily had published over 30 articles encouraging foreign countries toenact sanctionson Hong Kong and China. There was also a separate warrant directed at Lai for his involvement in encouraging sanctions, therefore breaking the national security law. However, the national security law was so broad that it recognized any attempt to criticize the government as a threat to national security. Meaning that Apple Daily’s coverage of the pro-democracy protests was enough to constitute criminal activity. The new regulations make Hong Kong look more like mainland China each day, lacking a free press and government transparency. As soon as the officers left, the newsroom was considered a crime scene. But that didn’t stop Apple Daily reporters from releasing articles and videos. Journalists who had their computers seized wrote articles on their smartphones. The newspaper“vowed to carry on and publish as usual”a headline said. The same day they published over a dozen articles and images on their website depicting Lai’s arrest and the police operation. Apply Daily staff worked diligently for months to keep the newspaper running while many top officials were facing legal battles and jail time. Almost a year after the first raid, on the morning of June 17, Apple Daily was raided once again. This time officers arrested editor-in-chief Ryan Law and four other top directors. Yet again, Apple Daily staff returned to a newsroom in disarray, but ready and eager to continue reporting. The next day’s paper soldhalf a million copies, over five times the normal amount, as Hong Kong’s residents wanted to show their support of Apple Daily. However, later that day many of Apple Daily’s accounts totaling over $500 million, were frozen by the government. The grip that Beijing had on the paper was strong and the end of Apple Daily was near. The frozen accounts gave Next Digital Media, Apply Daily’s parent company, no choice but to close the publication for good, citing the inability to pay staff. The last newspaper, published on June 23rd with the message“farewell and take care”sold out within hours, selling over one million copies. Apple Daily’s dissolution was a painstaking process that only showed the extent that Beijing officials would go to in order to regain complete control of the island. They were willing to burn the building down to preserve their image. Apple Daily was only the beginning. In the following months,similar situationswould unfold at many of Hong Kong’s independent media companies. Newsrooms were raided, journalists arrested, and suddenly publication stopped altogether. Online news websites were taken offline, corresponding social media accounts were deleted overnight, and thousands of journalists were left without jobs. The widespread fall of the free press in Hong Kong became painfully clear. While the free media in Hong Kong continues to collapse, executives from Hong Kong and Beijing continue to defend the measures. Hong Kong’s chief secretary, John Lee, claimed the independent media platforms“unlawfully exploited the media as a tool to pursue their political or personal gains,”in a recent letter to the Wall Street Journal. Executives from Hong Kong and Beijing can continue to deny their goal to take away freedoms, but that doesn’t make it any less true. The collapse of the free press was done in an attempt to increase government oversight while reducing the rights of citizens. Even more worrisome, individuals and corporations at all levels now will be unable to voice their concerns and opinions of the government freely. Hong Kong used to have the most free and vibrantmediain all of Asia, now residents are forced to consume state-sponsored media. The large media corporations that remain, such as South China Morning Post owned by a mainland China tech giant, almost always take apro-government approach.Refusing to participate in any investigative journalism that may cause them to uncover something they won’t like. Hong Kong’s continuing trend away from democratic principles can be seen in other aspects of life. Hong Kong’s largest independent trade union, The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, was forced to disband due to ongoing“political uncertainty.”Even major international newspapers such as the New York Times and The Washington Post have decided toleave Hong Kongfor Seoul, where they will be able to continue reporting without the worry of China’s overreach. More and more individuals and companies are starting to see Hong Kong as inhabitable, forcing relocation. Until the international community can pressure China to recognize Hong Kong’s autonomy that waspromised, Hong Kong will continue to become more difficult to differentiate from mainland China. While some differentiation still exists, it could be soon that Hong Kong is just a continuation of the mainland, lacking autonomy, transparency, and liberties.

wildcat_arizona_2022_57,"UA student checking into the Think Tank at Bear Down Gymnasium on Friday, October 5, 2018 in Tucson, Ariz. The Think Tank is open to all students that need tutoring or advising. Students may also receive one-on-one tutoring for writing help. I’ve always found writing to be one of the most important skills a person can have in their life. Not everyone will become a best-selling novelist or a master prose writer, but I firmly believe that everyone has the ability to write just as well. It’s also important to note that writing is one of those skills that you’ll use in some capacity every day. This is especially true for college students. No matter how much some students may dread it, college students can never escape the need to be able to compose a comprehensible piece of writing. The importance of being able to write is crucial and students, especially incoming freshmen right out of high school, will come to find that college writing does not compare to high school writing. The main difference between high school writing and college writing is the fact that college writing expects students to write in a manner that demonstrates both their knowledge on the subject (of what they’re writing about and their critical thinking skills according to an article written by theUniversity of Maryland Global Campus. The formulaic style of writing we were taught in high school (introduction paragraph, thesis statement, three body paragraphs and conclusion paragraph won’t be enough anymore to glide through classes. Some students may be able to adapt to the change, and some students may even excel at this new level of writing, but for the rest, writing may become the bane of their existence. Professors may offer office hours to help the students who may be struggling but sometimes the time just doesn’t align with a student’s schedule or the professor’s help is not enough. Who else can a student turn to for help? For University of Arizona students, there is a resource readily accessible to us that can solve our writing woes. That resource is the Writing Center. The Think Tank Writing Center is one of the many tutoring programs offered through the Think Tank program at the University of Arizona. Think Tank offers tutoring services for students that cover a range of topics such as math, writing, business, science and foreign languages, as well as offers exam prep according to theThink Tank’s List of All Services page. According to their2020-2021 Annual Report, 5,736 students have used their services with 2,004 of those students utilizing the Writing Center. The writing tutoring services offered at the Writing Center are divided up into five different formats that fit a student’s needs. According to theWriting Center website, they are divided up as follows: in-person appointment, Zoom appointment, Feedback Loop, Graduate Writing Lab and fee-based appointments. All appointments excluding the fee-based appointments are free for UA students to use. If students seek to make an appointment, it can be done through theWriting Center website, where they’ll be prompted to sign in to their scheduling system called “Retain” with their NetID and password in order to book an appointment. RELATED:The Student Success District: Campus’s newest addition An in-person appointment, as the name suggests, is an in-person tutoring session located at the Bear Down Gymnasium. Appointment sessions last 45 minutes and students are paired up with a certified peer tutor. A Zoom appointment is an online appointment done through the web conferencing software Zoom. These sessions last 30 minutes and students are also paired up with a certified peer tutor. These sessions have screen-sharing capabilities allowing for students to share their screen of the work they wish to receive help on. The Feedback Loop is a unique service offered at the Writing Center where students can upload a document they wish to receive feedback on to their Retain system where a certified peer tutor will spend 45 minutes providing suggestions and feedback before returning it. The return time for feedback varies so it’s vital for students to be aware of the time restraints they give themselves with the requested document. The Graduate Writing Lab is another tutoring service offered solely to graduate students to help with their graduate work. Services are done through the following formats: in-person, Zoom or a Feedback Loop with an in-person appointment being located at the Graduate Center. A fee-based appointment is an appointment where students can pay $50 an hour to receive tutoring from a staff member. The certification process a peer tutor undergoes is thorough. According to UA English senior Erika Brittain, who works as a peer tutor at the Writing Center, tutors attend weekly training sessions that go over topics relevant to tutoring writing. Peer tutors do not have to take a certification test to be certified, but instead, certification is reliant on their training attendance which is overseen by the Writing Center admin team. According to Brittain, “a semester’s worth of training is equal to one level of certification.” In other words, the certifying of tutors is done on the job. The peer tutors at the Writing Center are trained in particular to help students with all forms of writing. According to theWriting Center’s FAQ page, tutors can help with essays, creative works and even professional documents such as job applications and resumes. Students can even walk into a session with no document prepared. If you just need help with brainstorming or have a really rough draft, students can expect to leave a session having accomplished whatever tasks they sought. Tutors are trained beyond just recognizing grammatical errors, they also look to enhance a student’s style of writing. They offer a fresh pair of eyes to a piece of work and identify ways to strengthen a student’s own writing overall apart from just completing a single assignment. I have personally used the Writing Center many times for my own writings and have found the experience extremely positive. I usually make Zoom appointments since it works better with my schedule, and the time slots they offer are very flexible. I would recommend making appointments ahead of time since, in my experience, trying to make an appointment the same day is hard as slots tend to fill up quickly. I found the peer tutors to be very patient and very constructive in their feedback. Sometimes I would go into a session feeling super nervous and self-conscious about what I wrote, but the tutors had a way of making me feel comfortable and even confident in my work. The sessions are geared towards helping students recognize any areas they need improvement in, with the tutors there to give you suggestions on how to reach that level of improvement. I personally feel more comfortable seeking help from a fellow student since there is this mutual understanding of the struggles a student goes through, especially in regard to academics. The Writing Center also sponsors a variety of workshops that can give in-depth lessons on different aspects of writing such as resume and personal statement writing, revisions, the writing process itself and more as stated on theirWorkshops and Studios page. So, if you are suffering from writer’s block or are tired of having your roommate struggle through reading your rough drafts, make an appointment at the Writing Center. You’ll receive the best help that the UA can offer. Follow Tereza Rascon onTwitter Tereza Rascon (she/her is a senior majoring in English.

crimson_2022_86,"The Harvard Undergraduate Council was originally established, as many things are at Harvard, through a committee process approved by the administration and instituted through faculty legislation in 1982. While a referendum was held for students to vote on the UC’s creation, it was bankrolled by anadministration-funded publicity drive. In the 40 years since then, it has achieved progress in some areas. In recent years, however, the UC has been the source of more grief and embarrassment than school pride. Frustrations with the system have been widely felt throughout the student body, withonly 17 percentof Harvard seniors approving of their UC President and Vice-President in 2021. These frustrations are enhanced by the fact that the UC is funded by part of the $200 student activities fee undergraduates pay each year. The UC has also faced financial scrutiny; Risk Management and Audit Services have been called in to conduct a thorough investigation of the organization’s methods and monetary decisions after an overwhelmingly large amount of financial allegations during the previous UC election. Though there have been a few victories over the years, overall the UC has failed the student body. Its flawed, inherently confrontational structure — one previously created by administrators — has made it difficult for the UC to organize students and make long-lasting change. Generating sustainable solutions is not a core aspect of the current, and outdated, UC model. But students are not complacent – they want an improved system. That is one of the reasons they gave the UC a“vote of no confidence”and elected the current president and vice-president in last November’s UC presidential election. It was from this same desire for change that a group of students assembled to write a new constitution. This group of students were tasked with one key question: if we were to create an inclusive, open, and effective student government at Harvard today, what would it look like? Twice a week for several months, these students — first-years and upperclassmen, international and domestic students, athletes and non-athletes, and students from a diverse array cultural backgrounds — debated and discussed topics ranging from the high-level goals of a body to the nitty gritty details of club financing and elections. Talking with students, UC members, professors, and other organizations around Harvard’s campus, they created an innovative new system for student advocacy: the Harvard Undergraduate Association. The HUA constitution is modeled after highly successful student associations worldwide, specifically the University of Sheffield’s that has an approval rating ofover 90 percent. Rather than electing all of its members, membership of the HUA would be open to anyone who would like to join. This larger body of members would then be organized into teams — such as academics, residential life, or well-being — that focus on tackling key issues at Harvard. Annual school-wide elections would be used to determine the officers who would lead each of these teams, and two co-presidents who would ensure the student association continues to represent students’ needs. Electing officers for a particular team would lead to campaigns that are both policy-focused and practically more achievable. Tools such as referenda, sortition, and digital democracy would be used to ensure accountability and democratic legitimacy when the HUA would make policy decisions. The HUA would take direct action as a student advocacy group. Students who care about issues would be able to meet with administrators through the HUA’s connections, allowing for the new student association to give a platform to more students, rather than the current structure of speaking for those who can speak for themselves. The new structure would allow any student to partake in the student association’s work in an open, transparent, and student-centric model. The HUA is designed to promote student body participation — this would make strong and successful advocacy possible. Volunteer participation would also be a constant litmus test of the efficacy of the organization, aiming to bolster legitimacy and have a group that truly represents the student body’s voice. If this new constitution is ratified, the HUA will immediately launch specific measures that are in alignment with its values. Students will be partially refunded with the current withheld UC funds. Club applications and funding will be streamlined and more flexible, allowing for clubs to start during different times of the academic year and funding processes to be tailored to clubs’ needs. Also, by integrating specific teams into the structure of the HUA, a multitude of issues can get deserving attention, unlike the current model that pushes different issues to the back for the sake of parliamentary procedures. Harvard is one of the premier institutions of higher learning in the world. Why shouldn’t our student association represent the caliber of students we have? As a volunteer-driven student association, the HUA will differ from the UC with the student body’s direct participation, becoming the first student association at Harvard created entirely by students for students. We support the new constitution and a dissolution of the fragmented and outdated UC. Shruti Gautam ’25 lives in Hurlbut Hall. Ben A. Ray ’24 is an Applied Mathematics concentrator in Mather House.

state_press_2022_19,"OnFeb. 24,2022, RussianPresident Vladimir Putinbegan a special military operation intending to launch a full-scale invasion into Ukraine. The situation in Ukraine is going from bad to worse as the Ukrainian people are fighting hard to resist the Russian military and are putting their lives on the line to defend their freedom and their country. While the situation has been tense for Ukrainians in Eastern Europe, things have also been difficult for Ukrainian students, staff and faculty at ASU. ASU officials have reached out to Ukrainian students to offer to help them in any way possible, however, some students said the aid hasn’t been adequate and has failed to address some of the issues they face. “Firstly, I would like to state that I don’t agree with this being a mere crisis. It is a full-fledged war, said Valeriia Starosek, an international student from Ukraine and senior studying computer science. Starosek expressed her strong displeasure with the use of words like “crisis” and “conflict” instead of “war,” as she feels that these terms tend to dilute the truth and leads to a lack of understanding among others who are not directly affected by it. Starosek said her mental health has been suffering. She explained how back in Ukraine, her family has had to relocate, but couldn’t cross the border to Poland because her stepfather needs to stay back and volunteer, as Ukraine has banned male citizens between the age of 18 and 60 from leaving thecountry to defend Ukraine.She said she facessurvivor’sguilt as she feels in a position of privilege to be in a safe space here in the U.S. Mykhaylo Mykhaylov, a freshman from Ukraine studying computer science, said “waking up every day to devastating news from Ukraine, dealing with the stress that it brings throughout the day while tending to my academic commitments has been difficult. Mykhaylov has been unable to sleep on time, partly to be able to talk to his family, because Ukraine is nine hours ahead of Arizona, and partly because of stress from listening to the news. The war has affected these students’ day-to-day lives in the U.S. Students from Ukraine have been facing difficulties with their housing and piling debt, as their families back home have had a loss of livelihood and property as they relocate. Families have less money, not just for themselves but also to support their children studying abroad, and nobody knows what the economy will look like going forward. Not to mention, therecenttuition increases as proposed byASUPresident Michael Crow exacerbate existing financial concerns. ASU has taken some steps to aid the students. Mykhaylov and Starosek said they received some emails from the Dean of Students, from theInternational Students and Scholars Centerand some professors who have offered academic arrangements, temporary financial aid and access to counseling services at ASU. The students want to have more help in terms of tuition, rent and better wages for on-campus jobs to make ends meet, and ASU could be doing more to aid them in this regard. There should be support groups and community support made available to Ukrainian students so that they can make sense of the struggles they re facing, concentrate on their academics better or get any other help with mental health issues that they may seek. Starosek said she hopes ASU provides services like flexible assignment deadlines, access to recorded lectures and other such academic or scheduling adjustments across the board for all Ukrainian students to ease stress in these areas when their necessities like food and shelter are in jeopardy. She called for unity among Ukrainians and the international community to help each other in times of need. She said that in Ukrainian culture, it is always preferable to try and fix things themselves instead of asking for help, but she wants to emphasize the fact that these times are unprecedented and people should not hesitate to ask for help. Now more than ever, these students need help and support from the University, from the government, and the community, including the community of international students studying at ASU. Volunteer for organizations that are trying to support them. It is upon us to support them and show them that they are not alone. Reach out to theInternational Students and Scholars Centerat 480-727-4776 orissc@asu.edu, or the Dean of Students Office atdeanofstudents@asu.eduand ask for the help you need.

stanforddaily_2022_15,"“Vote NO on Prop 26, Vote YES on Prop 26:” Like many of you, I have been endlessly barraged by ads for this proposition over the past few months. My understanding was completely surface level — I knew it had something to do with gambling, but that was it. So when state ballots were sent out, I decided to take a deep dive into thetext of Proposition 26to figure out what it says, and — crucially — should I vote yes or no? Thebarebones of the propositionis that it will legalizein-personsports betting, roulette and dice gameson tribal landsin California. It will also legalize sports betting at four horse racing tracks; in return, 10% of the profits generated by these tracks will be placed into the California Sports Wagering Fund (CSWF . 40% of the CSWF will likely go to increased spending on K-12 schools and community colleges. The remaining 60% is to be used for sports betting and gambling-related costs. So the question arises — why is this on the ballot anyway? In 1992, the federal government passed the Bradley Act, which effectively prohibited sports betting in states (bar a few — Nevada incl. . However, in May 2018, the Supreme Courtstruckdown this provision inMurphy v. NCAA. This effectively allowed individual states to make their own laws regarding sports betting at state gambling centers, which are mainly racetracks and casinos. California’s gambling laws are unique both due to its constitution and the state’s constituents.California’s constitution prohibits Nevada and New Jersey-style casinos,slot machines, roulettes and banked/percentage types of card games where the house/casino has a stake. California also has a significant Indigenous population — according to the 2010 nationalcensus, 12% of all individuals who identify as Native American reside in California. This is relevant because, in 1988, the federal government passed the Indian Gaming RegulatoryAct, which stated that gambling can take place on tribal lands, subject to the classification of the type of gambling. For certain gambling classes such as slot machines and lottery games, a tribal-state compact is needed for legality. California, in 2000,passedProposition 1A, which allowed compacts to be signed with79tribes in California, establishing the current status quo with regards to California gambling. Horse racing is the otherformof legal gambling in California not tied to tribal lands. This is mainly due to historicalprecedent, havingexistedsince 1933 when voters in California voted to legalize pari-mutuel betting, the type of betting used in horse racing. Allowing gambling on tribal lands has had success ingeneratingrevenue for crucial tribal services such as healthcare, fire services, law enforcement services, schools, scholarships and others. Furthermore, the direct impact to the California GDP is significant: 124,300 jobs, $20 billion directly and $1 billion in taxes to the state of California in 2016. Horse racing, the other form of legal gambling in California, is also very lucrative; it has generated$18million in fee revenue for the state. Between 1992 to 2018, during the years of effect of the Bradley Act, unregulated and untaxed sports betting still took place nationwide, with the federal government in 1999 estimating that up to $80 billion of sports bets wereplacedyearly. These illegal bets — unlicensed, untaxed and unregulated — made itproneto criminal influences such as money laundering, drug financing and organized crime. Hence, the idea behind legalizing Prop 26 is to shift money out of the black market and allow for regulation and safe betting practices. The pure numbers indicate that legalizing sports betting at these tribal lands and horse tracks will not only help the tribes continue to operate comfortably, but also generate more revenue for the state and local governments. This time around, revenue earned through sports betting at horse tracks (CWSF will be earmarked for public education related measures.Spending more on education has been shown to not only raise graduation rates but also boosts adult income. Using gambling money to fund education is not a new idea. In fact, in Georgia, the state lottery entirely funds the HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships. Thesescholarships, established in 1993, are available to any Georgia resident graduating from high school with a certain GPA to use to pay up to 100% of tuition costs in in-state public colleges and has helped more than 1.8 million college students. However, will benefits from increased revenue go as far as the text of the proposition suggests? I don’t think so; theincreasedcosts of regulation are non-significant (low millions of dollars as estimated by the Legislative Analyst Office , and usage of 60% of the CWSF fund for regulation costs may be too optimistic, in that costs may be higher. There will be an influx of civil suits that the state courts will have to handle arising from disputes of gambling laws, and particularly new procedural overhead costs for review of accusations of breaking such laws. There is also an inherent vice, virtue trade-off.Gamblingcan be addictive and its addiction affects about 4% of all adult Americans and causes about $7 billion worth of social cost (bankruptcy, criminal justice and healthcare costs . The personal dangers of addiction — financial ruin and poor mental health (guilt, depression, anxiety, stress cannot be understated. Furthermore, there is an increased risk for adolescents who actively gamble, as it has beenshownthat those who engage in gambling report significant psychological, social and financial consequences, including but not limited to, undertaking high-risk behaviors (drinking, smoking , mental health issues (depression and antisocial behaviors and high risk of combined addiction (alcohol or other drugs . The main question I have is how effective the proposed protections are in keeping underage betters away (and a significant portion of the text of the proposed law is dedicated to prevention of underage betting, either through advertising or marketing . Underage gambling is a significant issue;California Problem Gambling Healthline 2020 Annual Reportshows that about 36% of all gamblers that called were underage. The fact that the law makes itin-personhelps in verification of ages, but the possibility of fake IDs cannot be ignored. I also wonder how expanded betting opportunities will affect the rates of underage gambling. Will the appearance of ads for sports betting influence more underage people to bet, or will it unduly influence their activities when they do become of-age? My hope would be that some portion of the CWSF and/or increased taxable revenue from tribal lands be used to combat some of these negative side-effects of gambling, such as further educational outreach to at-risk individuals, public awareness and funding for treatment centers. But that’s for another day. Also, there are some strange contradictions in the text of the proposed law itself; the law prohibits betting on California collegiate teams, yet allows betting at the NCAA March Madness tournament, which raises the question of which tournaments are considered “big enough” to warrant betting. The Big Game and USC-UCLA are also considered to be classic big rivalries — will there be sports betting allowed here? However, despite these drawbacks, I do believe that it is worth voting yes on Prop 26 — the positives (increased revenue for services in tribal lands, increased taxable revenue for the state, earmarked money for public education in my opinion largely outweigh the negatives (potential for more gambling addiction or underage betting, legal and social costs, ambiguity in the law . Secondarily, it will help reduce an avenue of funding for organized crime. Would I prefer to see stronger clarifications on protecting wagerers themselves? Yes. Would I prefer that a higher percentage be spent towards education rather than 4% of the total CWSF? Yes. But honestly, this proposition has the potential to monetarily help California residents both Indigenous and otherwise, and I believe in that.

But what happens when our beaches get wrecked? Well, we have to do something about it. Unwreck the BeachisThe Ubyssey’s new sustainability column, written by UBC students, for UBC students. Our columnists are passionate about all things environment, from the climate crisis and sustainable food security to cool initiatives and events on campus and intersectionality within climate justice — they’ve got you covered. It’s time toUnwreck the Beach! Matt is in his fifth year at UBC majoring in media studies. He explores how social forces shape the way individuals perceive ‘climate change’ and seeks out stories that share why folks care. He has written the gamut from climate finance to university climate policy, but strives to centre justice and student voices within these discussions. Above all, Matt believes in the power of community-driven action, the perspectives of those at the front lines of climate and environmental injustice and the promises of a brighter future rooted in collective care — for our planet and each other. Forrest is in his fifth year at UBC majoring in anthropology with a minor in political science. He is excited and honoured to cover climate and ecological issues for the UBC community. While there is never a shortage of important and moving stories to tell, the far-reaching and entangled implications of the climate crisis have caused Forrest to agree with Bill McKibben that “Climate change is the single biggest thing humans have done on this planet. The one thing that needs to be bigger is our movement to stop it.” Jasmine is in her third year at UBC majoring in gender, race sexuality and social justice and minoring in creative writing. She is passionate about intersectional climate justice and is adamant about understanding the climate crisis as interlinked and inextricable from other global and local crises. She understands how overwhelming and frightening the media coverage and academic findings about the climate catastrophe is and hopes to use her reporting as a way to make understanding and combating the climate crisis more accessible and less paralyzing for students. Regardless of whether or not someone actually manages to find ‘Planet B’, she’s quite fond of ‘Planet A’ and would rather spend her time protecting it than abandoning it.

stanforddaily_2022_81,"Tim MacKenzie has been an academic worker at Stanford for nearly a decade. He worked as a graduate student in the Chemistry Department to earn a PhD and now works in the Genetics Department as a postdoc. Any errors in the description of the budget are the author’s own, and he welcomes a response from administrators – especially a detailed breakdown of the buffer funds and how they were (or were not utilized during the height of the pandemic in 2020.Tim MacKenzie has been a member of the Stanford community since arriving to start his PhD in the chemistry department in Fall of 2013. He currently works as a postdoctoral researcher in the genetics department.This article is a part of a two-part series on Stanford’s budget. Part IV: The Buffers My previous article gave an overview of similarities and differences between theoperating budgetand endowment. Both are invested to generate revenue. The principal of the endowment is never touched; the money in the operating budget is contained in the expendable funds pool (EFP which is, well, expendable. Unlike the endowment, EFP interest goes into university coffers rather than back to its own source. Stanford guarantees the balances of all accounts in the EFP regardless of market conditions. If there is a year with terrible returns, Stanford is on the hook even if the value of the EFP is not sufficient to fund university obligations. How does Stanford guarantee all balances if there is a down year for investment returns when so much of the budget is put into the market? The question of how to cover obligations during market downturns came into sharp focus during the Great Recession when endowment returns were hugely negative. Stanford has an obligation to cover payouts from the endowment and expenses in the operating budget. Following the scare caused by the 2008 recession, Stanford turned to a concept from chemistry to provide resiliency beyond the stability provided by the endowment smoothing formula: buffers. You may remember the concept of a buffer from high school in the context of acid-base chemistry; one hardly needs a PhD in Chemistry to grasp the concept. A buffer in chemistry is a solution that is able to resist changes in pH even when challenged with addition of acid or base. Stanford created a financial buffer to be able to resist changes in university operations when challenged with market downturns. Every year, excess returns from investments of the EFP get invested into the Tier I Buffer until it is worth 35% of the total EFP. After that, excess returns are put into the Tier II Buffer. Anytime returns from the endowment or the value of the EFP aren’t enough to cover the operating budget, money is withdrawn from Tier I Buffer until it reaches 80% of its initial size. After that, Tier II Buffer is used up before returning to the Tier I Buffer. The buffers also replenish individual accounts if returns are negative. If a professor taps into their grant to purchase an expensive instrument while the university’s investment of the funds has taken a downturn, the buffers make sure there are sufficient resources in a feat of financial legerdemain. In years with good returns, hundreds of millions of dollars are put into the buffers so they can fill this role; note the difference between the top line revenue and expenditures in the budget for this year (~$284M . By the end of the academic year, Tier I Buffer is projected to stand at $2.0 billion and Tier II Buffer will be $1.7 billion. Page 9 of this year’s operating budget says “the buffers serve as a financial reserve in the event of an earthquake or other disaster.” In other words, Stanford has nearly $4 billion in a rainy-day fund. In the 2019-2020 budget, the lastpre-COVID budget, Tier I and Tier II Buffers stood at $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. The buffers actuallygrewby more than a billion dollars during the ongoing pandemic. Meanwhile, hundreds of workers werelaid offand subcontracted workers wentmonths without promised pay. Apparently, a global pandemic does not reach the threshold of “earthquake or other disaster” required to utilize financial reserves to resist changes in university operations when challenged with market uncertainty. Though to the university’s credit, I am unaware of efforts to hire professorson a “without salary basis”like UCLA recently attempted. Part V: Creating Lasting Change Hopefully this brief outline of the endowment and operating budget gives insight as to why withdrawing from the endowment is a non-starter. But that doesn’t mean there is no way forward. Rather than pointing towards the endowment as a source of funding, activists can suggest investment returns from the EFP or the buffers. Every year, interest from Tier II Buffer generates ~$50M for use at thediscretion of the President. What administrators mean when they say there aren’t funds to cover a request is that Stanford is choosing to prioritize other things (say, growing the size of the buffers over what is being asked for (say, salary high enough that youcan affordtofeed your family . So what can you do with this information? The most important thing is to get organized. The Budget Committee has already started work on next year’s operating budget – many major decisions will have already been made when the budget is sent out for approval by the Faculty Senate in the coming weeks and Board of Trustees in June. Now is the time to identify the needs of your fellow community members and present them to decision makers. If you don’t know who the decision makers are, the acknowledgements section in the executive summary of the budget is a good place to start. If you want to see the budget process in action, keep an eye onagendas for the Faculty Senatethis quarter – faculty approval is a necessary step in the budget adoption process. Meetings are open to members of the Stanford community. Strong organization and clear demands made of decision makers can make change happen. The Black Community at Stanford published clear demands to the President and Provost in thesummer of 2020, laying groundwork for asuccessful campaignby the Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA over the last year to departmentalizeAfrican and African American Studies. When hundreds ofpostdocs and campus alliessigned a letterdecrying the cost increasesfor dependent healthcare, the increases were phased in over a year rather than happening suddenly.Graduate studentshaveprotested for yearsto save dependenthealth insurance plansfrombeing canceledbythe university. Before the pandemic, administrators would hold town halls where organized students couldpressure decision makers. When the practice of holding town halls was suspended by the pandemic,students organizedan eventof their ownto sharetheir planfor ajust and equitablereopening of the university. All of these approaches share a common thread: a committed core of organizers crystallizing the views of members of their community and building a coalition with campus allies, presenting a united front to administrators over a sustained period. The tactics from the graduate students were successful: while postdocs and service workers on campus saw dependent health insurance costs increase, plan ratesremained flatlast year for graduate students. But success is not guaranteed. Stanfordresisted callsfrom organized students to expandmental health resourceseven in theface of a lawsuitover their existingpolicies and conditions. It was not until welost community membersto suicide thatStanford heededcalls toexpand CAPS. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon forelite academic institutionsto waitfor the lossofcommunity membersto institute change. Building a broad coalition around widely and deeply felt issues is not a guarantee of success, but making change without doing so becomes exponentially more difficult. Another piece of advice is to push for the creation of an endowed fund to cover the costs of your request in perpetuity. The examples of victories listed above often involved the use of one-time funds from the university. Any improvement of material conditions is an achievement worth celebrating, but the use of one-time funds guarantees the need to continue to rehash the same battles in the future. With the anticipated 5% payout, a one-time investment of 20x the yearly costs for your request will ensure there will be funding for it as long as Stanford exists. Interest from the operating budget could serve as a source of funds. The development office could commit to fundraising for a specified purpose. Alumni canwithhold donationsunless they are put towards a specified endowed fund. Instead of asking to take money from the endowment, it is better to ask togrowthe endowment by creating a fund that will cover your request for the foreseeable future. Stanford recentlycanceled the CalTrain GoPassfor graduate students because the program was supported by one-time funds each year rather than being guaranteed through an endowed fund. But all the money in the world won’t guarantee you a seat at the table with decision makers, who may choose to vaccinate themselves beforephysicians treating COVID patientson the front lines. However, a strongly organized community that can rapidly mobilize in response to its needs can cause the university to backpedal andlisten to demands. Existing power structures exclude many of us from decisions Stanford makes as an institution even though they will materially impact our lives. The failures of the university during the pandemic crystallized that realization for medical residents, who havesince unionized. The new resident union can look toCRONA, the union that has been representing nurses at Stanfordsince 1966. CRONA provides an example of how activists can use union pressure and strikes to achieve their goals: for the first time in over two decades, more than 90% of organized nurses voted toauthorize a strikeafter Stanford failed to respond to demands, including better mental health coverage. Nurses and residents share working conditions and could strengthen their power by supporting each other. Ideally a labor stoppage can be avoided, but the rest of the Stanford community can show solidarity with the workers by reaching out to leadership in the administration and calling on them to provide for the frontline healthcare workers who have borne the brunt of the pandemic.

crimson_2022_45,"As scaffolding comes down at parts of Adams House and students enjoy newly renovated Lowell and Winthrop Houses, River West residents await news on when reconstruction will reach their gates. Eliot and Kirkland Houses, after almost a century of housing College students following their first opening in 1931, are two of the last Houses in need of renewal. As an Eliotite, I worry about when my House will begin tearing down its walls and closing its historic dorms to students. But more than anything, I worry that Harvard will fail to prepare Eliot for the wrath of climate change to come. Living on the Charles River is a cherished part of River West residency — we’re surrounded by history and close to views of rowers, kayakers, or perhaps even the occasional misguided swimmer. Yet we’re living in the calm before the storm. If climate change continues on its current course, Boston sea levels, compared to 2000 levels, are expected to rise by as much as a foot and a half by 2050, and as much as three feet by 2070. Eliot and Kirkland are situated right in the flood zones of the Charles — meaning that sometime in the next few decades, both River Houses are projected to be flooded, and perhaps even underwater. For years, Eliot and Kirkland have beensurveyedfor reconstruction plans in preparation for rebuilding and renovation efforts. Before any construction plans are finalized, I urge the administration, building managers, and architects to prioritize floodwater response and rising river levels in their assessments. If Harvard fails to recognize this threat, it will pay the price later, both in the University budget and the well-being of future students. Naively believing that climate change will remain a far-away issue and that the river will be forever harmless will have long-term consequences. Harvard must be a model for strong climate preparedness across all academic institutions. Sea levels are rising at an increasing rate as they approach our River West shores. As temperatures increase, ocean water warms and increases in volume in a process called thermal expansion. In Greenland, warmer summers cause the ice sheet to experience increased surface melting and ice mass loss, one of the greatest contributors to global sea level rise today. In Antarctica, West Antarctic glaciers are expected to flow into the ocean as ice shelves collapse from warming ocean water underneath, with the potential to significantly raise global sea levels on unpredictable timescales. Locally, sea level rise is also exacerbated by land sinking along coastlines, including the East Coast of the United States. This multitude of contributors to the sea level and the accelerated rate at which each is adding to the rise means responding swiftly is vital. Concerningly, downplaying the severity of future climate threats is the norm for not only academic institutions, but organizations and governments everywhere. The United States is responsible for an alarming24.6 percentof cumulative global emissions that have warmed the planet thus far. Yet it often feels as though our leaders still largely opt to maintain a blissfully ignorant view of the future when it comes to climate change response. Addressing climate change involves both reducing future emissions and preparing robust adaptation measures quickly — ignoring either has devastating consequences. At Harvard, adapting on campus means we cannot wait for water to pour into our dormitories before confronting rising sea levels. Now is the time to prepare, and Harvard should be leading the way. Adapting to rising sea levels requires a multifaceted approach. One of the largest hurdles for our coastal community is being able to rapidly prepare our infrastructure, buildings, and residential communities. Researchers expect that extreme winter storms, bringing high tides and storm surges to Boston Harbor, will continue to be the greatest flooding risk to the city in the years to come. Experts have proposed the construction of a harbor barrier, but the implementation of this would require over $11.8 billion. In a September hearing for sea-level rise planning, Boston officials reached no coordinated consensus on how to begin addressing the issue, agreeing only that significant funds would be required. While Harvard should encourage city leaders to implement barrier solutions in Boston Harbor, for now, Harvard must plan to protect riverside dorms like Eliot and Kirkland by prioritizing specific flood-safe design measures. This could include raising buildings higher above projected river levels, integrating flood greenspace like that used in theScience and Engineering Complex, ensuring electrical rooms and generators are located far above ground, making sure evacuation exits are in place if needed, and bringing in flood design experts. Preparing for adaptation efforts, both on Harvard’s campus and in collaboration with local city governments, is essential as the Charles rises. Redesigning Eliot and Kirkland with sea level in mind during future renewal projects is a first step. The Harvard bubble will not be impermeable to floods forever, no matter how protected we may feel living within its gates. Eleanor P.

rice_thresher_2022_41,"ByThresher Editorial Board3/29/22 10:52pm As it stands under the Student Association election rules, candidates are not allowed to send mass campaign emails, and included in this rule is anyone campaigning on behalf of the candidate. During this year’s SA presidential race, Rice PRIDE endorsed candidate Gabby Franklin, a choice they then shared with their members via an opt-in Listserv. This is now the subject of therecent complaintby former Will Rice College senator William Tsai who claims that the endorsement email was a violation of SA election rules. The case will be brought to University Court this upcoming Thursday, March 31. What this issue really highlights is the immediate need for the SA to update and clarify their rules around election time. The idea that under current policies, someone completely unrelated to a candidate could get them disqualified by a simple email through a Listserv is ridiculous. That was obviously not the intention of Rice PRIDE in their endorsement of Gabby, but the way the rules are currently written, it is a possibility for a group or individual with ill intentions, and that is to put simply, a huge problem. The rules also clearly allow for social media campaigns, which makes the lack of updates to policies even more inexcusable. As times change, so should the rules, and the SA needs to decide if they should treat social media and email campaigning differently. And no matter how they choose to view the platforms, the rules for each need to be spelled out and thought through more extensively. We want to be transparent as we write this — our editorial board endorsed Gabby as well, and now in the question of this case, we believe that her attributes and promise as an SA president outweigh these murky circumstances. As such, we believe that it should not prevent the changeover to her leadership. However, even disregarding our support of her candidacy and hopefully future presidency, we still find the process and regulation on its own here in need of immediate attention. And we also want to be clear that we don’t blame the current director of election or any specific student leaders. In fact, we recognize that the current rules are making their jobs more difficult — which is why they must change. The SA needs to come together to support a rule change process which is overdue in the institution. Otherwise we risk facing issues of discrepancies between the letter of the law and its spirit, and the students who suffer undue consequences as a result.

thetech_mit_2022_60,"​​To the editor, In an op-ed that appeared inThe TechMarch 3 (“We are international students and we are voting yes on the GSU” , some MIT Graduate Student Union (GSU students raised concerns that MIT is not doing enough to support international students and asserted that a union can do more. When weighing these claims and considering how to vote in the April 4–5 election, international students should be aware of the following important facts, prepared by MIT’s senior administrators. If the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE is successful, they will need to negotiate a contract, called a collective bargaining agreement. Such agreements have limits to what they can cover. For example, it is illegal to bargain for contract terms that violatefederal immigration law. A collective bargaining agreement cannot make any changes to federal immigration law. MIT and its international students must follow federal immigration laws whether or not a union is elected. Federal immigration rules state that expanded internships and experiential learning opportunities that meet the requirements for F-1 Curricular Practical Training (CPT authorization must be done via changes to the curricula. Making changes to curricula is an academic decision that requires extensive input from various members of our community, including faculty, students, departmental administrators, and others. Academic decisions are not mandatory subjects of labor bargaining, and are usually retained by the university (as they are at Harvard and Columbia, for example .Notably, the graduate student union contracts at Harvard and Columbia do not contain provisions regarding expanded CPT opportunities.As an outcome of theTask Force 2021, a joint faculty, student, and staff effort, MIT is already working on creating an Institute-wide professional development academic requirement for all graduate students. This would expand access to valuable internship, personal, and interpersonal skills development, and experiential learning opportunities for all students. In doing so, it would also provide expanded CPT opportunities for all F-1 international students, addressing this issue across the board. MIT has a proven track record of fighting for international students, without any union involvement. During a time when the nation’s leadership was particularly hostile to international students, President Reif wrote the following in aNew York Timesopinion piece: “As a nation, when we turn our backs on talented foreign students, we not only lose all that they bring to our classrooms and laboratories, we also give up a strategic asset.” In 2020, together with Harvard, MIT successfullyfiled suitagainst the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (USDHS and its Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to prevent enforcement of a policy that would have barred international students on F-1 visas from taking a full online course load while studying in the U.S. Every year,MIT’s International Students Office (ISO assists more than 4,000 students and their families with their visas. Getting things wrong can have serious implications. That’s why MIT has a dedicated, growing group of professionals who provide important guidance to students. Neither the MIT GSU nor the UE has this level of expertise and resources. MIT’s ISO supports international students who need help to cover legal fee costs for student consultations with immigration attorneys, pays USDHS application fees, and helps with emergency flights home and short-term family housing needs. International students are also eligible to seek and receive emergency funds from a number of otherMIT student support offices. If the UE becomes the sole representative of graduate students in the bargaining unit, we do not know how these matters will be handled in contract negotiations and what an article on international students might look like. MIT approvedvirtually everyrequest (either as is, or with some modifications for remote international appointments during the pandemic. During the pandemic, MIT dedicated $5.8 million and significant administrative resources to enable 1,300 requests for remote international appointments. This ensured that students did not face any interruptions to their academic and research progress and were able to continue their studies and research from abroad. MIT’s remote international appointments process is equally (if not more accommodating than the processes that were agreed to after several years of negotiations in the Harvard and Columbia graduate student union contracts. Under those contracts, remote international work is limited to situations where students are “unable” to return to the U.S. due to immigration issues or other reasons outside of students’ control. When that occurs, Harvard and Columbia have agreed to make “reasonable efforts” to enable remote work. MIT went above and beyond these measures to enable remote work during the pandemic for a wider range of reasons, even when students did not face absolute barriers to returning, in order to prevent negative impacts on students’ studies, research, and personal lives. Sincerely, David C. ElwellAssociate Dean and Director of the International Students Office"
state_press_2022_35,"Antisemitism still exists here at ASU, and it s our responsibility as a community of students to fight discrimination of any kind and make students across all cultures feel welcome. OnJan. 15, a 44-year-old British man held four people hostage at a Texas synagogue, including the rabbi.Later in the week, an FBI director called the attack an act of antisemitism. Antisemitism isn t just something we see on national news — it happens in our own community here at ASU. In August 2020,antisemitic posterswere found on ASU s Tempe campus. In November 2021,several more flyerswere found posted. Antisemitism exists here at ASU, and it s our responsibility as a community of students to fight discrimination of any kind in order to make students across all cultures feel welcome. Madeleine Steppel, a Jewish student and a junior majoring in religious studies, was subjected to antisemitism when she discovered one of the flyers at Hassayampa Academic Village in November. Steppel said that throughout the day her body was shaking due to theintergenerational traumaof antisemitism. READ MORE:ASU PD to investigate antisemitic flyers posted on Tempe campus You see these things happen on campus, but you never expect it to happen to you, Steppel said. According to the Anti-Defamation League, a national organization fighting antisemitism,one-thirdof Jewish students experienced antisemitism on college campuses in 2021. Only 51% of students who were victims of antisemitism on college campuses said they felt safe on campus. While antisemitism is an ongoing problem, it doesn t mean there can t be a solution. Many students highlighted the importance of educating non-Jews on Jewish culture to help combat antisemitism. Steppel said it s important for younger people to be educated too. Just like when kids are learning that racism is bad, at like 4 to 5 years old, we also need to be teaching them that antisemitism is bad, Steppel said. Only22 public school systemsmandate Holocaust education. While Arizona is one of the 22 states, Holocaust education wasn t mandated across the state untilJuly 2021. While many ASU students may have never received Holocaust education or been educated at all about Jewish culture, ASU Hillel executive director Debbie Yunker Kail said it doesn t mean they can t learn any of it now. When you see a Jewish student (or if you have a Jewish friend, ask them about their culture and tradition, and heritage, Yunker Kail said. Just the same way you would show interest in any person. According to Yunker Kail, some Jewish students themselves don t know a lot about their own culture. They may know they re Jewish, they may see something like what happened in Texas and feel personally affected, Yunker Kail said. But they may not even know how to explain it or how to articulate what their Jewish identity means to them. Yunker Kail said the best way to raise awareness is to give people the language to speak about their identity and culture so that they can deal with it themselves. But ending antisemitism shouldn t be the responsibility of Jewish people. Non-Jews need to step up and help as well. Call it out, Steppel said. Say what it is and explain why it s antisemitic as well. According to Rabbi Shmuel Tiechtel, of Chabad ASU, acts of violence don t just happen. Acts of violence don t start from acts of violence, Tiechtel said. Usually they start from words of hate. When words of hate are stopped — but others are saying there’s no place for this — I believe that will stop acts of violence. We as a community here at ASU need to call out antisemitism when we see it or hear it — whether we re Jewish or not. If we can educate ourselves by learning more about different cultures and being kind to our Jewish friends on campus, ASU will be a more welcoming place for everyone.

crimson_2022_140,"As graduation for the Class of 2022 rapidly approaches, Commencement speakers, deans, professors, and parents alike are all preparing their grand speeches encouraging us to go forth and change the world. Last year, University President Lawrence S. Bacow conveyed his hope that the Class of 2021 would “hasten the world to better days.” Similar calls for new graduates to make an impact and improve our world will reverberate across Harvard Yard this month as students complete their coursework, collect their diplomas, and pack up their things for the next chapter in their lives. But as the heady excitement of graduation wanes and we all settle into our new careers, will we really be changing the world? Some of us may do work creating a positive impact; some of us may not. Some of us may love our next job; some may just need it to pay the bills. There is one surefire way, however, in which every new graduate can make a huge impact and change the world for the better: by unionizing your new workplace. Unions are for everyone. Despite popular imagination that only industrial workers need and deserve unions, every workplace can benefit from unionization, and every worker deserves a union — even Harvard alumni. After decades of right-wing attacks on workers’ rights, union density in the United States sits at historically low levels. In all likelihood, you will be entering a non-union workplace upon graduation — but you can fix that! Despite the lost ground of the labor movement, we are living through a historic moment of renewed labor organizing and victories. Workers across all sectors are fighting for their rights, and they are winning. From nurses to teachers, Kellogg’s to Google, Hollywood to John Deere, workers are organizing and demanding more from their employers. In the last year, workers at Starbucks and Amazon successfully formed the first unions within these behemoth corporations, with more soon to come. Public support for unions is soaring, now at its highest point in the United States since 1965. Unionization is also surging in white-collar professional work, such as nonprofit organizations, journalism, architecture, tech, media, and academia — the type of work that many Harvard graduates will pursue. By organizing in our new workplaces after graduation, we can achieve a meaningful material impact on our lives and the lives of others — and not just those of immediate coworkers. Unionization has ripple effects across the economy at large, raising wages and standards for both union and non-union workers. Additionally, organizing your workplace can help others organize theirs. As Alex Press writes for The Nation, “n ewly unionized white-collar workers provide dues to increasingly cash-strapped unions,” supplying critical support to other workplace struggles across various sectors. The change you can achieve through a union is not limited to pay and benefits. In July 2020, tens of thousands of workers walked off the job as part of the union-led Strike for Black Lives, committing to “withhold our most valuable asset — our labor — in support of dismantling racism and white supremacy to bring about fundamental changes in our society, economy and workplaces.” The Writers Guild of America, which represents TV and film writers, has flexed its muscles in opposition to Georgia’s 2021 racist voter-suppression bill and its 2019 anti-abortion legislation, threatening the withdrawal of Hollywood crews from the state, a popular filming location. Our very own Harvard Graduate Students Union, of which I am a proud member, fought and won new protections against caste-based discrimination and sexual harassment in our new contract. Although the Harvard administration remains recalcitrant on providing real recourse for survivors of sex- and gender-based harassment, discrimination, and violence, the union has been a powerful voice in continuing to demand justice. Unions also meaningfully strengthen democracy and give people more immediate democratic control over their lives. With democracy under siege worldwide, and American institutions and politicians increasingly unresponsive to the needs and desires of their constituents, the grassroots democracy that unions provide is essential. In addition, unions foster broader political participation. The labor movement was essential to the passage of some of the most important legislation of the 20th century, including the Social Security Act. Today, a revived labor movement can strengthen our collective power to dismantle white supremacy, combat climate change, and defeat right-wing authoritarianism. These are massive undertakings that would undoubtedly “hasten the world to better days.” They are also too big for any of us to tackle alone. In mere months, however, we can take action to begin this process of truly changing the world. To start, simply talk with your coworkers to understand the issues they care about and imagine how your workplace could be better. With a few colleagues on board, identify some unions that might be a good fit and reach out to a representative. With their help, you and your colleagues will be well on your way to a democratic workplace. Wherever we go after graduation, we can take these steps to change the world. All it takes is talking to your coworkers and bravely demanding more together. Joseph G. Leone is a second-year Master in Public Policy student at the Harvard Kennedy School."
rice_thresher_2022_16,"ByMoshe Vardi9/27/22 10:54pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. What is the purpose of universities, in general, and Rice University, in particular? This is a subject ofmuch debatethese days. Let me first offer a disciplinary perspective. I am an active member of the Association for Computing Machinery, the oldest and largest professional society dedicated to computing. The Associations’Code of Ethics and Professional Conductstates: “Computing professionals’ actions change the world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently supporting the public good.” So ethical computing has a responsibility to support the public good. Going back to the opening question, I believe that the core purpose of universities is to support the public good. What is the public good? My favorite definition wasprovidedby Hammurabi almost 4,000 years ago: “to further the well-being of mankind.” Let me offer some further historical background. In 2020, we celebrated the 75th anniversary of “Science, The Endless Frontier,” a highly influential report submitted in 1945 to President Truman by Vannevar Bush, an engineer and science administrator, who during World War II headed the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development. The report – which led to the establishment of the National Science Foundation – argued that scientific progress is essential to human progress – economic growth, healthcare, and national defense. Bush argued that this essential, new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research. He concluded that it is the role of the Federal Government to support the advancement of science. His philosophy can be summarized in one phrase: “Science for the public good.” Bush’s 1945 vision was revisited in 2020 in an article “Science Institutions for a Complex, Fast-Paced World,” by Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, and Michael M. Crow, president of Arizona State University. McNutt and Crow noted that, in the past 75 years, societal challenges—from nuclear proliferation to climate change to wealth concentration to social media’s impact on expertise and truth—”that have resulted, at least in part, from society’s application of scientific advances, are now subjects that science itself must directly help to solve.” They concluded that the institutions that carried out much of the scientific progress over the past 75 years must reassess their mission and be committed not only to advancing scientific knowledge, but also to addressing the societal problems that technology, driven by scientific knowledge, has created. In other words, focus on the public good, but in a broader sense. Rice’s Mission StatementdeclaresRice’s mission to be: “path-breaking research, unsurpassed teaching, and contribution to the betterment of our world”. I like this mission, but I’d have modified it slightly: “path-breaking research and unsurpassed teachingforbetterment of our world”. Betterment of the world, that is, contributing to the public good, must be the ultimate mission of Rice, I believe. In fact, even the branding phrase “unconventional wisdom”, is part of a longer statement: “Rice is a community… who believe that improving the world demands more than bold thought and brave action. It takes unconventional wisdom.” Improving the world is the goal; unconventional wisdom is the means. My choice for Rice’s branding phrase is “Research and education for the public good”. But I have yet to see many discussions at Rice that focus explicitly on Rice’s commitment to the public good. Scientific and technological progress does not automatically lead to societal progress. The interaction between technology, culture and society is extremely complicated, as we can see, for example, from the unexpected resistance to the COVID-19 vaccines. In 2019, Rice UniversitylaunchedanInitiative on Technology, Culture, and Society, whose goal is “to create a permanent intellectual and multidisciplinary locus of activities at Rice dedicated to the descriptive and prescriptive study of a socio-technical system — namely, how technology impacts society and culture, and how society responds to those impacts.” The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many planned events of the Initiative. With life on the Rice campus gradually returning to normal now, several Initiative events will take place this fall. It is my hope that these events will stimulate a vigorous campus conversation on technology, culture, and society, and, most importantly, on Rice’s commitment to the public good. How should this commitment impact our educational and research activities? There is much to discuss! April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_12,"Among the mostcommoncomplaints at today’s American dinner table is that “No one in Washington is talking about the issues that really matter.” As political elites jostle over narrow issues likeRINO-hoodand other partisan flashpoints, many Americans see Capitol Hill’s suit-wearers as overlooking more tangible concerns — like, say, low and decreasing economic mobility. This worrisome gap between Congress and the U.S. populace is one that Harvard can, by virtue of its many fingers in American politics, help fill, improving its own national image in the process. And, with anti-elite sentiment on the rise, improve Harvard must. The school’s strategy here should target both representation and outreach, taking care to build classes geographically representative of the U.S. and university initiatives that reflect a determination to leave no sect of our country overlooked. Symptoms of Harvard’s poor national outreach are easy to find. The school frequently fields attacks from populist talking heads (who are themselves emblematic of pervasive, defensive distrust among American voters . In late August, for example, Tucker Carlson gleefully ridiculed former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, a current visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Naturally, you would think Bill de Blasio would have a shining career as a homeless person himself after his time in office,” Carlson jeered on his eponymous talk show. “Well, there’s one place in America that would hire Bill de Blasio: Harvard University.” Perhaps it isn’t surprising that Harvard is a favorite target of Americans justly angry with broader political elitism — in addition to its aura of wealth and prestige, the school churns out national politicians like no other. At the dawn of the 117th Congress in 2021, 54 out of 435 voting members couldlay claimto a Harvard degree, 40 of whom were Democrats. In this sense, contempt for Harvard, in all its (purported Congress-controlling glory, looks a lot like contempt for the dimly lit cogs and wheels spinning in our nation’s capital. If its label as a retreat for coastal gentry isn’t sufficient reason to engage in some image rehab, Harvard has a moral obligation to care for the health of American democracy. Themissionof Harvard College, to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society,” has no meaning if those future leaders are seen by their constituents as totally indifferent to real human needs. Trust in institutions is the sine qua non of democratic stability; in a public sphere marked byrising polarization,increasingly inexperiencedleaders, andpartisan fracturing, continual distrust threatens total upheaval. This is not to say that Harvard and its students have not made meaningful steps toward connecting with Americans from areas underrepresented in the College. For one, the Institute of Politics presentlyhostsa former Wyoming governor and former West Virginia secretary of state as visiting fellows, importing valuable perspectives from two of Harvard’sleast commonstudent home states. In a similar vein, a new student organization called the Harvard Appalachian Student Association haslaunchedprogramming designed to promote higher education as attainable to Appalachian students, at top-ranking universities especially. Both initiatives promise to help draw Harvard’s institutional gaze toward neglected regions like Appalachia and the Mountain States, bridging the gap between Harvard and areas likely to hold political views associated with a higher incidence of resentment for elite universities (not to mention reducing Harvard students’seeming contemptfor lower-income, less educated, more conservative voting blocs . But there is more work to be done. For one, Harvard College Admissions should make geographic diversity a higher priority; as a 2015 Crimson featurereported, 51.5 percent of non-international Class of 2018 students were from New York, New Jersey, California, and Massachusetts, states which together hold 23.2 percent of the U.S. population. This is a grave failure. Harvard professors should make a more concerted effort to create curriculums representative of America as a whole, too — if economic convergence between the U.S. and China offered a good case study for the several-hundred-person Econ 10B: Principles of Economics class, so too couldconvergencebetween underserved Appalachia and its more prosperous neighbors. With just a few targeted efforts, the University can simultaneously fortify its reputation against populist vitriol and fulfill its self-professed mission to support American democracy and educate its leaders. An insular Harvard helps no one but its direct affiliates, but a Harvard whose institutions embody humility and open-mindedness has the capacity to pacify some of our country’s deepest and most destructive fault lines.

stanforddaily_2022_39,"Before my Gung Gung (公公 grandfather died, perhaps knowing his health was in decline, he tried to share some of his wisdom with me. My sister and I sat in his Hong Kong apartment and listened while he described at length the lessons he learned in his lifetime. To this day, I regret that I did not fully understand what he was saying. He died in 2006, just before I started as a frosh at Stanford, leaving my Poh Poh (婆婆 grandmother as my sole surviving grandparent. Determined to have a real conversation with her one day, I flipped through the course catalog and saw that Cantonese language classes were offered at Stanford. Maybe it wasn’t too late for me after all? The problem was, the conversational Cantonese classes could not be used to fulfill the undergraduate language requirement (they teach listening and speaking, but not reading and writing . I felt like I had to choose between learning the language of my family, and learning a ‘real’ language – one that fulfilled degree requirements. This didn’t seem fair to me when Cantonese was as much a language as any of the others taught on campus. Then a message came through my inbox: a Stanford student was petitioning for a 5-credit Cantonese class to fulfill the language requirement and needed to find students who would commit to take the class with reading and writing – a one-time opportunity. If enough students committed, a comprehensive Cantonese course would be offered for the very first time, with support from the Provost. I wrote back immediately; this was my chance. Those classes with Dr. Sik Lee Dennig turned out to be life-changing. Learning Cantonese changed my relationships with my Poh Poh, my family, and my community. The language helped me access my heritage and unlearn some of the shame I absorbed from growing up Cantonese in an America that didn’t want me to speak it. I enrolled without realizing how lucky I was: 2006-2007 would be the first and only year that Cantonese courses would fulfill the language requirement since the program first started in 1997. Until recently, I assumed it would also be the last. In 2017, yetanother Stanford studentasked why Cantonese courses could not be used to fulfill the language requirement, but no such courses were offered. Then in 2020, COVID-19 budget cuts put Stanford’s conversational Cantonese classes injeopardy. So I started the Save Cantonese at Stanford campaign to ensure future students would have the same chance I did. And they just might. Now, with the help of apetition, anASSU resolution,donor interest, and the launch of theSave Cantonese movement, Cantonese courses at Stanford will finally fulfill the language requirement for the first time in 15 years, putting it on equal footing with other languages taught on campus. The symbolic importance of this change cannot be understated. Students who enroll in First Year Cantonese will now have the opportunity to acquire all four critical language skills: speaking, listening, (and finally reading and writing. However, one year of Cantonese is not enough to achieve research or professional levels of fluency. Intermediate and Advanced conversational courses allow continuing students to reach higher levels of proficiency and heritage speakers to improve their ancestral tongue. But these classes are not guaranteed for the future. Only enrollment numbers can prove to the University that there is ongoing student demand for Cantonese. We need Cantonese literacy at Stanford. Learning to read and write Chinese characters benefits students by tying Cantonese to other Chinese languages, and introduces them torich vocabulary and characters unique to Cantonesethat do not exist in Mandarin. Cantonese proficiency is key for scholarship in the context ofAsian American Studies,research, andArt Initiativesat Stanford, especially for researchers studyingearly Chinese AmericanimmigrantsandChinatown communities. The unique vocal and rhyming tones of Cantonese and its use of Traditional Chinese characters facilitate the study and interpretation of countless poems and inscriptions found in disparate places such asAngel Islandand mining towns throughout theAmerican West. Cantonese literacy is also necessary to read archival material tied to the Archaeology Center’sSan Jose Chinatown Project, to provide effective Hepatitis B outreach at the Medical School’sAsian Liver Center, and to conduct high-qualityequity research in the School of Education. High levels of Cantonese proficiency help future social workers, physicians, andlawyersworking with immigrant communities. It serves future business and government professionals who wish to build ties with Hong Kong and southeast Asia. The three Cantonese courses now available at Stanford exist because our community willed them into existence. The addition of a new class that fulfills the language requirement in 2022 builds upon the years of student lobbying that first led to the creation of the Cantonese language program in 1997. But the only way to ensure that these courses are offered in the future is to enroll. We need to show the University thatstudents value minority languages. Minority languages are necessary not just to maintain Stanford’s place as a top-tier research institution, but also for our sense of dignity and belonging: to show that minority languages have a place at Stanford, and that no language is more prestigious or more legitimate than another. Despite growing up with Cantonese, I remember being told repeatedly that it wasn’t worth learning. They said it wasn’t a proper language, like Mandarin or English. They said it wasn’t “useful”—that it would die out eventually. I heard it from family members; I heard it from teachers; and in a way, I heard it from Stanford too. Here is our opportunity to unlearn that shame, to show that just like every person has a place at Stanford, so does every language, and on equal terms. The future of Cantonese at Stanford depends on your enrollment. Let’s prove them wrong.

thetech_mit_2022_37,"As someone who has spent the better part of five decades in and around of MIT, I feel the need to express my concerns — and really, my sadness and disappointment — over the administration’s recent tendency to lock down, control, and shut off access to our campus. Despite public statements and public relations campaigns proclaiming the importance of community, openness, and caring, the reality on the ground demonstrates just the opposite: increasingly, the university is closing itself off from our neighbors. This trend began long before the current pandemic. I first noticed it when sections of Building 6 were closed, even to MIT ID holders, presumably because the newly renovated lobby spaces had become too nice to allow random riffraff to enjoy. Over the past two years, this trend has accelerated to the point where all entries to campus are now locked behind ID scanners. And now, just when it seems possible that we may be returning to some semblance of pre-pandemic life, the installation of new scanners to replace the temporary gates at the main entrance of Building 7 signals a chilling new normal: Fortress MIT. I’ve worked here for 15 years and have been a resident of the neighborhood for nearly my entire life. I have always been impressed and proud of the Institute s commitment to open access, both intellectual and physical. Over this time, despite the challenges of maintaining our research labs and keeping our students safe, we have continually nurtured a generally friendly and open campus environment, where everyone (student, faculty, staff, visitor, neighborhood resident, or even tourist was made to feel welcome and included. Our libraries allowed locals to browse, sit, read, and learn; our classrooms and lecture halls welcomed the neighborhood for public talks and performances; our hallways, lobbies, bathrooms, and water fountains served everyone, regardless of ID or status, at any time of day or night; surplus food was put out for the taking, feeding the hungry and preventing waste; and our doors were open, allowing everyone to navigate through the maze of campus as they needed, without unnecessary barriers, suspicion, or surveillance. I know that the recent pandemic created concerns over the need to “secure” campus (although my own sense is that many of those concerns were overplayed . But to allow this unfortunate moment to be used as an opportunity topermanentlyinstall card scanners and locks on every exterior access point (and even some interior ones — bathrooms, classrooms, and special study spaces is truly disheartening, and more than a little disingenuous as well. Take a moment to ponder the Orwellian irony of the new “Dynamic Engagement Node” on the Restricted Infinite Corridor: how much dynamism or engagement do we expect to happen, locked behind not one buttwocard scanners? COVID-19 alone does not provide a justification for these changes — and you’ll of course note that nearly all of our students and faculty regularly leave campus and visit neighboring restaurants and other buildings, which are open to the public. To lock off our campus sends the wrong message to our own community, suggesting we need to be insulated from those around us, to protect ourselves through isolation rather than connection. It’s also inconvenient and patently silly to boot: other than causing confusion and delay, do we really think that non-cardholders can’t figure out how to get through this absurdly ineffective security system? But worst of all, it serves as an insulting slap in the face to our host communities, which (to be honest have much more to fear from us than we have to fear from them, between institutional expansion and displacement, disruptive parties and events, nuclear and biotech hazards, or even campus visits from influential individuals of questionable character. I’d love to learn that my fears of a permanent MIT security state are overblown, and am eager to hear of plans to return to the old normal as soon as possible. At the very least, it would be good to learn that the administration is making these changes in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including students and staff as well as neighbors and community partners. In the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP , we teach this as basic “Community Planning 101.” Unfortunately, from what I can tell, there hasn’t been much open discussion to date. (And for those inclined to skepticism, it’s worth noting that the installation of the new Lobby 7 scanner during the dead of summer suggests a less-than-open process. We know that the work of hands and minds need not be cut off from the wisdom, love, commitment, and bravery we find in our hearts. Sadly, students in the senior Class of 2023 now represent the only remaining undergraduates who may remember the unfettered magic of the “pre-scanner” campus, an MIT that represented this spirit of open learning, free and generous sharing, and a broader, unselfish caring. Before these last embers of community and inclusion are extinguished, let’s remember these feelings and act on them. Let’s reopen our minds, our hearts, and our doors.

crimson_2022_117,"For most Asian Americans, racism isn’t being hit in the back of the head with a crowbar in New York City. It isn’t the violent horror stories you see in the news. To many of us, racism is mundane. It’s unremarkable. It’s simply a passing part of day-to-day life. It’s a low hum in the background that we have learned to tune out over time. I can still remember when I made this realization: the first time I was called a slur by a stranger. It was only a few weeks ago, at 9:30 p.m. I had just finished eating at a Korean restaurant in Allston with a group of five friends. Five of us, including myself, were Korean; the last member of our group was Chinese. Within 50 feet of exiting the restaurant and stepping out onto the dreary sidewalk, I saw a pair of white men, cladden with sweatpants and unkempt beards that showed hints of whitening. They were smirking casually, almost drunkenly. As we passed, they offered each of my friends and I a small nod and sloppy, slurred “ni hao.” First came the bewildered confusion. Quickly after, though, came the anger. I began to feel a burning in the bottom of my chest, but as I began to raise a righteous finger in protest, my friends lowered my hand. After we took a few more steps, one of them told me, “it’s not worth it.” As we stopped at the corner up ahead to wait for the crosswalk light to change, I turned to my friends and said, “I can’t believe that just happened.” My friend turned back towards me, eyebrows raised, and remarked, “you haven’t been called the c-word before?” The most surprising part of the whole incident, to me at least, wasn’t being labeled Chinese by a stranger with zero prompting (and to be clear, there’s nothing wrong with being Chinese; the problem is the deliberate belittlement of my Korean heritage by diminishing all East Asians to simply “Chinese” . I knew that being racially insulted was only a matter of time once I returned to the U.S. I was surprised by the nonchalant reactions of my friends. To them, this was normal — hardly worth addressing. As we stood at the crosswalk, the mood was somber, but the topic of conversation quickly moved on. Within a minute, it was as if the past few moments had never happened. We never talked about it again. In retrospect, I realize that the reason this was my first time remembering being called a slur is because I moved from New York to Korea in eighth grade. In other words, I had left the states before I really understood what it meant to be called a slur. For minorities in America, however, slurs are just a part of life. Even as I’ve been writing this op-ed, a Chinese friend came up to me and informed me that he had been called out with racist comments more times than he could count. The Asian American experience with racism isn’t just the muggings or shootings you see on the news. After all, the two men didn’t get in our faces. They didn’t follow us as we passed by. They didn’t shove any of us or throw a punch. The Asian American experience with racism is the fact that I wasn’t all that surprised by randomly being labeled Chinese. It’s the way that my friends treated the incident as if it was hardly worth mentioning and how we’ve never talked about what happened afterwards. It’s how in the face of blatant, explicit racism, my friends’ instinctual reaction was to internalize it and pretend it never happened. The Asian American experience with racism includes the fear of escalation that prompted my friends to lower my hand, not just the violence that may have resulted had they not done so. It’s a fear that is mundane and omnipresent: a faint, usually unnoticeable worry that permeates all aspects of life. To many Asian Americans, racism has become a normalized fact of being. It’s not always — in fact, it’s usually not — as explicit as it was that night in Allston. The way I usually encounter racism is when people ask me if I’m a U.S. citizen even after hearing my perfect English for an entire conversation. It’s when I think back to when a classmate complimented how smart I was in third grade and I’m no longer sure if it was a comment based purely on my merits as an individual. It’s a less visible kind of racism than the hate crimes that make the news. It’s also a less terrifying kind of racism, but an exponentially more tiresome one. It adds a tiny weight to every aspect of your life; even though the added weight is usually unnoticeably small, when it’s aggregated over every day and every week, it becomes exhausting. It’s a quiet, subtle kind of racism, but one that is utterly inescapable: a kind of racism that you fail to notice until you are called a chink by a stranger in Allston and — like a crescendoing wave — it hits you all at once.

state_press_2022_62,"To create long-term change, a more dynamic, left-wing political style that actually supports the working class both locally and internationally is needed. Crucial Arizona midterm elections are approaching, and while Mark Kelly and Katie Hobbs are clearly better candidates than Blake Masters and Kari Lake because of their policy positions, their brand of modern liberalism is doomed to fail against right-wing authoritarianism in the long run. To create long-term change, a more dynamic, left-wing political style that actually supports the working class locally and internationally is needed. Kelly, a former astronaut and now one of two Arizona Senators, has supported right-wing ideas about immigration. Heopposedthe Biden administration s move to end the Title 42 policy that enabled officials to turn away asylum-seekers in the name of public health, according to NBC News. Kelly has also embraced Customs and Border Protection byintroducinglegislationwith Republicans to boost Border Patrol pay and create a Border Patrol reserve. While Hobbs has attempted to take a more progressive route on immigration, she contradicts herself with her support of policies such asTitle 42. She has described thesouthern borderas a place of lawlessness and chaos. This is an avid display of her lack of understanding of thehistory of colonialismand climate change that has led to large-scale immigration in the first place. Not only has Hobbs played into right-wing ideas aboutborders, she has done the same with police. Just two years after the murder of George Floyd,among countless other instances of police brutality, spurred potentiallythe largest racial justice movement in the U.S. historysince the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Hobbs has leaned heavily into campaign ads in support of the police. She has also leaned into ads about abortion rights, and rightfully so. But, how can she simultaneously lean into support for police that will be enforcing the Supreme Court decision removing rights to abortion while also running ads supporting abortion rights? It is a contradiction. The choice to support right-wing ideas and those who enforce them is antithetical to creating an effective opposition to right-wing authoritarians such as Lake and Masters. The opposition must be against the modern nation-state ideas about borders that drive working-class division and antagonism. As Canadian author and activist, Harsha Walia,said in an interview withThe Guardian,Borders maintain racial citizenship and create a pool of hyper-exploitable cheapened labor. When racist nationalists such asDonald Trump stoke fearabout people from the Global South stealing jobs, they, of course, are not doing it in support of working people. They are doing it out of racism that they know will destroy international working-class solidarity and create further opportunities for public service cuts and privatization, which means greater profits for executives and worse conditions for workers. Finn Howe, a sophomore studying computer science and the vice-chair for Young Democratic Socialists of America at ASU, saidhe will be voting for both Hobbs and Kelly in the midterms, but has some reservations. We don t want to see Kari Lake win; however, that doesn t mean that we re excited about Katie Hobbs, Howe said. I don t think she s doing a great job of communicating what sort of progressive change she would bring, besides just not being Kari Lake. On the subject of Masters, Howe said, I believe a lot of people like myself will go out and vote for Mark Kelly, just so Blake Masters doesn t win, but it s not really a great strategy for actually getting progressive goals accomplished. In order to defeat right-wing authoritarianism in the long run, it isn t enough just to vote against Republican candidates — we must also look beyond modern liberalism and toward left-wing politics that reject right-wing, capitalist strategies.

crimson_2022_0,"We are second-year students at the Harvard Kennedy School, and we are calling on the University administration to do right by the hundreds of Master in Public Policy, Master in Public Administration, and Master in Public Administration in International Development candidates in the Class of 2022 whose educations have been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. We urge the administration to let us extend our time on campus by giving our class a “flex semester” option — the same option that was offered to the Class of 2021, who faced similar disruptions as we did. In light of the uncertain impact of the pandemic on our spring, the flex semester is the safest way to help us make the most of our severely impacted graduate school experience. For the majority of our time at the Kennedy School, we’ve been largely cut off from what makes HKS special: the people and the community they create together. We’ve had fewer opportunities to learn from our peers, less time to build relationships with faculty and staff, and limited access to research centers, guest speakers, and career events. Our academic learning, our social experience, and our professional development — all together culminating in the quality of our education — have suffered. Surging Covid-19 caseloads could send us back to online learning at any point in this semester. We support a strong public health response to safeguard the wellbeing of the campus community and of our neighbors in Cambridge, Boston, and beyond. But we expect the administration to work with us to find creative, meaningful ways to make the most of our Kennedy School experience — which we’ve paid full tuition to receive. A flex semester option would allow us to make up for what was lost by extending our time on campus by one extra “flex” semester — either next fall or next spring — without having to pay additional tuition. The administration rightly offered this option to the Class of 2021, but so far has denied our requests for similar treatment, despite the fact that we have now spent a similar amount of time in Zoom school as the previous class did. In multiple meetings since October, the Kennedy School leadership has made us aware that offering a flex semester would have a negative impact on the HKS community, without providing much detail on the flex semester’s challenges or how we could manage them. The presence of Class of 2021 flex students on campus last fall should tell us that these challenges can, in fact, be overcome. We’re disappointed that our extended presence at HKS is seen by the administration as a burden, when we feel that allowing our class to stay on campus for one more semester would greatly benefit the Kennedy School community. We’ve experienced firsthand how sharing campus with current flex students has enriched our learning, in and out of the classroom. Many students in the Class of 2023 understand this, too; we’re grateful to the 166 first-year students who signeda solidarity petitioncalling on the administration to offer us a flex semester. When we accepted our offers of admission to the Kennedy School in the spring of 2020, we did so in the face of significant uncertainty. Much like today, Covid-19 cases were surging, our family members and friends were getting sick, and economies around the world were shutting down. And yet, deferring our education wasn’t an option for most of us: we had given up jobs, made plans to move our families across the globe, or spent years applying for scholarships to be able to attend Harvard. We knew that we might face restrictions and the possibility of online learning for some time. But we committed to the Harvard Kennedy School because we expected every effort on the part of the University to provide us with the world-class education that drew us here in the first place. We’re tremendously grateful to the administrators, faculty, staff, and our classmates for working so hard to make the most of our time together, while protecting public health. Nonetheless, we feel that the University’s actions so far have failed to deliver the education we paid to receive. For the dozens of students who expressed interest in a flex semester, offering this option is a meaningful way to make up for the disruptions caused to our education by the Covid-19 pandemic. We also know that not everyone will be able to extend their education by one semester. That’s why we urge University leaders to continue doing all they can to ensure that classes are held safely in-person this spring, and to consider other accommodations for students who can’t take a flex semester. In light of the Kennedy School’srecent budget surplus, such accommodations could include reduced or refunded tuition for any additional time we spend learning online, or expanded alumni benefits and social programming for the Class of 2022. We want to partner with student government and the administration to develop a safe and effective flex option that works for everyone involved. As we head into our final spring semester at the Kennedy School, we’re convinced that this is the right and fair thing to do, both for our class and for the Kennedy School community at large.

thetech_mit_2022_21,"Last fall, President Reif charged the provost, chancellor, and chair of the faculty to examine the state of freedom of expression on campus “on behalf of the community.” The process that led to the Freedom of Expressionstatementandreportgrossly failed President Reif’s call to “ensure that different points of view … are allowed to be heard and debated on our campus” — words he wrote in hisletterintroducing the statement and report to the MIT community. The last time I checked, students are a core part of “our campus.” Where are the students in the creation of the Freedom of Expression statement and report? The composition of theAd Hoc Working Group on Free Expressionshould upset students. First, the committee included just two students, one undergraduate student — me — and one graduate student. These students were not “members” of the committee. Instead, students were relegated to the subordinate position of “partner” and did not enjoy the same rights and privileges as actual members. Delegating students to a lower class via a partner designation and faculty and administration to a higher class via a member designation violates the opportunity for students’ “points of view … to be heard and debated on our campus.” As a so-called partner, I was given a less than 24-hour notice of the statement and report going public, which diminished any opportunity to meaningfully have the student point of view “heard and debated.” Manufacturing who wields power and who holds a megaphone contaminates and voids any outputs of this group. Are students being asked to accept the results of an illegitimate working group? I hope not. Are students to believe that this group speaks of freedom of expression when this very group’s foundation is void of freedom of expression in its committee composition? No. If a working group does not allow freedom of expression in its composition, are students to believe any outputs of such a group are fair or legitimate? No. Like President Reif after signing anEpstein thank you letter, I too regret that the Freedom of Expression report bears my name as an undergraduate partner. As a partner, I was directed to not engage students and to synthesize only limited undergraduate sentiments drawn from the Carlson Lecture. As an undergraduate partner to the working group and as the Undergraduate Association (UA President, I believe that the absence of fair, meaningful inclusion of students in the creation of the report precludes any student agreeance to the statement and report that is supposedly “on behalf of the community.” I worry that my myopic inclusion as the undergraduate partner allows the working group to wrongly benefit from the UA’s credibility amongst undergraduates and to advertise student buy-in when in fact students were deprived of meaningful engagement and representation. I voice my stark dissent. There cannot be a Freedom of Expression statement and report without freedom of expression. Freedom of expression must include having students at parity with other community members. Setting aside my procedural grievances, I am worried about the content of the Freedom of Expression report. First, the Freedom of Expression report fails to properly consider, let alone assign weight to, the many places speech can occur. Should speech look different in an academic versus residential setting, considering the primary purposes of such places differ? Residential settings serve as students’ ultimate retreat. Unlike speech in the classroom or on the campus grounds where students can stay or exit as they see fit, speech in residential settings inherently has a captive audience. I would not expect it to be acceptable to barge into President Reif’s Gray House anytime I wish to voice my speech, nor should students be expected to have their homes violated in the same manner. More work and discussion is imperative to understand the implications of free speech in different scenarios, taking into account the time, place, and manner of the speech. Second, the Freedom of Expression report fails to safeguard students against the harms of power differentials. The report believes “empowering our students to be confident advocates who refuse to be silenced” is the appropriate response to speech that chills or silences the voices of marginalized minority groups. I will offer one personal example to illustrate my argument. In spring 2022, I took a required Course 17 class where my teaching assistant said hurtful things to my classmates and me. For example, when I spoke about my queer identity, said TA berated me, asking,“What makes you a minority?” Never in my Latinx, immigrant, genderqueer, gay, disabled, low-income life would I imagine having to defend myself against such an invalidating question. I did not feel comfortable with the remarks of this TA, so I reported the behavior to my professor and department chair and filed a report through the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response Office (IDHR . The result? My department chair never followed up on the matter. My professor leaked the contents of my email to the TA without my consent. IDHR told me they could not take action on the case. As a student, I could not continue with the class. What protections would I, as a student, have in a scenario like this? Is this the new hallmark of a MIT education? Real or not, I had a sincerely held perception that I was not and could not be treated fairly in this class. I use this example to show that this Freedom of Expression report would allow my TA to say such harmful comments and to create a hostile academic environment and fails to protect a student like me from the harms of power differentials. While I would like to consider myself an okay exemplar of a “confident advocate,” I did not achieve an acceptable outcome to my situation. I can only imagine how students without my level of comfort in advocating for myself would fare in such a situation. A belief that students should simply advocate in the face of such situations negligently fails to wrestle with the unsettling realities behind power differentials. Such a belief fails students. Third, the Freedom of Expression report is too long. How accessible is a 56-page report? Really? While tremendous opportunities have been provided to faculty to engage with the report, I have not seen the same opportunities afforded to students. I find this worrisome since sections of the report that are potentially highly impactful to students are buried to a point where they fail to rise to the surface for discussion and debate. Once again, I see an instance where students are not being meaningfully engaged. “To give free expression prominence not only in our policies but also in the life of the Institute means making it an integral part of our educational mission.” This line in thereportsignals an intent to spread the ideas of the Freedom of Expression report all throughout the Institute. Such an intent should be worrisome for students because of the procedural and content grievances that I have outlined. To students, let me be clear: be aware, be alarmed, and be resistant to a statement that does not and cannot speak “on behalf of the community” without us. A community without students is not the MIT community. David Spicer is a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Political Science. He serves as President of the Undergraduate Association and was the sole undergraduate partner to the Ad Hoc Working Group on Free Expression."
crimson_2022_101,"Like so much of what runs rampant on Instagram (and other social media platforms , this title is clickbait. It doesn’t capture the complexity of the discourse surrounding social media platforms — it can’t! — but the blunt overconfidence of the simple statement “Instagram bad” is enough to get a click and generate interest in what seems to be such a bold or bad take. Our busy lives necessitate that we cannot consume all the content we want ad infinitum. After all, in a world full of so much (and ever increasing content and data, but limited time, we have to decide what to consume based on some kind of metric. Clickbait capitalizes on ournatural tendenciesto interact with the eye-catching. But in the process, nuance can be lost, and important, multifaceted issues can be stripped of their sensitivity. This can lead to misinformation, which, especially amid a pandemic, can be fatal. Despite the attempts of social media platforms to curb misinformation — Instagram notablytagsstories and posts related to the pandemic with a Covid-19 disclaimer — it can still be difficult to differentiate truth from fiction. Yes, you can usually evaluate whether information comes from a reputable source by checking its publishing credentials, but when you’re just tapping through Instagram stories, looking at screenshots of screenshots, this can once again be difficult. Sharing the sources of information — say through hyperlinks — can, however, help. Instagram recently began rolling out the feature for anyone to addclickable hyperlinksto their stories. But this feature being rolled out en masse comes after years ofonlyaccounts with at least 10,000 followers (or those verified being able to add a swipe-up hyperlink to their stories. Did this follower threshold exist as a means of combating misinformation under the assumption that large accounts must have their followings for good reason? What was stopping large accounts from not only sharing misinformation, but also amplifying it to at least 10,000 people? The original and continued draw of Instagram is its emphasis on visual communication, through the sharing of pictures and videos as posts and stories. Though posts have captions, these captions are typically not the focus; the post itself is usually centered, and captions are currently capped at 2,200 characters. Prioritizing visual images over written text can cause many to instead share information in posts of infographics or digital posters, but the inability to add hyperlinks to posts themselves or have URLs in captions be clickable hyperlinks is another barrier to easier fact-checking and citing sources as a means of mitigating misinformation. Though there is no guarantee that users will always cite their sources, having the ability to cite them in the first place via clickable hyperlinks in posts or captions can at least prompt viewers to wonder why sources are not cited upon viewing their next post. Although this might seem overly fastidious, even small barriers that prevent information from being better cited and sourced can cause issues on a much larger scale. Instagram (which was acquired by Facebook, nowMeta, in2012 hadmore than two billion monthly usersas of December 2021. That’s at least 150 times more than the number of vehicles that crossed the Golden Gate Bridge last year. Even if this barrier to well-sourced information only impacted a miniscule 0.05 percent of Instagram users, that’s still around a million people. If it was easier for users to directly share links to topics that they’re posting about, combating misinformation might be easier for both moderators and individuals. People might still post unscrupulous hyperlinks or direct others to malicious websites, but this can be mitigated bybetter moderationfrom the side of Instagram itself. This exemplifies a much-needed two-pronged approach to controlling misinformation on Instagram: the ability for users to hyperlink and cite sources better, while at the same time Instagram’s own content moderators ensuring that those links are not harmful. Especially amid the Omicron subvariant of Covid-19, BA.2, which appears to bespreadingin America, Instagram — and all social media platforms — must do more to combat misinformation about vaccines, masking, and other public health measures. As students at many colleges, including Harvard, return to campus after spring break, more data about cases, testing, and positivity rates will likely be available. However, with a new variant and new data, there is always room for misinformation. Although Instagram puts a disclaimer on Covid-related posts, the platform itself can do so much more to combat pandemic misinformation. Hopefully, with more robust sourcing of posts, clickbait (like the title of this piece can be regarded with more reflection. If you’re able to link your sources on Instagram, do so. Even if you can’t, consider content with a closer look. In a semester filled with so much uncertainty, accurate information is all the more important. Pictures might be worth a thousand words, but those words should be accurate, not a facade.

Depending on where you start, you may pass anything from patches of yellowed grass, to an unassuming dorm building, to something you might see in the gallery of “Best Places to Visit at Stanford” on TripAdvisor. If it’s not the sandstone arcades and columns of Main Quad, then it is the Engineering Quad’s sleek, glassy design, the downhill slopes to the Oval, the ivy-covered terrace of Stanford Law School. For every expanse captured on camera, there is some quiet, treasured pocket of space — whether that’s the warm, inviting lounge of the Hume Center, or a comfortable nap in Meyer Green under the watchful shade of the “Churro” statue. At least there would be, if this were a write-up for a handmade travel blog of ideal study spaces, complete with lush, well-angled photographs at the most opportune time of the day. A space is much more than its aesthetic value — it encompasses how we commit to our work and how we remember it long afterwards. The law terraces are sublime, until the sun goes down — then it’s just a ticking clock to see which body part can freeze first. Coho is ambient and upbeat until someone spills an iced latte across your keyboard, followed by a cascade of crumbs. To avoid the swells of voices that occasionally rise up in Huang Basement, we plug in our earbuds — but then the music distracts us, more captivating in its rhythm than whatever we have pulled up on our laptop screen. What is our space? What makes one space the key to our answers, while another is essentially a self-imposed challenge of how fast time can slip down the drain? What better guides our focus: the background ambience of Zoom study rooms, or a playlist of ambiguous, peaceful sounds from which we can’t name a single song? Some of us can plow through an essay with music blasting at full volume, entrapped in freezing daylight; others can only helplessly reload our emails at the slightest disturbance in the background, or latch onto the first notification on our phone as a much-needed break from scraping away at p-sets. Amid the omicron variant, mired neck-deep in midterms, we rarely agree on what makes an ideal space for dedication and attention to our studies. Perhaps we can agree that there has never been one. What is the point of a ranked list of study spots or the beauty of the photograph, if it all fades away when we try to put pen to paper? A space of study is meant for focus. Losing ourselves in our work is a detachment of our mind from our senses; the sun-dappled ponds of Kingscote Gardens hold as much merit as the growing espresso stain on a table outside Coupa Cafe. Yet we are drawn to the aesthetic, the welcoming, warm designs. Perhaps it places us in a better mindset as a constant reminder that, regardless of the frustration of our studies, the space itself is always a source of comfort. The fluctuating buzz of life in the dining halls assures us that we are not alone in our challenges; our favorite playlist is our stabilizer and heartbeat. There is a reminder of other people’s spaces, and how they overlap with our own. Beyond the sound and the sight, space is our memory. I first stepped foot into McClatchy Hall as a visitor nearly three years ago; it still amazes me that I can walk in now as a student. One may treasure the firepit near Lake Lagunita when the grass first ripples into rushes of green; their earliest dorms, the first class they ever had, the first stacks they lost themselves in — these all are immutable. With COVID, many of these spaces are sealed, their memories pinched away, and with them all the aesthetics and sounds that make their essence timeless. Space, in a way, is our legacy. It is a way to leave a trace of ourselves behind, and a way to reclaim that piece of ourselves if we desire so. With isolation policies, the tragic losses of students, the volatile times that we shape ourselves in, how we approach our space as comfort, stability and even inspiration is something that extends beyond the four walls of a room, or the scenery outside. Every day we struggle to carve our space. We make minute adjustments to accommodate our preferences, and we change our space to invite others in. It is not an active decision so much as an innate one, and it is something always worth considering when it comes to how Stanford approaches its next objective in satisfying the values and needs of its students. Our space is what we make of it: not so much ofwhereit is and how it looks, but the impressions that we gather and leave behind."
rice_thresher_2022_57,"ByEli Mendoza2/22/22 11:23pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. While I wasn’t able to attend the Senate meeting on Feb. 7, I read the minutes of the meeting and am severely disappointed in the Student Association’s response to the comments of Rice Swim coach Seth Huston on the “controversy” surrounding transgender athletes. I’m attempting to share my perspective on the situation as a trans student and former athlete/coach. The University must actively denounce transphobia and other forms of bigotry in the future if it wishes to uphold a value of equity on its campus. I readthe entire articlethe day it was released, and it was based in transphobia. This isn’t hindsight bias; you can check my Twitter. It was not “out of context,” as the swim team’s statement says. Transphobic arguments are not negated by an obligatory “well I’m fine with her.’’ This is not a statement of acceptance: to do so would be truly taking it out of context. It is a way to avoid pushback and seem socially acceptable. This is what people do to cover racism and homophobia (i.e, “I’m ok with them being married, but they shouldn’t be allowed to adopt kids’’ or “I’m ok with diversity, but it’s not fair they got into college instead of me” . It’s putting lipstick on a pig. If Huston is truly ok with transwomen like Lia Thomas competing in women’s divisions, there would be no need for unprompted commentary. The NCAA is his supposedly main concern. Yet since at least 2011 the NCAA guidelines for transwomen followed international rules for guidelines set in 2003, requiring proof of social transition and a reduction in testosterone levels, something pretty achievable if given the resources. In other words, it’sbeenfigured out for over a decade. The NCAA only started to vary from international guidelinesin the past yearafter the “controversy” surrounding Lia Thomas. These changes show that while the NCAA allowed Thomas to compete, they didn’t actually want her to do well. It shows that to them, us winning must be because of biology, not because we actually have skill. Michael Phelpsfamously has a biological advantagethat helps him be an extremely proficient swimmer, but this is praised as genetic superiority, not unfairness. Numerous other cisgender athletes have well-known biological advantages that are cultivated and encouraged instead of affecting the “integrity” of the sport. Phelps’ advantage combined with his hard work is what got him where he was, not the advantage itself. Non-binary students are still forced to pick a gendered team in most cases. In my previous sport, karate, divisions weren’t gendered until adult levels. In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, where youth divisions are gendered, I competed on boys’ teams after being the only “girl,” no complaints. I wasn’t “dominated,” either. My experience has always been that any biological advantage can only get you so far without hard work, regardless of gender. Additionally, the comments of cis students should not have equal footing with the comments of trans students, who can’t participate in sports in many states, including ours, anymore. There was minimal evidence of moderation in the minutes, and attendees I spoke with called it “chaos.” The lack of immediate moderation is complacent and makes these discussions dangerous to the people they are supposedly trying to protect. The common refrain of “protecting the integrity of women’s sports” is textbook transphobia. The fact that this comment went unchecked by the SA is unacceptable. I know multiple trans students at Rice who wanted to join sports teams but don’t feel safe, quit, or with sports like gymnastics or swimming, the uniform is a source of dysphoria. We worry about the very reactions people have towards Thomas, and these “discussions” show that we have every right to be. Somehow men and women are equal until trans people exist. Testosterone is a hormone that does correlate with traits associated with people who have male puberty, but everyone has it. Look at a modern bell curve of hormones and gender: there is a significant overlap between assigned male at birth and assigned female at birth levels of estrogen and testosterone. Many people also have conditions that give them extra or less of these hormones than the usual pool. These people, when “cis,” are not forced to switch teams. Many people don’t even know their own hormone levels, and these policies alsohurt cisgender women. While the conversation regarding how to de-gender our current system is complex and important, it should not be led by transphobia. Further, trans people’s humanity and right to participate isnotpart of the discussion. Coaches need to focus on supporting their athletes, not obsessing over the competition. However, many in the sports world share Coach Huston’s perspective, and some will fully admit they don’t understand the issues yet make bold statements as if they do. These conversations often lack the inclusion of transgender and intersex individuals and arenotrespectful. Not everyone needs to speak on every subject: stick to what you know, and listen when you don’t. If you beg for respectful discussion, then be respectful. After reading this, I hope some of you learned something, even if you don’t agree with me. I’d like to add that I don’t mean to promote any negative action towards or speak in bad faith of the SA or Rice Swimming. I have chosen a direct tone because addressing this as if it’s a new phenomenon would be allowing for future incidents to occur. The University needs to actively denounce transphobia, staff should be given resources to be educated, and conversations need to be moderated if they are to be respectful. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

wildcat_arizona_2022_82,"A digital illustration of an airplane traveling around planet Earth. Whether someone is traveling around their city, state, country or abroad, traveling comes with so many benefits. Traveling, especially as a college student, is one of the best ways to experience new cultures. According toTravelex, traveling can help people become more independent, boost happiness and reduce stress. Traveling with friends, family or yourself is easier than ever because of different cities’ transportation systems. Examples of these technologies include Uber, as well as multiple other travel options like trains, buses, airplanes, etc. Many places, like museums, have student discounts and all you need is to show your university ID. A fun way to see the country is by going to national parks. There are fees to get into most national parks, monuments and battlefields; however, there is a U.S. Park Pass which is $80 a year and using it can get someone into all national parks, monuments and battlefields, according toMap & List – US.. Park Pass. Traveling as a college student is easier than ever, and there are so many programs out there to help students save money abroad, likeStudentUniverse. Students can also study abroad during the school year and over the summer. Based on theUniversity of Arizona International Admissionswebsite, over 5,400 students learn abroad every year at over 650 Microcampuses around the world, and there are multiple scholarships for students who wish to study overseas. Studying abroad also looks excellent on resumés for applying to jobs after graduation. Even if a college student does not want to study abroad, they can still go abroad for less money. Many companies likeWorkawayoffer food and other accommodations for travelers who can work about five hours a day. Using Workaway is a great way to make new friends, memories and save money. There are over 50,000 hosts who are gracious enough to let people stay in exchange for work in over 170 different countries. Traveling while in college is more manageable than traveling after because many students have summers off and the money to do it. Traveling during spring break is a good way to test the waters of traveling because it is only a week-long and can help people realize what they want to see during long trips in the summer. Traveling while in college is an amazing experience because of the memories they can make, and it can be cheaper than traveling later in life. It is a great way to experience different lifestyles, be less stressed and make yourself happier. There are many ways that college-aged people can travel, like studying abroad and working in exchange for shelter and food.

She serves as the Program Coordinator for “Meeting the Moment,” run by the Office for Religious and Spiritual Life, the Stanford Storytelling Project, LifeWorks Program for Integrative Learning, Health and Human Performance and Wellness Education. Content warning: this article contains references to suicide.If you or someone you know is in need of support, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.Additional resources are availablehere. I was heartbroken by the news of another Stanford student’s passing by suicide. Over the past seven years, I have engaged with student mental health from several angles: first as a student, then as a student staff member and now as a staff member. I want to share what I have observed about mental health on campus in a two-part article to encourage the University to better support students going forward. In Part One, I give my perspective on the mental health distress students are facing and reevaluate the modern university’s responsibility to its students. In Part Two, I offer some concrete changes that Stanford can make to address its students’ mental health needs. During my time at Stanford, I have used Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS myself, called CAPS on behalf of friends in crisis, served as a Resident Assistant (RA in an all-freshman dorm and now help teach wellness courses. I can only speak to my own experiences and not those of all Stanford students. If other members of the Stanford community have noticed important facets of this issue that have not been represented, I encourage you to speak out or to write about what you are seeing. Change that addresses the true root and scope of this issue needs to be guided by a diversity of perspectives. Last month, President Biden announced his strategies to address our“national mental health crisis.”He particularly emphasized the alarming data concerning young people’s mental health. This distress has only been compounded by the pandemic. Stanford’s recentstudent mental health surveyis an appropriate first step for assessing student needs, but it is not a reason to delay immediate, concrete action. There are clear steps that the University can take now to address the stark mental health needs of its student body. For one, student mental health services struggle to receive adequate funding and are unable to meet student demand, which is further addressed in Part Two. After witnessing widespread student distress as an RA, I asked senior Stanford staff members why more money was not going towards supporting student mental health. I was told that Stanford, like many universities, has historically seen the mental health issues affecting students as a product of larger societal forces or as individual problems, and thus somewhat outside the University’s scope and responsibility. Recent events and trends require us to revisit the question with a greater sense of urgency: given the state of youth mental health, what is a modern university’s responsibility to its students’ well-being and, at this point, safety? And the natural follow-up: is the University fulfilling this responsibility? The line of responsibility can be blurry. There is no standardized approach, and the climate surrounding mental health needs and care is changing rapidly. I acknowledge that it is not possible for universities to mitigate all forms of pressure that students face today. But some pressures that affect student mental health fall firmly within a university’s scope. For example, universities are uniquely responsible for the pressures of a campus culture they create and the effects of those pressures on student mental health. An important contributing factor to the state of student mental health at Stanford is distinctly within the University’s scope: high-achieving culture. Stanford perpetuates high-achieving culture as an elite school that admits only the very top high-achievers. This comes with a responsibility to equip its students with resources to manage the less-publicized, darker sides of high achieving. College admissions, and specifically admissions at Stanford, have become markedly more competitive over the past few decades. This is not simply a case of more applications – the caliber of applicants has skyrocketed too. Students face intense pressure to excel across multiple disciplines to even have a chance at being accepted into a school like Stanford. As one of the most selective universities in the country, Stanford has become agleaming symbolof high-achieving culture. It exemplifies the grueling grind that pushes kids to extraordinary limits and then selects for the very top of the applicant pool, the students who drove themselves the hardest within this system. The highest of high-achievers. Hyper-achievers. Currently, Stanford only addresses the upside of high-achieving. Stanford highlights its high achievers’ successes readily, fortifying its brand as an elite institution with groundbreaking innovators and leaders. All brands do this. That is the easy part. What is harder, but perhaps more important, is to formally acknowledge and address the darker side of high-achieving. After all, the same factors that fuel high-achieving, such as perfectionism, make students more vulnerable to mental health issues, as they entail having unrealistically high expectations for themselves and being hypercritical of themselves when they do not meet these expectations. The causality can go both ways; high-achieving behaviors are also common coping mechanisms for underlying mental health issues such as anxiety. In the Journal of Clinical Psychology, Limburg et al.’s 2016meta-analysisof 284 studies found that high perfectionism correlated with depression, anxiety, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, self-harm and suicidal ideation. In a 2020studyfrom the journal American Psychologist, Luthar et al. showed that at high-achieving high schools, teenagers’ rates of clinical depression and anxiety symptoms were three to seven times higher than national norms for their peers. Excellence does not happen without enormous amounts of pressure. What we see highlighted in Stanford’s social media profiles on students is the shiny end product of achievement. We see only the “perfect diamond” at the end of the process. Not the many years of high pressure that created it, nor the lasting effects of that pressure on a young person’s psyche. These issues start long before students reach Stanford and go deep, all the way down to students’ senses of identity and worth. These core beliefs began forming based on what they were given love and validation for as children and have been reinforced ever since. Stanford’s hyper-achieving students have been so conditioned to conflate their self-worth and value with achievement and “being the best” that it makes them particularly dependent on external validation and vulnerable to intense psychological distress when they fall short of perfection. Often lurking beneath high-achieving is the belief: “In order to be lovable or worthy, I need to be perfect/achieve.” I chose to stay at Stanford after graduating to work in student wellness, in large part due to the emotional distress I saw among my friends and residents as an undergraduate. While working as an RA, I would often see students who were “high-functioning,” in the sense that they could maintain good grades and were skilled at hiding that they were not doing well emotionally. But when they entered my room and sat down on the couch, the masks would drop. I learned that being “high-functioning” can conceal high distress, especially given that for high-achievers, getting good grades and performing well is a coping mechanism in itself. (If you’re not doing well, just study harder. Be busier. I witnessed multiple residents who were suicidal for most of the year, and one never would have known from the outside. What especially disturbed me about this high level of distress was that it was largely invisible. It remained for the most part between RAs and students, sometimes RFs. RAs and RFs knew anecdotally that severe mental distress was a problem, but there was a lack of aggregate, publicly accessible data about it. So there was a disconnect between the reality of high-frequency/high-severity mental health crises and formal data reporting its existence to the administration and larger Stanford community. Because so much of this information remains siloed in individual dormitories, most people on campus cannot see the magnitude of distress that is happening, so they are unable to hold the University accountable for making changes to address it. One formal measure that can reflect a subset of this distress is the data on 5150 holds (5150 is a section number from the California Welfare and Institutions Code . A 5150 is issued when someone is experiencing a mental health crisis severe enough that they are evaluated to be an imminent danger to themselves or others, “or gravely disabled.” They are then placed on a 72-hour hold by a clinician or a deputy and transported to a hospital. Most often this call is made when someone is experiencing acute suicidality, not just experiencing suicidal ideation. Stanford’s Department of Public Safety provided the official numbers on 5150 holds from 2016-2021. These numbers are not publicized. Furthermore, they only represent cases in which someone received formal institutional help. These numbers do not account for the much larger number of students who were experiencing the same levels of distress but were supported privately by friends and student staff, or the number of students who kept their distress to themselves. They do not capture voluntary hospitalizations, where students checked themselves into the hospital, or cases in which a student was off-campus when a 5150 was issued. SUDPS did not respond to requests for data going back decades to track these numbers over time. Part Two of this article addresses concrete steps that the University can take to better support its students’ mental health. The cultural narrative around young people’s mental health is shifting rapidly. I invite Stanford to take this opportunity to become a university leader in prioritizing student mental healthcare.

crimson_2022_53,"I never knew that I was ugly. Or, at least, that white society thought so. Growing up, I had never felt more invisible. My middle school years were defined by excessive in-school suspensions and meetings in the principal’s office. I was a straight A student in a public charter school, but that was impossible to see when my behavior was always defined for me. I was not a troublesome student. In fact, I enjoyed following the rules. So, why couldn’t the school administrators see that? Why was I punished significantly more than other students for the same behavior? During my first suspension in middle school, I did not have the vocabulary to defend myself. I remember sitting at the principal’s round table, hands crossed in my lap. Her office, lacking personal touches and color, mirrored an interrogation room. The door to her office was only slightly ajar, but I could hear everything. It was as if my teachers couldn’t be bothered to hide their opinions of me. “She’s a distraction during study period.” “She cannot keep speaking out of turn.” I was hypervisible – an unfortunate symptom of my ugliness. I was always being watched. So, I sat there alone, awaiting a punishment that I knew would be too strict. What I did not realize was that the coming-of-age process for Black girls had an extra miserable layer: we were ugly, whether we believed it or not. Tarana Burke describes this phenomenon in a work I was introduced to during my first semester of sophomore year. Being ugly, she said, is the “funny way that some people interact with those they deem physically unattractive … I know this because I’m ugly. At least that’s what the world finds new ways to tell me every day.” For Burke, the ugliness the world attached to her was physical. For me, ugliness spoke to being unimportant, unseen, and unheard as a child. Black women have been called ugly for longer than we’ve been deemed human. Black girls live in a paradoxical state where they’re too ugly to be loved, yet too sexualized to be cherished. America knows all too well the consequences of labeling Black girls as promiscuous; there is no forgiveness or innocence awarded to Black girls who simply want to be children. Black girls experience sexual assault at a higher rate than their counterparts. In fact, one in four Black girls will be sexually abused before the age of 18. When I was 12, being ugly meant people did not care to understand me or hear me. Nobody believed that I could be a rule-abiding student, even though I valued my education. As Black girls, we didn’t have the luxury of making mistakes. Now, as an almost 20 year-old woman studying at Harvard, I’m still proving myself. I find romantic relationships difficult to navigate because I am hypersexualized. The ugliness that was once attached to my body has morphed into lust. Black women exist in a space between femininity and masculinity that denies us access to either. For Black women, “ugly” means something deeper. It means that we aren’t seen as fully human and, therefore, we do not fit into the Eurocentric construct of gender. It also means that other people define us before we get to define ourselves. White society never misses a chance to remind Black women that they’re the most disrespected group in America. I refuse to continue the cycle of perpetuated violence against other women who look like me, so I’m done listening. To be a Black girl in America is to trust that you’re beautiful when the world covers the mirrors. Black girls, I see you. And, more importantly, I am not afraid to look at you. Ebony M.

crimson_2022_156,"I imagine that hearing of thedeath of Queen Elizabeth IImust have been a paralyzing moment for citizens of the United Kingdom, a collective experience so totalizing that theKingdom’s ten days of mourningjust might not suffice to properly memorialize her tremendously long rule. After all, the world she departed has aged quite a bit since sheassumed her reign in 1952, exactly 70 years ago. But for me, the Queen’s death — her ability to now peacefully populate the pages of history — solemnly reminds me that time can be too kind to institutions of power and their agents; that for the Queen to now inhabit the past is a privilege which her colonial subjects, tortured well into the present by the consequences of British imperialism, will never hold. In particular, it is a luxury the people of Kashmir — my people, forever shackled to her memory — will never hold. And while the Queen likely forgot Kashmir by the end of her life, the people of Kashmir will not be spared from remembering her name and the suffering she sowed in their land. Although thePartition of India, Pakistan, and Kashmirin 1947 — a treacherous bloodbath architected by the British that claimed the lives of approximately one million people — predated the Queen’s rule, the Indian subcontinent was still well-inscribed within Britain’s colonial playbook. Indeed, the nations born of Partition hardly belonged to themselves. India and Pakistan did not triumph post-1947 as paradises of independence; rather, the footprints of the British who had so callouslymappedborders and bodies in the Indian subcontinent against each other based largely on religious demographics were not only visible, but also alive. Manufactured by Partition were not new nation-states, but still-breathing artifacts of British coloniality. What had been performed as a profound gesture of decolonization on the international stage had instead only reproduced the horrors of British imperialism. Kashmir, in particular, became the connective tissue that Britain leveraged to maintain and tighten its colonial gaze in the Indian subcontinent — and, most remarkably, it became the biggest loser in this imperial exchange. It was Queen Elizabeth’s Britain that had consolidated tensions between India and Pakistan byinflaming and prolonging both states’colonial dreams of acquiring Kashmir, all with no intention to formally intervene in fears of losing economic support in the region. Indeed, to the British, Kashmir was not a people to protect or a land to be liberated — it was a political balancing act, lives cruelly contorted into the grooves of its colonial imagination. It was Queen Elizabeth’s Britain that trivialized the self-determination of the Kashmiri people, deftly dangling above their heads the fantasy of conducting aplebiscitein Kashmir that woulddeterminewhether the region would join India or Pakistan or become its own internationally-recognized state. To this day, almost a century after Britain’s 1948 United Nations Security Council vote in its favor, such a plebiscitehas never been held. And it was Queen Elizabeth who considered her political interest in the Indian subcontinent one of“noninterference,”which, frankly, makes me chuckle — because what is more invasive and political than colonialism? But despite the violence she engineered in my homeland, I do not wish Queen Elizabeth pain in death. I only wish to puncture this protective veil we seem to cast on figures of history, who, upon their death, are allowed to luxuriate in the past, untouched and beautified. In Kashmir, there is no such thing as the past. Genealogies of occupation in the Kashmir Valley can be traced to the late-sixteenth century, when Sultan Yousuf Shah Chak — the final indigenous ruler of Kashmir — was deposed by the Mughal emperor through a trick of deception now all too familiar to the Kashmiri eye: settler-colonialism, disguised as a call for peaceful negotiations. Colonization in Kashmir is uniquely embodied. From the toppling of the Shah dynasty to the Valley’s infamous reputation as themost militarized regiontoday, settler-colonialism has crystallized in the bodies of every Kashmiri. For us, one occupier is no different than the other, no history more past than the other. Life in Kashmir bends time and space — and to breathe in Kashmir is not to inhale, but to gasp for air, for relief. I resent the Queen because, when Kashmiri people die, there is no space in the past for them. When Kashmiri people die, they just disappear — no ten days of mourning, but just ten more days, months, years, and centuries of the same, endless nightmare of occupation. But these histories are not forgotten; they are erased. Harvard, in particular, knows well the violence inflicted by its owneffaced colonial histories, as well as the promise ofdecolonial knowledge production— knowledge committed to deconstructing our sanitized public memory and honoring the silenced victims of colonialism. Harvard must expand its probing into colonial encounters, though, beyond its gates. From Harvard to Kashmir and beyond, it is through this kind of counter-hegemonic engagement with institutions of power that we may learn, for once, to empower communities like the Kashmiri people. And it is through this radical attempt at unlearning that we may no longer worship a woman who, before she became a queen, bled the color of a colonizer. Sameer M.

stanforddaily_2022_108,"— Misha Lee is a high school senior from Irvine, California. She is a regular listener of KZSU. For as long as I can remember, I’ve awoken on Sunday mornings to the smell of hot bacon and the wild chatter of male broadcasters giving football commentary. Announcing for sports games, whether narrating live plays from a match or giving feedback following the conclusion of the final quarter, has always been a dream of mine, stemming from the positive impact athletics has had on my life. However, as a woman interested in a male-dominated career, the statistics depicting the deficit in female involvement in sports entertainment are far from encouraging. I am disappointed to say that KZSU 90.1, Stanford’s student-led FM radio broadcast, is not exempt from this gender disparity. Stanford athletics is represented by several announcers at KZSU, consisting of students from a wide variety of majors and graduating classes. Out of the 13 individuals who are regularly involved with the sports section of Stanford’s student-run radio station, only one announcer is female, and she will soon graduate in the Class of 2022. KZSU’s 12 to one male to female ratio is not far from the national average in the media. Only 10% of sports editors and 11.5% of sports reporters in the United States and Canada identify as female, as cited by Paola Boivin in aGlobal Sports Matters feature published in March of last year. The large gender gap between female and male reporters has been found to have a strong correlation with what content is being covered in the media.In an article published in May 2019 by Joseph Abisaid and Bo Li, a correlation is drawn between the lack of female presence in sports newsrooms and the disparities in the amount of coverage female sports receive. Significantly higher numbers of male reporters appear to be directly related to the significantly higher coverage of male athletics, and the converse applies to female sports.A study from the University of Southern California and Purdue Universityfound that coverage of men’s sports totaled around 95% of television coverage and the ESPN highlights show SportsCenter in 2019. In most cases where a women’s sport was highlighted, it was almost always overshadowed by the “Big Three” of men’s sports (basketball, football and baseball , with coverage that was often more frequent and more extensive. The victories of female athletes have historically been cast aside to highlight the achievements of their male counterparts, and without broadcasters fighting for more coverage on female athletics, the imbalance in sports coverage between genders will continue to persist. The disparity in female broadcasters controls the content being reported on, and this lack of representation of women in sports media reinforces the stereotype that sports is a male-dominated activity, hindering all female athletes. It is incredibly discouraging for female athletes, regardless of what sport they play, to see their progress discounted in favor of highlighting achievements of the opposite gender. Oftentimes, younger individuals find difficulty in taking initiative to pursue their own passions without an example to follow. Popular success stories routinely encourage and inspire children to set goals that far exceed what may be easily attainable. Both the lack of female success in sports broadcasting as well as the undercoverage of female athletics in the media has discouraged young women from pursuing professions in this field, and without a change in the ideas being established in younger minds, this mindset will continue into future generations. The percentage of female announcers increases yearly, foreshadowing a future where women will be represented in higher quantities by the media. However, without a shift in equal representation, both inwhois headlining andwhatis being headlined, no progress will be made towards a future that fulfills promises of equality. By no means does an increase in participation of females in athletic broadcasting sacrifice the positions previously allotted to men, nor does this have to divide sports coverage solely based on gender. Having individuals from different backgrounds comment on the same topics will provide listeners with diverse, fresh perspectives, and introduce a new depth to sports broadcasting. On a national level, the sports industry is slowly progressing towards a future of equal representation. More and more all-female broadcast teams are emerging, the most recent being Leah Hextall, Cassie Campbell-Pascall and Linda Cohn, who made history on January 17, 2022, narrating the Arizona Coyotes and Montreal Canadiens game at Gila River Arena asESPN’s first all-female NHL broadcast team. Teams like these set precedents for future generations, providing aspiring female announcers with examples of women who were once in the same position they were, building themselves up to success through perseverance and dedication. At Stanford, I think it is up to current students to provide incoming classes with a foundation for success. Beginning with New Student Orientation, freshmen and transfer students can be introduced to KZSU, which as an organization can focus on the deliberate recruitment of female talent. KZSU must work twice as hard to attract female students to overcompensate for the deficit that already exists in the candidate pool. The KZSU Quarterly Info Meetings are also incredibly important, as they should not only be used to give more insight into the station’s inner workings, but also to make an explicit call for female candidates to join and have their voices heard. Having past and current female KZSU broadcasters speak at these meetings would be beneficial, as female candidates can then hear about the positive experiences women have had while working in sports broadcasting at KZSU. KZSU should also build broadcast teams composed of both female and male reporters, so broadcasters of both genders can collaborate to create a unique and nuanced commentary style. Broadcasters should be encouraged to explore narration for both female and male sports to eliminate the idea that gender categorizes our interests. Lastly, KZSU must create an inclusive environment, as having a diverse team does not guarantee that female broadcasters feel welcome and heard. In the coming years, institutions need to encourage an increase in female representation in sports broadcasting, which will then improve the coverage of the accomplishments within female athletics. I believe that can begin at Stanford, starting with KZSU, eventually pushing other collegiate and national institutions to follow suit.

state_press_2022_23,"The garage of the Thunderbird Golf Complex at Papago Golf Club in Phoenix on Monday, March 18, 2019. For a long time now — seven years, to be exact — ASU has been known as the innovation school. We’ve all seen the signs around campus and plastered on buses that ASU is“No. 1 in innovation,”but when it comes to athletics, one program leads the way in innovation: golf. ASU golf moved into a new practice facility in 2018 at Papago Golf Club, calledThunderbirds Golf Complex, which was designed by PGA Tour professional and ASU alumnus Phil Mickelson. The facility is full of state-of-the-art labs and practice areas to help the Sun Devils improve their golf game. “The practice facility has a lot of unique traits, said graduate student ASU golfer Mason Andersen. Everything is kind of designed to be difficult.” Over-preparing is a great strategy, especially when it comes to the game of golf, because you never know what shot is going to come next. In golf, you never truly know where the ball is going to land. You could hit an absolutely gorgeous shot, but the wind might carry the ball an extra 20 yards and end up wedgedunderneath a cactus. Unfortunately, ASU doesn’t have a practice area to hit a shot from underneath a cactus, but Andersen commended the practice facility for its uniqueness. “There are some cool designs, like our putting greens are percentage-based, so we have one slope that’s 1%, another slope that’s 2%, etc … You’ve got a lot of options, and that’s what I think was the goal, to leave no stone unturned,” Andersen said. What is truly innovative about the design of the practice facility is that it trains golfers to do anything they might need to in a round of golf, from short game to approaching shots. Another aspect of innovation is new technology. According to Andersen, the Thunderbird Complex is equipped with “a really cool golf lab” that has a putting platform that tilts to give the golfer different angles for their putts, a putting lab that tells the golfer how good their putting stroke is, and a balance lab that measures where the golfer’s weight is displaced while they take a swing. All of this technology has helped theASU men’sandwomen’s golfteams remain near the top of the NCAA rankings in the sport. As of right now, the men are ranked No. 2 in the nation, and the women are ranked No. 13. But at the end of the day, a lot of what makes ASU golf so consistent is repetition. Being able to go into the practice facility and choose what kind of shot you want to work on is paramount in making a good golfer. Repeating the same motion over and over again until that motion is ingrained in your head and makes you better. Innovation makes things better, and it has surely set the ASU golf team up for success.

ubyssey_2022_40,"Jan. 30, 2022 Written byIman Janmohamed Dear Iman, How can I stay on top of things with online school? I hate it here. Even if online school will be over soon, there’s one word that summarizes the university experience right now: “isolating.” I hate online school as much as the next person, and though I know that it’s an important measure to keep everyone safe, it still sucks. Big time. Falling into the habit of waking up five minutes before your class, scrolling through TikTok with your Zoom camera off and only unmuting to say “we can hear you, professor” is easy. Hell, I’ve caught myself doing it and it’s only been a week or so. The only way I can stay on top of life when the world seems to be crashing and burning is to make a routine. Keeping a routine that’s similar to your typical school routine is important, not only to feel productive but also to feel as comfortable and close to (your version of normal as possible. I feel like hot garbage when I fall out of routine and all the tasks I need done don’t get done. Remember the laundry you didn’t do on Tuesday? You now have a few loads piled up. What about that assignment due last week? Oops. Oops indeed! Keeping a routine is important — whether that’s with laundry, assignments, grocery shopping or waking up and going to bed — so you don’t feel like it’s all going to shit. I like to block out my routine in my calendar. Having specific times to complete tasks helps me finish what I need to without stressing about where I’ll find the time to do it, because I’ve already booked the time with myself. Putting up reminders either on your phone or on sticky-notes around your space can also help you stick to a routine. Routine is hard, but doing your best to stay committed to one can keep you focused, even if it’s flexible and malleable and not super rigid. Interacting with others is a big part of my routine that’s been taken away by classes being moved online. And honestly, it’s not something that I can go a day without. To resolve this, I’ve taken to regularly reaching out to the friends and family I can’t see and going on safe walks with my bubble between classes. Creating a community with my classmates is also super nice, though hard, while online. Online peer interactions through social media or Discord (gamers rejoice can do this. Make friends! It’s worth it, I promise. Your routine may change throughout the few weeks we’re online, but having a routine, no matter how it looks, can make you feel more in control and help you stay in school (and self-care mode. Making small adaptations to our normal routines to suit online classes can keep us feeling grounded when everything around us makes us feel scared. Uncertainty is everywhere and it’s completely normal to feel anxious. Taking steps to keep yourself and the people around you safe — likegetting your booster shotif you’re eligible, masking up and limiting contact with large groups of people — it all helps, even if it may not feel like it does.

wildcat_arizona_2022_66,"Large heart-shaped balloons float outside of the Forbes building on the University of Arizona campus on Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2018. As college students, it can be really hard to put yourself first. There are so many things on your plate, that your own mental or physical wellness may no longer become a priority. Especially with the pressure of everyone around you, it almost feels selfish to want to take time for yourself. This is something we, as young adults, need to get over. Self-love is not selfish. It is more important than ever to take time for yourself in college because you are surrounded by so many other people and are constantly moving at full speed every day. There are an endless number of priorities in college that you must manage, but if you don’t slow down once in a while and do things for yourself, you’re going to crash and burn. “Mental health affects every aspect of your life,” said Hector Reyes, a mental health clinician and counselor at the Guerrero Student Center. “Everything that you try to do, you are bringing yourself to that task. If our tank is empty and we are just spent, then it is going to be really hard to show up for all of those different things.” This is why you have to put your own wellness before others because how you are feeling on the inside has a direct connection to how you act towards people on the outside. It can be challenging to realize that you are giving more to the people around you than you are giving to yourself. But once you are able to create that balance in your life, I don’t think you will ever want to go back. Marissa Farhi, a sophomore majoring in communications, and Wellness Chair of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority said that in past friendships she has definitely found herself giving more than the other person. “If a friend calls me and tells me about their life for 15 minutes and doesn’t ask me a single question about my life, it gets to a point where it it’s like this is exhausting. The energy has to be reciprocated,” Farhi said. This is something that I am guilty of in my own life as well. I had to realize that if I am constantly expelling my problems on to someone else, not only does it put a bigger burden on them, but it also shows me I might need better ways to cope with things on my own. Even though it is still so important to have people in your life who care about you and want to support you, everyone is dealing with their own problems. Sometimes it can be more beneficial to try and work through things with your own inner self. Farhi explained what does on a daily basis to help her check in with her emotions and reset her mental health. “Affirmations and journaling literally rewired my subconscious brain. Starting my day with a grateful heart has really helped me with self-love,” Fahri said. She added that fueling your body with foods that make you feel good and incorporating movement into every day is important as well. It may seem hard at first to create new habits in your life, but the key to bettering yourself is taking small steps in the right direction. You don’t have to incorporate all of these lifestyle changes at once, but by easing into things slowly, it will soon become second nature. Reyes said the best advice he can give to a college student wanting to start their self-love journey is to know that it takes time to figure it out. “Be open to different experiences, note what works and what doesn’t work, and see how the effects help you over time,” Reyes said. Once students are able to realize that it is normal to want to put yourself first and that it’s not going to label them as “selfish,” it becomes so much easier to love who you are and who you are becoming. There is nothing wrong with wanting to stay in and give your body the quality time it needs to recharge and reset. I am a strong believer that trying out things like journaling, meditation and acts of gratitude will bring a lot more light into your life and your mind.

stanforddaily_2022_73,"Alberto Mora is a current graduate student in the Latin American Studies program. As someone who was born and raised in the Bay Area, coming to Stanford University as a student can almost feel like an entirely different world. The campus itself perpetuates the illusion that the Bay Area is a socially progressive utopia. The harsh reality, however, is that the Bay Area is massively unequal and highly stratified. For example, I was born and raised in Redwood City, a mid-sized suburban city that is about 10 minutes away from campus; however, despite my familiarity with and proximity to Palo Alto, I felt like a stranger when I first came here. Given Stanford’s worldwide reputation as a premier university, as well as its deep connections to Silicon Valley, it is easy to understand why it is such an attractive choice for many students. Nevertheless, in six months at Stanford, only five of the countless undergraduate and graduate students I met were originally from the Bay Area. According to Stanford’s undergraduate student profile for Fall 2021, of the 7,645 matriculated undergraduate students, only 36% were from California, while international and out-of-state students accounted for 64% of the studentpopulation. Furthermore, the statistics do not reveal what fraction of the 36% of students from California is actually from the Bay Area. While I am not critiquing the type of student that comes to Stanford, it is important to let Stanford students know that life at the university is not representative of what many people experience in the Bay. Perhaps many students know how the San Francisco Bay Area is infamous for its severe housing crisis, yet I doubt that many actually understand what that entails. Being the son of Mexican immigrants, I grew up in a small unincorporated section of Redwood City known as North Fair Oaks, or as it’s known colloquially, “Little Mexico.” Due to its large Mexican/Latinx population, North Fair Oaks has been a historically low-income community that for the most part has been segregated from the rest of Redwood City. It was here that my parents were able to afford a home; that is, until the 2008-2009 subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent recession. Since then, my family and I have moved from apartment to apartment trying to support ourselves during one of the most financially challenging times in U.S. history. By the time I graduated high school back in 2014, and with the economy beginning to recuperate, we were unable to compete with the rising housing costs due to the influx of tech workers in the Silicon Valley; we had no other choice but to move to the East Bay. Even to this day, the ripple effect of the housing crisis and gentrification is pushing my family out, making it more difficult to continue living in the Bay Area. Adding insult to injury, the last information I heard about my childhood home that was foreclosed on us back in 2010 was that it sold for $1.3 million dollars a few years later. Contrasting this to the present day, many students who find out I’m from here often ask about the best hang-out spots in San Francisco or San Jose, or the best places to eat, or where the best beaches or hiking trails are located. As someone who has had to climb an overwhelmingly large mountain to get here, a place that has been figuratively in my backyard yet drastically out of my reach, I can’t help but feel a twinge of pain and frustration. To feel like a stranger or tourist in one’s own home and neighborhood gives the impression that my life experiences and overall existence here are invalidated or unwanted amid the changing demographics of the Bay Area. This is not to say that students here are overtly oblivious to the greater socio-economic disparity around the Bay Area; rather, Stanford seems to almost enclose students in an environment where most basic necessities and other services like healthcare, childcare, sports and other amenities are taken care of one way or another. Many students spend their time here without ever exploring the “real” Bay Area. My goal in raising awareness of this issue is not to blame Stanford or guilt Stanford students, but I believe that everyone here on campus should take the time to investigate this divide between Stanford and the rest of the Bay. To the University’s credit, Stanford seems to be taking steps to bridge this gap by offering community engagement programs likeCardinal Coursesthat “engage in projects and partnerships in the community that address social or environmental challenges,” or by providing internship opportunities to local middle school andhigh school students. Nevertheless, I would suggest that Stanford students who truly want to get an “authentic” Bay Area experience should physically explore areas that aren’t often advertised around campus. A simple BART ride through Oakland, traveling through East Palo Alto, or walking through the Alum Rock area of San Jose can be an eye-opening experience. It’ll give you a more real sense of what the Bay Area is like rather than exploring the Googleplex, ApplePark or Facebook’s headquarters. So when students on campus are often basking in the warm California weather, or lounging about at the Coupa Café, lamenting about the exorbitant prices at the local grocery stores on campus or around Palo Alto, or hiking through the Santa Cruz mountains, please note that there are tangible, social inequities that prevent people in the Bay Area from having the same access and privilege afforded to students here at Stanford. As more and more low-income and a disproportionately large number of primarily minority families in and around the Bay are being pushed out of their homes, remember that Stanford does not represent what true life is like in the Bay Area.

crimson_2022_58,"“What would you like to experience for the first time again?” “What’s the greatest gift you’ve ever given someone else?” “Would you rather live in a house made of chocolate, or a house made of cheese?” Many such icebreakers reside in my rather poorly organized Google Drive, hidden within a document titled “36 questions to induce a (hopefully good convo by chels.” When I first read the viralNew York Times articleon 36 questions that could supposedly lead to love between complete strangers, it materialized something I’d felt I needed for many years of my life: some sort of formulaic, step-by-step process to intimacy and better connections. Over winter break freshman year, I wrote my own list of 36, aiming for lower stakes but higher quality conversations. “Don’t do all 36 at once,” I’d emphasize, every time I gently forced other people to do this with me. “Just pick a few, or each person can pick one, and see where it goes from there.” Since then, my unofficial role in student organizations has been the icebreaker generator. I believe that the way people answer these questions — even the sillier ones! — reveals so much about them. But more significantly, I have this inexplicably intense faith that this habitual sharing and discussing is crucial to forming strong connections, whether romantic or platonic. It’s embarrassingly on-brand for a Harvard student to have this approach to love. Like somehow, if I could have X number of conversations discussing Y number of “deep questions” over Z number of weeks, I’d be able to plan and develop the connections I wanted. As if somehow, relationships could be worked on like a project or extracurricular activity. In 2020, nudged into a gap year because of the pandemic, I joinedDatamatchas part of their business team. I committed myself to selling this idea that an algorithm — yes, even an algorithm based on answers about Harry Styles fanfiction and the Adams fly situation — could predict love and friendship. In the past few weeks, I’ve pitched Datamatch, formally and informally, to friends, strangers, restaurants, and sponsors. While attributing thousands of online matches to the Algorithm™ is Datamatch’s snappy, memorable brand, the real magic that leads to the adorable success stories we present on our Instagram is even simpler. No matter the percentage of compatibility assigned, the real success of those stories is the fact that all of them reached out. Every single one of them deliberately chose to click “match,” chose to meet up in-person, chose to go on a second date. I’m sure most people know that an algorithm can only help you to a certain extent, whether it’s on Datamatch, Tinder, or Christian Mingle. But despite this knowledge, people often don’t make this deliberate series of choices towards something beautiful. Instead, we worry over whether that beautiful relationship at the end is even achievable, even worth pursuing. It’s also embarrassingly on-brand for us at Harvard to feel like the worst thing we could ever do is waste someone else’s time. Obviously, because we don’t have the free time for things that won’t work out, we label so, so many things as a waste of time — preemptively rejecting possibilities to protect ourselves from disappointment. I’ve definitely apologized for taking up someone’s p-setting hours to continue a good dinner conversation, and I’ve definitely also been hurt (perhaps unfairly by friends choosing to prioritize their assignments over me. But even if those idealized relationships aren’t achievable, it’s always worth trying. It’s worth it that we care, and that we stand by our decisions to care. How could that be a waste of time? During the tragic and isolating moments of the pandemic, the one benefit I thrived on was how people were forced to be more explicit about making space for human connection. People I rarely expected to initiate conversations on campus were so much more willing to catch up, and I truly appreciated the collective sense of desperation — and I mean that in the most loving way possible. These initiations began deliberate sets of choices, and I’ve never regretted making that first step, regardless of the outcome. Still, these steps have to be taken from a place of deep love. No amount of creative icebreaking or statistical analyses can truly ease loneliness if it is not built on genuine care and affection from all parties. With the lessons learned from our time away, I hope that we will deliberately choose to be unequivocal when we love each other, when we miss each other, when we really would rather not do that seminar reading — because it’s worth making time for each other. I hope that we will love each other wholeheartedly, far beyond the systems we’ve designed to aid us in our pursuits. Is this idealistic and too much to ask from a campus that’s currently going on one-off dates mainly from the promise of free food and the (more vague promise of scientific accuracy? Maybe. But at least for me, I’ll be working on this — long after Valentine’s Day, and long after our website closes. Chelsea E.

state_press_2022_28,"Wellness means taking the time to get to know ourselves and creating our path to health and healing. Looking after our mental and physical well-being is essential, but as students, it s hard to balance our hobbies, a sleep schedule and class workload. Although ASU has prioritized mental health and wellness for its students, students stillstruggleto balance wellness in their daily lives. While ASU works to provide resources for students, the choice to create good wellness practices is ultimately up to the students themselves. According to a 2019 survey of over 2,000 ASU students, nearly 50% of students had felt so depressed it was difficult to function in the last 12 months, and around 15% seriously considered attempting suicide. ASU s wellness website shares a lot of resources of what ASU is doing for the students, from podcasts to guides topassing the semester. But what students fail to remember is that it s OK to take time of your day to disconnect, whether that means working out, watching a TV show, or preparing a healthy snack. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, wellness is defined as the quality or state of being in good health especially as an actively sought goal. Unfortunately, many of us focus too much on this definition, especially regarding actively pursuing a goal — we want to achieve wellness without remembering what it s all about. Wellness isn t going to the gym and eating the healthiest diet every single day. Instead, wellness means taking the time to get to know ourselves and creating our path to health and healing. It s important to remember that there s no one-size-fits-all definition of wellness. Instead, we tailor wellness to accommodate our tastes and hobbies. Wellness has experienced a media boom and seems to be at the center of news outlets, but some have complained that our obsession with wellness has led us to developtoxiclifestyles. Focusing so much on wellness that we set unrealistic goals and expectations for ourselves and feel extremely disheartened when we don t achieve them. This is fueled by social media as we keep seeing pictures of the perfect bodies and the perfect life. Wellness is more than a multi-million industry and should be focused solely on enjoying the journey and path we are on, instead of beating ourselves up to find an unachievable ideal image. We can do this by taking a 30-minute walk every day. There are manybenefitsto walking. It improves health, lowers blood pressure, helps with our cardiac health, and for those of us that have been stuck in a funk the past two weeks, it can help with mood swings and depression. Jonie Pretto, a senior studying criminology and criminal justice who also teaches yoga at the Sun Devil Fitness Complex on the Downtown Phoenix campus, was inspired by yoga steachingsand tries to incorporate mantras and healthy tips for her students. I have this job as a group fitness instructor. But I also like to think of it mentally and incorporate stress management skills and tips on taking care of yourself, she said. As students, it s difficult for us to focus on our well-being when we continuously believe that we come second to our workload. I m sometimes guilty of this as I struggle to find time to engage with my hobbies when I m constantly stressed about the next deadline or next test. Students have to remember to take care of themselves, hang out with friends, and enjoy hobbies. TheSDFC is a great wayto release some tension and energy, and it comes with the added benefit of being free for ASU students. ASU has many resources that can help students achieve wellness; some include ASU Counseling Services, where students can make an appointment through campus health services. The wellness department at the SDFC also helps students find resources on mindful eating, nutrition, sleeping, stress, and anygroup fitness classesstudents might be interested in taking. We mustn t be too hard on ourselves when it comes to wellness. In the end, we are all human, we re all gonna have our ups and downs, we re all gonna have good and bad days, Pretto said. We should enjoy our journey, enjoy making that snack, going out on that walk and working out. Wellness is about achieving a healthy and balanced lifestyle.

wildcat_arizona_2022_31,"A protester holds a sign at the Decriminalize Black Bodies march and protest on Friday, Oct. 14, at the University of Arizona. The protest was run by the Coalition of Black Students and Allies. “I am the people. My struggle is yours, your struggle will always be mine. They will never not intersect,” Kai Leigh Harriott declared on Oct.14 at a campus-wide protest at the University of Arizona. The Coalition of Black Students and Allies (COBA and the African American Student Affairs (AASA organized the protest to oppose the abuse of black and marginalized students at the hands of UA administrators. Harriott, a Black, queer and disabled student, said she experienced the first-hand effects of this abuse by several administrators at the UA, but most notably by the Interim Associate Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion, Maribel Alvarez. Alvarez’s own title signifies that she is presumed to be someone that listens to those who are marginalized and oppressed by institutions. Yet, we have seen how people like Alvarez use their positions to enforce persecution against Black students. Beginning onAug. 31, a series of negative interactions between Harriott and Alvarez occurred that subsequently caused Harriott to attempt to file a complaint against Alvarez to the UA Office of Institutional Equity. Harriott was informed that her complaint would not be investigated. A statement written by Harriott and posted on COBA’sInstagramdisclosed that she “filed a complaint against Maribel with the Office of Institutional Equity. I found it odd that I did not receive a confirmation email from OIE confirming they received my report.” She continued that she, “never was asked to meet with an investigator or asked to submit a statement about the incident.” It was then reported that AlvarezhumiliatedHarriott and refused to meet with her and Black student leadership about their needs. On Sept. 30,Harriottattempted to confront Alvarez in her office at the MLK building on campus to express her feelings of discontent. After Harriott confronted Alvarez about the maltreatment of students — especially herself — she was greeted by three police cars outside of the MLK building. “Three police cars for one Disabled Black Queer student arrived ” and “they positioned their vehicles in front of every accessible exit, knowing full well that they were weaponizing the ableist architecture that the University is entirely made out of,” COBA organizers expressed in theirincidentreport. For years we have seen how the outrageous and unwarranted use of police — that is perpetuated by institutions of power — has been weaponized against Black and marginalized people of color. So although this is what we expect, it should not be something we accept from the UA. RELATED:OPINION: Students should not stand for white supremacy Although theUAhas released a statement regarding Alvarez and the incident with promises to, “launch a national search for a new Vice President and Chief Inclusion Officer,” add a Senior Director of Cultural and Resource Centers and make more space for the AASA in the MLK Building, this does not address the root cause of the problem. Alvarez and others that contribute to violence against minority students must be removed from their positions of power and follow set standards of accountability. The UAstatedthat “Dr. Alvarez will continue in her role as Interim Associate Vice Provost, working on campus initiatives.” It was not mentioned if any other administrators will face any consequences for the irresponsible actions committed against Harriott. The UA also claimed in this statement that it was not Alvarez who called the police on Harriott. “Importantly, it has been falsely shared that Dr. Maribel Alvarez, Interim Associate Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion, made the initial call to UAPD. She did not,” stated the UA’s president, Dr. Robert C. Robbins. However, a case summary report by the University of Arizona Police Department regarding the incident on Sep. 30 has been circulating onCOBA’sInstagram and across campus that completely contradicts Robbins’ claims. TheDaily Wildcatreached out multiple times to the Tucson Police Department to legitimize the police report but has not heard back. The case report relays that Alvarez was the one that made the initial call. “A few minutes before she called UAPD at 1518 hours, Alvarez walked into her building and she saw Kai Harriott and 2 other students,” thereportnoted. All students and administrators need to recognize that this discrimination and abuse affect all of us. The actions taken by Alvarez and the response by Robbins are not representative of our values as a student body. Asani Fowler, a student organizer with COBA and a student worker with AASA told me that if you are not listening to the experiences of Black and marginalized students on campus, you are contributing to this oppression. “If you are ignorant of the situation, then you are purposefully not trying to pay attention, you are purposefully putting yourself in a position to be ignorant. A professor was murdered last week, a Black, disabled, queer woman had the police called on her in the MLK Building. These are not isolated events,” Fowler asserted. After the police were called on Harriot, COBA released a series of demands on theirsocialmedia pages. I highly encourage everyone to read through all of thesedemands, but if there is anything that you can take from it, it’s that Alvarez and other administrators that were involved in the traumatic incident experienced by Harriot should be immediately removed or resign from their positions. Students and administrators should also be focusing on community response rather than UAPD or any other community police presence on campus. “More police and more surveillance, more threat assessment and more securitization will not make us safer. We make us safer,” claimed Gary Rhoades, a UA professor of Educational Policy Studies and Practice at the Oct. 14 protest. We cannot continue to allow our own administration, which is supposed to offer us protection, to continue with policies and practices that negatively impact students. Using the police and refusing to meet with students as a scapegoat for solving problems is pathetic and detrimental to lives in our communities. Several members of theOffice of Diversity and Inclusionstaff took the first steps recently in support of holding administrators accountable, stating in a staff letter that, “a large coalition of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI full time staff, write today in support of Coalition of Black Students and Allies’ (COBA demand for the resignation of Dr. Maribel Alvarez, Interim Associate Vice Provost and the relocation of all other ODI administration out of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Student Center (MLK .” Now other administrators must do the same. Harriott acknowledged that this isn’t just a single group or person’s problem because all of our struggles intersect. If one group is hurting, we are all hurting. So help COBA and AASA fight for Black students’ rights and ultimately our rights.

Robbins, and Maribel Alvarez to support their demands. Follow Sophia Hammer onTwitter Sophia is a sophomore majoring in family studies & human development and global studies.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_4,"The U.S. Senate unanimouslypassedlegislation to make daylight saving time the permanent standard time, beginning Nov. 2023. Although it is not one of the biggest concerns of the general public at this time, the Sunshine Protection Act represents a measure of superficial economic reform. As the act advocates for a shift to a permanent daylight savings time (DST , the country will remain an hour behind standard time. States like Alaska and Hawaii already follow this practice, in a way, since they choose not to follow DST. This practice is aremnantof war times. It allowed for citizens and manufacturers to conserve energy and money by reducing the use of electricity at the time, while giving employees time to produce more. But the need for an increased push for productivity is unnecessary at the moment as the country is not in a state of war. Especially after the clear adverse toll of physical and mental health experiences during the pandemic, it is important to re-establish what we view as “productive hours.” Instead of focusing on how time can affect sleep and waking hours, it is necessary for policymakers to reform labor practices and working conditions — especially considering the shift in public attitude towards unions today, with theirrecent victoriesand demands. Whenvague and under-explained“economic reasons” and lifestyle betterment promises are cited for changes to daily life, it is easy for policymakers to state that this change is one of the first bipartisan agreements in recent years. They conveniently choose to forget the real, sweeping changes that can make a much larger impact on productivity and prosperity. Several sleep scientists and educators hold thebeliefthat maintaining the time change allows for seasonal recuperation and gives the human body time toharmonizewith the environment. The annual one-hour change in time can aid that seasonal transition and help students and workers adjust to the seasons. But, the practices adopted by the international community also need to be noted. Several nations do not follow the wartime remnant concept of daylight saving time, and instead choose toadjusttheir workday practices and benefits — for both employees and students — in order to maximize efficiency. Multiple industrialized African and Asian nations choose not to participate in the practice, and still maintain their position in the world’s economy. European nations that do maintain the practice have other laws in place to keep the workers happy. For example,The Netherlands, which employs DST, has an average 29-hour work week and ranks for the happiest citizens in the world. This is in comparison to the averageAmerican40-hour work week, with the 16th happiest citizens’ranking. While the average “happiness” of citizens isn’t indicative of effective labor policies, it does point to the response and treatment of civilian lifestyle demands. Clearly, even though this act can be helpful in the way that it willstandardizecommunications and transport coordination, it lacks the complementing policy that can actually affect a change in resource consumption and productivity. For example,reductionsin mandated workdays and increases in social and health benefits have been proven to be effective in improving productivity and corporation-client relationships. Without providing for enforced labor reforms, this act would only change clocks, and not lifestyles impacted by the systemically forced false ideal of productivity. The necessity at the moment calls for systemic change, and not superficial change. Nandini Sharma is an Opinion Staff Writer. She can be reached atnandis2@uci.edu."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_57,"Haven’t you heard? Zines are back. Whether they’re inclassroomsoronline through social media platforms, zines have reentered the mainstream — and their cultural impact is absolutely necessary for our generation. Zines, short for “magazines,” are small, self-published works made up of collages of images and texts. Zines usually come in print form, but they have recently taken on an online presence. Zine culture began around the 1930s. They sprang to popularity in the late 1970s and into the 1980s — typically within punk rock communities. They emerged again in the 1990s with the “riot grrrl” and third-wave feminist movements. Zines have notoriously acted as methods of expression and communication for socially-outcasted or marginalized communities. Today, zines are working their way back into the mainstream with Generation Z creating their own online communities with zine origins. These communities use zines to discuss various topics ranging from social justice to poetry. Throughout history, zines have allowed niche communities to express themselves through art and writing. Communities have also utilized zines to share their complex identities and opinions, taking advantage of the small, short printed creation. Manylibrariesand locally-owned bookstores have their own collections of zines, often originating from local artists in the community. Whether this is your first time hearing of zines or if you’re already an avid fanatic, zine culture is significant in its impact on local communities, and there’s a lot our generation can learn from them. With Generation Z’s notoriety for activism, zines align with the generation’s values. Zines promote arts and the humanities, allowing communities to express themselves through a creative outlet. Zines also have roots in social justice and feminism — issues with which our generation typically associates itself. Zines provide a sense of community and belonging for teens longing to fit in online, especially given the popularity of social media among our generation. Generation Z is known for bringing back elements of the past and adapting it to our values and styles. Zines are just another way we can do that. Zines aren’t solely used in the social and political spheres. With zines sprouting up online on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, many of them focus on arts, writing, fashion, music and photography. For those in our generation who aren’t well-versed in politics or social justice, there is the possibility for creativity in your personal interests instead. There are no rules to zines; only a do-it-yourself attitude and a craving for creativity is necessary to begin. There are many ways to get involved in the zine community. Participate in zine culture by starting your own zine, either by yourself or with friends. Create an Instagram account likethese. Or design your own website to display your artistic creations. You can also check out zine collections at manybranches of the Los Angeles Public Libraryor the Anaheim Library, known as thehub of the OC zine community. These libraries often have zine-making programs, so look out for those! You can also simply support artists who create zines at locally-owned bookstores inOrange County,Los AngelesandSan Diego. Zines have held so much cultural significance throughout history, and our generation is using this creative outlet to express our own interests and values. Generation Z is revolutionizing zine culture and incorporating it into our everyday lives — will you join in? Camelia Heins is an Opinion Staff Writer. She can be reached atcheins@uci.edu."
ubyssey_2022_17,"July 18, 2022 Written byAdam Dobrer As the bright lights of the Michael Kingsmill Forum melded with a chorus of cheers from the Divestment Coalition, my heart sank. Councillors filed out of the room, celebration filtered down the stairs of the Nest and I could do little but take in the mosaic of expressions on my friends’ faces. I could see the anger, fear, frustration and hurt expressed as tears, and a stoic defiance which Jews relied on to keep going through thousands of years and countless attempts at our annihilation where Jews have faced expulsions, state-sanctioned pogroms and ultimately, the Holocaust. As two years of pandemic fears subside, campus feels ‘normal’ again for many, but not for the Jewish community at UBC. The emotions felt inside the forum did not abate. The next few weeks were communal therapy, stretched out over coffee chats, walks in the sun, study sessions, prayer andShabbatdinners held behind the bullet-resistant glass and reinforced doors of Hillel and Chabad. The Jewish community did what we have always done in the face of adversity, discrimination and marginalization — we came together, to cry and mourn so we could heal, to heal so we could persevere and to persevere so we could live and thrive as joyous and proud Jews. I cannot say for sure what was written on my face in these weeks besides a dull, burning anger — anger that my community and friends were hurting, that they were checking in frantically on loved ones in Israelas terroristattacksbecamea regularoccurrenceand that nobody else seemed to care. Lying in bed at night I’d wake up in fits, with an icy grip of fear clenching my stomach and a terrifying, paralyzing sense of dread. My mind kept circling back to a logo on the Divestment Coalition Solidarity Statement: AMS SASC. SASC has a “commitment to the education, support, and empowerment of people of all genders and identities who have experienced sexualized violence.” It appears that SASC failed to recognize that many Jews and Israelis carry trauma because of this conflict — that doesn’t phase me. My tenure at UBC has given me time to recognize institutional apathy and ignorance as the norm on campus — especially when it comes to antisemitism and violence against Jews. SASC’s Support and Advocacy team istrained“to provide confidential and non-judgemental emotional … support.” I naively believed SASC would acknowledge that Jews, Israelis and Palestinians have experienced individual and communal trauma as a product of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and that it would engage in good faith, with curious minds and an open heart to all involved. So, the day after the motion passed, I sent the SASC this email: Three months later, I have yet to hear back. As a man and a survivor of sexual assault, I am no stranger to being disbelieved, shamed and silenced. As a descendant of Holocaust survivors, I am no stranger to having my family history of persecution and genocide be appropriated, distorted and denied, being told that “others have it worse” and to “get over it.” I will admit, I still struggle with being disbelieved. These are the parts of me I paper over with the love of my family, friends and community, bywrapping tefillinand by living the most joyful and Jewish life I can live. What hurts more is being ignored — to not even have the opportunity to be disbelieved. I refuse to remain ignored any longer. This letter is a reply to your violent silence: the kind of silence that views Jewish and Israeli trauma as discardable, marginal and irrelevant. SASC ignored my trauma as a Jewish and Israeli student. I feel compelled to speak up because I know I am not the only Jewish survivor that felt marginalized by SASC’s endorsement of divestment, a decision taken without any consultation with any Jewish AMS or university affiliated organization on campus. Palestinians carry intergenerational trauma stemming from Israeli-Palestinian conflict. SASC has so far refused to acknowledge Jewish and Israeli intergenerational trauma. Acknowledging Jewish pain, loss and suffering does not diminish Palestinian pain, loss and suffering, unless you view this conflict as a zero-sum game. Failing to hear Jewish and Israeli voices and failing to respond to survivors like myself is not an act of solidarity with Palestinians, but an alienation of the Jewish and Israeli communities which SASC is supposed to serve. SASC claims to be a trauma-informed organization — its signature on the divestment motion and the process by which that decision was taken calls that claim into question for me and other Jews on campus. In this case, to be selectively informed is to be misinformed. In the best light, SASC support for the divestment motion is a sincere expression of acommitment to resisting colonialism, rooted in the understanding that colonialism, genocide and sexualized violence are traumatizing experiences which overlap. You have been convinced that the world’s only Jewish state is somehow a vestige of European colonialism. Since SASC has chosen not to engage with the Jewish and Israeli community and continues to ignore the concerns of survivors like me, it falls on us to start the conversation. This is not right and this is not fair, but we are used to it — life has been unfair for Jews for thousands of years. I am a survivor. I am a survivor of sexual assault. I deal with the fact that my boundaries were violated, that my voice was silenced and that like many survivors, I will not be believed when I share my story. My Judaism is a fundamental part of my story, and vital to my personal journey of healing. The fact that I am Jewish and alive is a miracle. I am alive thanks to the courage, tenacity and resilience of my relatives who survived: who chose their love of life over the immeasurable grief and guilt to know that so many of their friends, families and communities were utterly destroyed. This is what unites all of us, no matter what we have suffered, that we as Jews continue to choose life and continue to vow “Never Again!” For all Jews today, “Never Again!” is a vow. And for the vast majority of Jews part of that vow is embodied in having a Jewish state with an army to defend it. This is modernZionismat its essence. It is a belief that if we had a Jewish state in 1938, millions more Jews would be alive today. Hearing Jewish and Israeli perspectives does not deny or delegitimize Palestinian rights to self-determination or their national aspirations for a state of their own. Palestinians are connected to the same land I, and the vast majority of Jews, hold to be inextricable to our identity. I know for a fact that the Palestinian connection to the land and Palestinian experiences were conveyed with eloquence and sincerity by Palestinian students and activists to SASC. Jewish and Palestinian self-determination in the land need not be exclusive — that is a political choice. Jewish and Palestinian well-being and safety on campus should not be exclusive, either. To deny Jewish and Israeli students the same opportunity to share our experiences and stories tells me that they are discardable, marginal and unimportant to the conversation. Choosing to ignore Jewish and Israeli students will not ‘liberate’ Palestine. All it does is call into question your organizational capacity to provide equal and non-judgemental support to all survivors of sexualized violence. Every day SASC chooses not to engage with Jewish and Israeli lived experiences and trauma caused by the conflict is another day Jewish survivors of sexualized violence like myself must ask whether our trauma and survival will be treated with the same dignity and respect as our peers. What I want most is for SASC to listen to the Jewish community, in the spirit of its mandate to support all survivors on this campus. It must acknowledge that it wounded Jewish survivors of sexualized violence, even if it did not intend to. It needs to listen and learn from the Jewish community, to understand our communal history and the intergenerational trauma. These steps help me heal and help to rebuild Jewish community trust in SASC. It would also allow SASC to better understand intergenerational trauma, and thereby hopefully better support all survivors. Today, going to SASC for support feels alienating and painful. I fear my trauma will be misunderstood. I feel that to get support from SASC requires leaving fundamental pieces of myself at the door to be welcome. All students deserve to feel safe and supported when they experience sexual violence. Right now, many Jews at UBC are not able to count on that from SASC. I hope that can still change.

rice_thresher_2022_7,"ByBen Baker-KatzandMorgan Gage11/1/22 11:59pm Party culture is back, babes. We’ve got publics nearly every weekend, Pub every Thursday and freshmen scoping out the best (read: most awkward parties on campus. While we’re excited to welcome back a “return to normal,” there’s been a concerning increase in dangerous drinking habits on-campus. In the wake of consistently high numbers of alcohol related transports and students being found passed out drunk and alone, we’re calling on Rice students to think about what it means to be a good friend and community member in situations where alcohol is involved. Before going any further, we want to be clear: welovealcohol. We both drank heavily freshman year, and while our alcohol consumption has decreased since then, we both still drink regularly — sometimes to excess. In our time at Rice, we have never been seriously worried about the state of drinking or party culture on this campus. But we are worried right now. We live on a college campus. Drinking should be expected. Drinking to excess should be expected. It’s a common, dare we say necessary, part of the college experience. But the existence of that environment does not alleviate students from the responsibilities embodied in the culture of care. We know that referencing the culture of care usually elicits eyerolls from most undergrads, but all it really boils down to is being a good person. The culture of care is not just calling for medical assistance when your friends have too much to drink — it is ensuring they don’t get to a state where that call is necessary to begin with. It’s not pouring them another drink when you realize they’re too drunk. It’s making sure that one of your friends who’s been drinking isn’t left alone — either of their own volition or yours. Sure, we need to be more conscious of our limits when it comes to alcohol and not push those limits unnecessarily. You don’t have to keep up with what your friends are drinking, you can take breaks or stop drinking throughout the night. But that isn’t the problem. Drinking, even when large portions of campus are messily drunk, does not concern us. What’s concerning is that dangerous drinking culture is being viewed as a series of mistakes made by an individual rather than evidence that we aren’t caring enough for each other on a community level. We shouldn’t have to say this: don’t ditch your friends when they’re drunk. Don’t ditch a single member of the Rice community when they’re drunk. Even worse, don’t think that their intoxication isn’t your problem. If we want to call ourselves a community, then it’s all of our problem. There are rumors going around that campus is one bad night away from going dry. While we don’t blame administrators if they are considering that option, we want to state for the record that we believe that to be a terrible idea. Whether campus is dry or wet, alcohol will be prevalent; that’s the reality of a college campus. On a dry campus, EMS calls will drop, instances of public intoxication will drop, but problematic drinking habits will not disappear. Instead, they’ll be hidden. Drinking will be conducted in secret, and students will be more hesitant to reach out for help when needed for fear of punishment. The solution is not to eliminate alcohol, but to reform the drinking culture that’s been established so far this semester. As a community, we need to treat this as the cultural problem it is, so the administration isn’t forced to treat it like a policy issue. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

Over the first year of the pandemic, Stanford demonstrated its commitment to COVID-19 response—and especially, to COVID-19 vaccination campaigns—in a number of ways. In 2020, Stanford Medicine conductedvaccine trials against COVID-19. In 2021, Stanford wasearly torequire the primary series of the COVID-19 vaccine, a mandate which was met withhigh compliance. But throughout the second and third year of the pandemic, which in Americawere nearly as fatal as the first, the University has stripped those protections away: first dispensing with mandatory testing for faculty and students, then dedicated quarantine facilities for students living on campus. And this fall, Stanford has done little, very late, to inform its community that a new booster, with the potential tosave nearly 100,000 livesin the next six months if enough people get it, is now available and that most community members are eligible to receive it. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices moved to recommend a bivalent booster targeted at BA.4 and BA.5, the currently circulating Omicron subvariants, on September 1, 2022. But it wasn’t until yesterday that Stanford sent itsfirst University-wide communicationdedicated to promoting uptake of the booster—and only in one that simultaneously removed the classroom mask mandate. Before that email, Stanford greeted this development with almost-total silence–making only one very cursory mention of the shot buried in the middle of aStanford Report emailsent on October 4. The information was not included in a number of communications in which one might expect to find it: not in a university-wide welcome message from President Marc Tessier-Levigne, not in any of the university life newsletters through the month of September, including in those promoting flu vaccine clinics, and not even in the “Important COVID-19 and Monkeypox Update” sent toundergraduateandgraduatestudents on September 7, six days after the bivalent booster was recommended by CDC. Nor have Stanford’s many subdivisions put in much effort toward promoting vaccine uptake: at the start of quarter, I had a dozen friends, across Stanford divisions and departments, comb through their inboxes for mentions of the bivalent booster. The only one we found was sent by Stanford Medical School. This is a shame, because the booster is great. Laboratory studies reviewed by CDCindicatethat the new booster induces immune responses four times stronger against circulating variants than did the previous version (which was tailored to older strains of the virus . And almost all Stanford community members areeligible to get it: Anyone whose last COVID-19 vaccine was more than two months ago is. Availability of the vaccine has been patchy, but with some persistence, you can get appointments for the shot at theWalgreens in Vaden Health Center,most localpharmacies, orStanford Health Care. Getting the shot is free, it takes fifteen minutes, and it isone of the most impactful things you can doto prevent yourself from getting – or spreading – COVID-19. While we are lucky to have low transmission on campus right now, the country is nonetheless in a precarious moment of the pandemic. About 400 Americans are dying per day of COVID-19, making the disease thethird leading cause of deathin the United States, behind only heart disease and cancer. Health officials and epidemiologists arepredicting yet another wavein the fall and winter, with early indications of an uptick already materializingin some parts of the country. Meanwhile, county governments and institutions have removed most non-pharmaceutical interventions, from surveillance testing to mask mandates, withno signsthat they will reinstate them in the event of rises in hospitalization or death counts. You might think that, given these conditions, the federal government would blast news of the booster from the rooftops and launch a full-scale campaign to get as many people vaccinated as possible. Unfortunately, that is not what is happening. Federal support ofvaccine outreach and promotionhas halted because the Biden administrationfailed to push funding for COVID-19 responsethrough Congress. Preliminary data indicates that, one month into the campaign for a bivalent vaccine that72% of Americanshave said they would get,less than 4%of Americans had actually received a shot. This lack of uptake continues a trend of America’s booster campaign lagging far behind other countries with comparable supplies of boosters— leading to disproportionately high and preventable death tolls. As much as this national failure to run a robust booster campaign restricts what Stanford can accomplish, it also places a special obligation on Stanford to endorse the booster in order to promote collective public health. First of all, based onpolling conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, one in five eligible adults have heard nothing about the new booster shot and over half are unsure whether they are eligible—or even believe they are not eligible. Stanford has a very important role to play in ensuring that its community members actually hear about the new shot. Second, universities form an essential part of the civic fabric of America; they are “semi-public” institutions that can disseminate reliable information during confusing times and set the tenor of public conversation. When many universities moved to require the COVID-19 vaccine last year–or even just recommend them–they placed an expectation of its widespread availability on the US government and sent a clear message about the safety, effectiveness and importance of vaccines to the American public. These interventions are not just symbolic: They make real differences to the health of the communities in which universities are situated. In fall of 2021, according to aworking paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, university vaccine mandates reduced case counts by over 300 per 100,000 people in their home counties and saved an estimated 8,000 lives nationwide. In fact, Stanford’s long silence on the COVID-19 booster may have been routine within the United States as a whole, but it is unusual among its peer universities, the majority of which have recognized this important role of universities in promoting collective public health and taken prompt steps to promote the new vaccine. By the beginning of October, 9 of the top 50 universities had moved to mandate students receive the bivalent booster, including the entire University of California system. 29hadsentoutdedicatedmessagesaddressedtotheirentireuniversitycommunityor posted prominentwebsitenoticesencouraginguptakeoftheshot. And at least 8 already hadsystemsinplacetotrackinformationabouthowmany of their students have received the bivalent booster, which Stanford still does not. Stanford’s failure to enthusiastically and promptly endorse the shot is all the more striking in light of the role that many of its affiliates, like Jay Bhattacharya, Michael Levitt, and John Ioannidis – as well as employees of the Hoover Institute, like Scott Atlas – have played inpoisoningthe public conversation about COVID-19 vaccination in general and about this booster in particular. (Bhattacharya, specifically, has advocated against the CDC’srecommendation of the new shot— and universitiesrequiring it— on the grounds of amisleading, fear-mongering claimthat the vaccines do not have “any human safety data” associated with them. In failing to communicate about the importance of the bivalent booster for so long, Stanford abrogated its responsibility to distance itself from claims like Bhattacharya’s. It is not too late for Stanford to improve its approach to the bivalent vaccine campaign. Now that Stanford has finally announced its recommendation of the booster, in the coming weeks, it should, at the very least, send frequent, repeated reminders to students, faculty, and staff to receive it across university communications. It should create a system to track how many of us have received it. It should hold drop-in clinics for the booster, similar to those it runs for flu shots. And it should thoroughly update all its COVID-19 materials – including itsout-of-date COVID-19 Vaccinations Page, which makes no mention of the bivalent booster – with recommendations to receive the booster and information about how to receive it. Moreover, COVID-19 vaccination is likely to become ayearly routine, and this year’s lack of a timely and enthusiastic campaign should not set the template for future years. COVID-19 vaccination campaigns must join yearly flu vaccine campaigns as a University public health priority, rather than an afterthought. When University President Marc Tessier-Levigne wrote anemailto the community on the first day of quarter, he heralded the start of a year where “our ‘new normal’ feels much more normal.” But as the death count continues to mount, as theinequalitiesmarking COVID outcomes grow still more chasmic, and as the informal network of social supports that allowed people to scrape by the past few years crumbles to nothing, the abandonment of basic public health commitments by institutions with the responsibility to uphold them does not feel normal. It feels morally and politically grotesque. If there is anything normal about it, it’s not a normal worth preserving. So Stanford, please do the bare minimum: Enthusiastically endorse the booster. Devote resources to ensuring community members get it. Keep track of how many of us have gotten it. The university can do much more than this to promote public health justice. To achieve anything close to a “normal” worth aspiring toward, it cannot do less. Kara Schechtman is a master’s student in the Symbolic Systems program.

Half-an-hour sets may feel criminally short, but the stages are rotating which should ensure minimal delays in transitioning from one performance to the next. Additionally, the acts headlining the festival will undoubtedly be given more time than less prevalent ones. However, the overcrowded roster of bands may still leave their appearances feeling rushed. The relatively short performance times windows are one example of how When We Were Young’s massive scale may work to its detriment. The festival is expected to last 12 hours each day, which may be overwhelming for concert-goers due to fatigue and possible scheduling conflicts between their favorite artists. Given these logistical concerns, the pricing and ticket refund policy of the festival hasfaced increased scrutiny. Live Nation has stipulated that all ticket sales are final, unless the festival is canceled. This is also consistent with their usual policy for all festivals they organize, but fans are worried due to the perception that When We Were Young could be a disappointing experience. General Admission (GA tickets cost $244.99 each while GA+ tickets cost $419.99 each. According totheir website, the only added bonuses of the extra $170 are “air-conditioned bathrooms” and a “dedicated entry lane at the main entrance.” It is shameful that bathrooms with fresh air circulation are barred behind such a large paywall. Live Nation organizesover a hundred festivalseach year, including Travis Scott’s 2021 Astroworld Festival. Although Scott should bear the brunt of the responsibility for the event — given that he has oftenincited reckless behaviorfrom his fans in the past — Live Nation should still be paying special attention to the safety of their customers. To the credit of the When We Were Young festival, it is highly unlikely that any of its artists will promote the overcrowding that led to the fatal crowd surging at the Astroworld Festival likeScott did. The three separate stages should also help to prevent suchdangerous compressionas well. Despite these improvements from the devastating and traumatic Astroworld Festival, Live Nation has continued to fail to properly provide for its customers. Their predatory pricing methods force fans to bolster their profits in exchange for a safer festival experience. Air-conditioned bathrooms help to alleviate exhaustion, which is crucial in a hectic concert environment. According to the WHO, they “reduce the riskof the corona virus spreading indoors.” In all likelihood, the highly contagious and deadly disease will still be prevalent come October. So Live Nation should give all attendees access to such bathrooms regardless of how much they pay — as contracting the coronavirus can result in lifelong complications or death for a concert goer or someone they love. Ultimately the appeal of the festival’s lineup is marred by the safety concerns and harmful pricing practices that suggest a lack of consideration for fans. While I don’t think that the When We Were Young festival is a complete scam — like the infamous Fyre Festival that many have drawncomparisonsto — I do believe that the festival’s organizers are exploiting fans. The highly anticipated festival may manage to partly recapture the glory of the emo genre’s height, but it also proves that the ones who “were once young” have matured enough to become a target demographic to profit off of.

crimson_2022_19,"Content Warning: This op-ed deals with discussions of sexual assault and harassment. A couple of weeks ago, The Editorial Board published a piece aboutstudent safetyon Harvard’s campus. Afterarguinglast Fall that Harvard Yard should close its gates after 10 p.m. to improve the safety of its student population, this year, the Board offered a differing opinion, arguing that the real threat lies inside — as opposed to outside — the gates of Harvard Yard. We argued that fearing non-Harvard Cambridge residents unfairly depicts them as “as an alien menace” and retracted our previous position on locking the gates at night. Ever since we opined on this topic, I’ve thought a lot about the reality of danger in Cambridge and how it differs from popular notions of safety in the city. Cambridge is not “dangerous,” and yet I call my parents for moral support when I have to walk back from Lamont to my dorm room alone at 2 a.m. Cambridge is not “dangerous,” yet I hold my breath and pick up my walking pace when I get cat-called on the street. If Cambridge is not dangerous, why is it scary to navigate it all alone in the dark of night? Because it feels dangerous – not just for me, but for many women. Recentresearchshows that women’s perception of their personal safety at night greatly differs from men’s. While about 20 percent of men felt unsafe walking in a busy public space at night, almost 50 percent of women felt unsafe walking in the same type of environment. This discrepancy in perceptions of personal safety did not change in a differing environment either. While almost 40 percent of men felt unsafe walking in a park or another open space at night, a little over 80 percent of women felt unsafe walking in that same environment. This variation in experience by gender suggests that this is a burden most heavily felt by women. This doesn’t come as surprising as nearly99 percentof perpetrators of sexual misconduct are men. It’s no wonder then that men feel overwhelmingly more safe alone at night than women. The problem here is that women are holding the burden of fear while they shouldn’t have to. Instead, we should be restructuring the way in which our society holds perpetrators of sexual misconduct – which are almost always men – accountable for their actions. We are in need of a stark cultural shift – one that places the burden upon men to simply be better people. In the aftermath of sexual misconduct, it shouldn’t be so hard for our society to believe women when they come forward and say that they’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted. The courage it takes to share their story is not always so easily developed. And it’s easy to see why. Once women share such vulnerable, terrifying experiences they’ve endured, they aren’t always believed — especially when the person who may have harassed or assaulted them is a well-known and well-liked public figure. While movements such as#MeToohave done a lot to helpdismantlethe culture of victim blaming as it demonstrated the wide extent to which sexual misconduct has affected women, there is still a cultural hesitancy to believe women. And, even worse? There seems to be a legal hesitancy as well. Research has shown that only2 percentof perpetrators of rape are convicted and imprisoned. Sexual misconduct is a hard thing to prove in the court of law. When you couple that with societal norms in a patriarchal system, it is no wonder that it provesdifficultto try cases of sexual assault and harassment. Considering the high likelihood that a previous perpetrator of sexual misconduct may be wandering our campus or the greater area plus the fact that victims of sexual misconduct overwhelmingly tend to be women, it is no wonder that it is women who are holding the burden of fear when navigating their day-to-day lives. This is a problem that is everywhere – both within Harvard’s gates and beyond them. Just because the public safety numbers on areportmay make Cambridge seem “safe” does not mean that it feels that way. And the Editorial Board has no right to suggest otherwise. Navigating a still slightly unknown city without fear is a privilege — one that usually isn’t afforded to students who identify as women or are femme-presenting. Being fearful of the Cambridge community is not unbridled alarmism, as the Editorial Board puts it, but a genuine fear that is rooted in the mass amount of violence seen against women. To say that it is anything other than that demonstrates privilege. A privilege to not have to be fearful. While I recognize that Cambridge is considered the “second safest city” in the country, if anything, the fact that there is a lack of perceived personal safety should serve as an indication that there is something seriously wrong with our society and our world. In order to correct this, we’re going to have to take a good hard look at how we talk about sexual misconduct and where we place the blame for its occurrence. Nicole B.

OnOct. 7, a woman reported that she was dragged from her office and raped in a University building. On Oct. 8, Stanford students received an email entitled, “Update on assault report.” As I read this email, I felt a growing and implacable sense of discomfort. Here are a few extracts from the email: “First and foremost, DPS is actively investigating yesterday’s report, based on the limited information that is available thus far.” “Because of the limited information currently available—” “Second, the nature of these crime alerts can often be unclear to our community.” “The initial report to DPS may include very little information.” “This is why some alerts to the community, in turn, may have very little information.” “Currently, the victim who reported being assaulted yesterday has chosen not to share information about the crime with the police at this time. This also remains the case for the August report, which remains under investigation.” “We encourage victims of sexual violence to come forward so that law enforcement and the university can assist.” After reading the entire email, despite my discomfort, I thought to myself, “Okay, so that’s why the University is unable to do anything.” Unable to do anything about this terrifying and extremely traumatic event. Unable to do anything about a horrifyingly similar assault case onAug. 9. When some of my female friends mentioned that they were feeling similar discomfort about the email, I realized that my reaction is exactly what Stanford wanted out of its students. By repeatedly emphasizing that the University simply does not have enough information to carry out any sort of justice or reforms, they place the onus onto the victim.Victims, come forward so that we can help you. Otherwise, our hands are tied. I can’t overstate how insidious and incorrect this narrative is. There are so many essential actions that Stanford could take, but chooses to avoid. Instead, Stanford is a university thatchoosesto retainVincent Barletta, a tenured associate professor who sexually assaulted and harassed his students. He has three Title IX cases filed against him — incredibly brave victims of sexual violence coming forward. Stanford is a university thatchoseto namea libraryin honor of another rapist professor,Jay Fliegelman, despite acknowledging that hesexually harassed his student. Stanford is a university thatchosetoexpel onlytwostudents for sexual assault in its entire history. I have several friends who were victims of sexual violence at Stanford and did not take their cases to Title IX. They do not trust a process that is ostensiblyslow, obscure and prolongs survivors’ traumainstead of fighting for their safety. 71% of undergraduate women and 81% of transgender and gender nonconforming students are concerned that Stanford officialswould not conduct a fair investigationif someone were to report a sexual assault at Stanford. This is a colossal institutional failure. Despite these continual failures, Stanfordchoosesto shirk blame and silence our anger. Last year, ResEdremoved postersprotesting Stanford’s systemic failures in addressing sexual violence, calling the posters “terribly harmful to members of our community” and “antithetical to the type of supportive environment we are trying to cultivate and sustain at Stanford.” Do you know whatisterribly harmful to members of our community, Stanford? Do you know whatisantithetical to a supportive environment? Your failure to address the fact that rape happens here. Your inaction. Your silencing. “As we always do, we recommend taking steps to provide for your personal safety. Be aware of your surroundings; carry a cell phone to connect quickly with 911 if you are concerned about a situation, or use one of the blue emergency towers placed around campus to do so.” After we read the August crime alert, my friends and I immediately ordered pepper spray. We knew that it was up to ourselves to protect ourselves. In class, keychains thrown casually on desks feature pom poms, trinkets and self-defense weapons. This should not have to be our campus norm. Even if we choose to take Stanford’s word that they are essentially unable to investigate the recent assaults, Stanford’s hands arenottied. Here are several easy measures that Stanford could take without delay to protect students: – Publicizingself-defense classesand reinstatingevidence-based programsagainst sexual violence – Building more blue boxes whichmustbe consistently functional. One out of order is too many – Strongly lighting all areas of campus from sunset to dawn – Funding the Confidential Support Team – Consulting with survivors and sexual violence experts to rethink Stanford’s Title IX processes – Instituting comprehensive consent education in mandatory curriculum This is so cheap, Stanford. This is so cheap. Even instituting just one of these measures could help prevent another person’s life from being permanently scarred. The “Safety Recommendations” that Stanforddoesoffer us, from the original crime alert: “We are all responsible for each other in addition to ourselves.” My friends and I should not have to keep each other on call as we bike home at night through Stanford’s campus. We should not have to have our thumbs on the trigger of pepper spray while walking home from a party. Stanford“endeavors to promote a culture of community accountability”to paper over their continuous, willful and systemic failures to protect members of the Stanford community. “Upstanders have the power to stop assaults and to get help for people who have been victimized.” Stanford has the power to stop assaults and to get help for people who have been victimized. Stanford could make steps towards this direction, but instead pushes responsibility onto students and community members to both “stop assault” and help victims. In many cases, there is no way for any individual, let alone an untrained individual, to do either of these things. Stanford is trained. Stanford has so many resources. Where is Stanford in this statement? When will Stanford choose to step up and stop forcing the onus onto survivors and students? When will Stanford choose our safety over its self-protection?

ubyssey_2022_7,"Sept. 14, 2022 Written byCharlotte Alden As news editor, I spent two years writing about the need for transparency from the university and the AMS. It s student money funding the institution therefore students should know how it s spent. To me, it felt like a key part ofThe Ubyssey spurpose. ButThe Ubysseyisn t good at transparency. We don t properly advertise our finances, our annual general meeting or the student positions on our Board of Directors, and our key editorial guidelines and policies aren t easily accessible. Since I was elected coordinating editor in May, I ve been working on updating some of our internal policies and creating some clearer public-facing documents on how we run and why we make the decisions we do. Those pages are now live on our website. On the How we run page, there s a brief overview of howThe Ubysseyis managed and makes decisions. There are also public links to five key policies that inform how we respond to different requests. OurAnonymity Policyis also clearly outlined. A new addition is ourUnpublishing Policy. As newspapers across the county revamp their unpublishing rules to reflect the impact of a digital footprint, we wanted to do that too. In this policy, we ve defined a commitment to the public record and transparency with our audience, but with flexibility built in to reflect the need for compassion when it comes to unpublishing requests. We also recognize that our perceptions of risk and harm don t always match those of our sources. This policy forces us to interrogate our biases and perspectives when we make these decisions. We ve also released asource guidethat s deeply inspired by Toronto Metropolitan University s student newspaper,The Eyeopener ssource guide. Here, we outline what it means to be aUbysseysource and answer some commonly-asked questions. We also knowThe Ubysseyneeds to be more transparent with its finances. We demand the university and AMS tell us where student money is going and when, but we get hundreds of thousands of dollars from students every year and haven t been as transparent about how that money is used as we should be. Ourfinancial updateis now live on our website, written by our Business Manager, Douglas Baird. It includes some graphics that show where our money is spent and how we re doing financially. It also outlines our financial projections for the next few years — spoiler: things are looking up for us. If you re interested in further information onThe Ubyssey sbudget and budget breakdown, emailbusiness@ubyssey.ca. I see this as just the start.The Ubysseyshied away from student engagement during the beginning of the pandemic — partly because of us trying to do our jobs as best as we could while living in a deeply troubling time. Engagement fell off, but we want to be better. We want to remind you all that we are students who run your student newspaper, not just a group of faceless people who live tweet all the AMS Council meetings.

state_press_2022_69,"No one wants to see homelessness. It makes us nervous, uncomfortable, or sad. Maybe we feel guilt, pity, or judgmental for the mistakes we assume were made. “I feel like you grow up guided to notlook at these people when you walk past them, to not interact because strangers are dangerous,” said Sarah Hartley, a second-year law student at the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law. It’s an issue that is getting harder to ignore. Affordable housing is scarce, and it is impacting our peers. Misconceptions make it easy to be insensitive and hard to make changes. That lack of compassion leads to indifference, and we lose touch with our own humanity when we stop seeing people as human. At the very least we need to better understand this issue, and be more compassionate toward our unsheltered neighbors. “Homelessness doesn’t pick a population – it can literally happen to anybody,” said Amy Schwabenlender, Executive Director ofHuman Services Campus. HSC is a 13-acre campus about a mile southwest of ASU’s Downtown Phoenix campus, where 16 nonprofit social service organizations provide temporary shelter and services for individuals experiencing homelessness. Atlast count, there were over 9,000 people experiencing homelessness in Maricopa County, more than half without shelter. With increased inflation and housing costs, those numbers will likely continue to grow. Nearly a quarter of people who are unhoused are under the age of 24. In fact, the number of 18 to 24-year-olds has increased by 41% in the past two years – the largest increase of any age group. Many people who are working find themselves in unstable housing situations. According to Schwabenlender, 20 to 25% of people who come to HSC are employed. That’s not surprising, given that per RentCafe the average rent in Phoenix is almost $1,600 a month, and in Tempe, it’s $1,900. “There are students who reach out and say, ‘I’m going to be homeless,’ or ‘I am homeless,’ and they want to keep going to school,” Schwabenlender said. “But they don’t know where they’re going to sleep at night.” READ MORE:Opinion: ASU needs to focus on its housing crisis Being without shelter creates stress and leaves people exposed to harsh conditions. The Guardianreportedin July that as many as 500 homeless people died in Maricopa County in the first half of 2022, which is almost as many as the medical examiner reported in all of 2021. Schwabenlender said she often sees people prey on the HSC population, leading to theft, physical abuse and trafficking. “People who are on the streets are much more likely to be a victim of crime than they are to commit a crime against somebody else,” said Shana Ellis, Executive Director ofAction Nexuson Housing and Homelessness. Action Nexus is a public service team within the Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions at ASU, created with the help of Human Services Campus in 2020 to encourage collaboration among the different support systems in Maricopa County and to connect them with ASU resources to address the issue of homelessness. Ellis said it will take time and money to change the system to meet the growing needs, but the most important element is the political will. Students who notice the growing number of people who are unsheltered around campus too often choose to complain over compassion. Ellis said the important thing is that people are noticing. “People are paying attention,” Ellis said. “That dialogue you’ve noticed really beginning to start onRedditand (with a lot of the students, that’s not necessarily a bad thing.” Some dialogue can be harmful, though. For instance, Schwabenlender said political ads that tie homeless people to crime are misleading. Ads that use derogatory language and exploit this issue to instill fear and indifference may increase as we get closer to the November election. “There’s nothing that’s the same about the 1,800 people in our neighborhood today,” Schwabenlender said, “other than the fact that they don’t have a place to live.” If the political will is needed, then indifference makes things worse. Hartley recently heard a classmate on campus casually describe herself as looking homeless. “Like what does that mean? To look like you don’t have a place to rest your head? What you mean to say is that you look dirty,” Hartley said, “or that you don’t like your clothes, or that you look unclean. But you don’t look homeless, because what does your housing situation have to do with the way you’re dressed right now?” Hartley, who works with ASU sHomeless Legal Assistance Project, believes that mentality is reflected in city services, like budgets and policing. This can be seen in the allegations being investigated by theDepartment of Justiceof excessive force and abuse of homeless people by Phoenix Police, or in the tragedy this summer when Tempe Police watched as a homeless man drowned. “A week before, they saved a dog,” Hartley said. We can do better. We’re not immune from circumstances that may lead to homelessness, and we should be sensitive to the reality that our peers may have unstable living situations. In fiscal year 2021-22, the city of Tempe was able to accelerate its efforts to provide resources for those experiencing homelessness through itsHomeless Outreach Prevention Effortby hiring more specialists. The team has nine dedicated certified behavioral health technicians who can put people experiencing homelessness in contact with mental health and medical care. The services also include an allocation of basic necessities and referrals to emergency shelters as well as support in navigating the path to secure housing. The HOPE team can be contacted at 480-350-8950. Ambassadors withDowntown Phoenix Inc., a nonprofit organization that works to “promote the continued revitalization of downtown,” are available to help refer people in need to assistance programs for substance abuse treatment, housing, shelter, food, jobs and health care, according to the Downtown Phoenix Inc.website. Ambassadors wear orange shirts and are available seven days a week, every day of the year, the website says. For more information, you can call 602-495-1500. If you are a student experiencing homelessness, you can contact theDean of Studentsfor your campus. There are resources and processes in place. ASU Police said in an email that visitors who are homeless can access public areas on campus, but if you see an individual who may need assistance you can reach out to ASU Police at 480-965-3456.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_16,"Dear New University and UCI community, Since 1968, the New University has strived to be the primary source for UCI and Irvine news. Now in our 54th year as a student-run independent publication, we encourage you to support us in our endeavor, theNew University Student Fee Referendum, as a way to remain the No. 1 source for our community. As a “for UCI students, by UCI students” publication, our 11 section team — Campus News, City News, STEM, Arts and Entertainment, Opinion, Sports, Photo, Social Media, Video, Copy and Graphic Design — consists of UCI students who dedicate 10+ hours per week as members of the New University. For the past four years, this dedication has been completely voluntary and done without staff compensation. Along with the absence of staff compensation, the New U has not instated a weekly printed newspaper since 2018. The purpose of the New University Student Fee Referendum is to provide necessary resources for the campus newspaper, secured student staff salary, reintroduction of a printed newspaper, access to personal New U equipment and software, and staff support resources. With the funds obtained, the New University will continue to expand its reporting as a student-run newspaper and preserve student journalism at UCI. For $1 per quarter or $3 annually, which is equivalent to just 0.01¢ per day for the nine-month academic year, we would greatly appreciate it if you could consider supporting the legacy that the New University has built — a legacy to provide credible and fact-checked news to our community. Without the passing of the New University Student Fee Referendum, our team of 80+ Editors, Interns and Contributing Writers will continue their efforts in formulating pitches, writing and editing articles without guaranteed staff compensation. Furthermore, the re-introduction of the printed newspaper would be put on pause and continue to face an indefinite future. It is critical that the New University staff’s efforts are appreciated, and it is critical that the legacy of the New U newspaper can be maintained through a print edition. Without the New U team’s dedicated weekly efforts, the New University would cease to exist as UCI’s official campus newspaper. Moreover, the reintroduction of a print issue assists in maintaining the fundamental legacy of our newspaper — an era of UCI student journalists who utilize print to inform students of the breaking stories of the quarter — and will allow the campus community to retain a piece of UCI history, acting as a memento that can be tangibly held. Not only will the passing of the New University Student Fee Referendum support our goal of reintroducing printed newspapers and granting compensation to our staff, but it will also supplement personal New U equipment and software and staff support resources. For the 2021-22 academic year, the STEM and Video sections were introduced to further encompass all aspects of the UCI population, in research and through video modalities, as well as adapt to the evolving journalism industry. Since all six written sections, photo, video and social media rely on visual mediums, personal New U photo and video equipment will increase the quality of the publication’s visual journalistic reporting. Additionally, access to annual software programs and journalism standard AP Style handbooks will assist in upholding the quality and credibility of our campus newspaper. Although the nascent Classifieds ad section was made available in February 2022, it is yet to generate a steady flow of revenue for the publication, likewise with digital tile ads and the Donation page. As a result, the New University Student Fee Referendum will offer the greatest financial stability that the New University will have been granted since 2018. Whether you’re a member of the UCI community, a committed New U reader or someone who’s stumbled upon our publication, we thank you for your continued support of student journalism. Regardless of your affiliation with the New University, the publication will continue our efforts in being your No. 1 source for UCI and Irvine news. Join the New U in supporting our New University Student Fee Referendumhere. Ryan Mikeala Nguyen is the 2021-2022 Editor-in-Chief. She can be reached ateic@newuniversity.org. – Dear Reader, We need your help. To the breaking news-informed, the album review connoisseurs, the sports statistics super fans; to everyone and anyone who cares about the existence of local journalism: we need your help. The New University, UC Irvine’s official campus newspaper, has proudly served you since 1968, three years after the university was founded. What you may not know is that the New University is completely student-run, unaffiliated with any official university entities or departments, including the Literary Journalism program. For 54 years, the New University staff has worked to keep UCI and the surrounding community updated on everything university related, and then some. Being independent from UCI departments, we have the ability to report on UCI administration truthfully with no pressure to paint the university in only a flattering light. Our editors and writers work hard to shine light on controversialadministrative decisions, elevate the issues that student victims ofsexual assultand other crimes have faced with the university’s response, and provide campus-wideCOVID updatesduring these last years of strangeness and uncertainty. But it’s not all negative. Our reporters also work hard to feature the amazing accomplishments of the UCI community. Fromschool sports, to ground breakingscientific research, to some truly exceptionalclubson campus, we have covered it all. And we do all of it for free. The New University has never and does not plan to ever require subscriptions, because we believe giving our community and readership access to all of this information is the ultimate point of local journalism. To be transparent with you, the only way the New University receives funding is through donations and the little ads you may see on the side of your screen. It’s not much, but it’s something and it keeps the paper running. Still, we are starting to run on fumes. Any student who is also working will tell you that it is hard to balance classes and studying and work and a social life and so, so much more. Being on the New University staff is a job, and an important one at that, which requires a heavy time commitment. Journalism isn’t easy. The life cycle of an article from pitch to publication is one that takes many hours in a very small period of time, and our writers and editors produce more than 10 articles every week. Our staff is amazing. We have interns, contributors, staff writers and editors who work countless hours to bring you the content that we have out of sheer will to let you read it. In my honest opinion, they all deserve to be paid. To our UCI student readers, we need you tovoteon the referendum for funding of the New University. We are asking for $1 per student per quarter, a total of $3 from you each school year. Cheaper than one cup of boba. To our non-UCI student readers, we need you to get your UCI friends tovote. Help us give our hard working staff compensation, and help us gain the financial ability to help fund their reporting efforts. Small things — compensating Arts and Entertainment writers for their ticket when they review a movie, providing a travel allowance for sports writers to report on away games — will only help the New University and our content grow and get better and better. Support the New University referendum. Avoteyes means you support your campus newspaper. Avoteyes means you want to keep local journalism alive. Thank you for reading. Dhanika Pineda is the 2021-2022 Managing Editor. She can be reached atmanager@newuniversity.org."
wildcat_arizona_2022_70,"A sunset photo of the Tucson Sunlink tracks around the education building located on UA campus on Aug. 10, 2020. As the countdown to summer time begins, phrases such as “beach body,” “bikini body” and “summer body” start appearing everywhere we turn our heads. Phrases such as “summer body” put the message out there that we have to change our bodies to fit a certain mold when summer approaches. It can be harmful to us and our mental health as the media and diet culture push the idea that there is a specific body type that is better than others. Lisa MacDonald is the coordinator of nutrition services and a nutrition counselor for Campus Health at the University of Arizona. She explained how these phrases reinforce society’s idea that everybody is supposed to look a particular way, which is far from the truth. “All these comments reinforce the narrative that we are not good enough because of our bodies. It makes us believe that there is only one body type,” MacDonald said. Diet culture is a large industry that profits off of our insecurities. When summer time comes around each year, many swimwear companies, gyms, weight loss supplements and fitness plans will use phrases such as “beach body” or “summer body” as a way to market what they are selling. Datashows that the average American woman is a size 16 to 18 in clothing, yet the media typically leads us to believe that we all should strive to fit into the smallest size possible. Everybody’s body is different, and there is no right or wrong way to look. The pressure that social media and society put on us to get our bodies “summer ready” or “bikini ready” can be harmful to us and our mental health and can affect our self-esteem and confidence. TheNational Eating Disorders Associationexplained that about seven in 10 women and girls have experienced a decline in body confidence due to unrealistic beauty standards that are shown in the media. The pressure to change our bodies for summer weather can leave many people feeling insecure and wanting to isolate themselves or miss out on events such as beach or pool days with friends. MacDonald suggested that we should try to have the focus be on the company and the fun memories that we are making instead of focusing on our bodies and how they compare to others. It’s also important to take care of ourselves. Even if the media tells us that we should be getting our bodies “summer ready,” we don’t have to listen. It’s important to hydrate and fuel our bodies and treat ourselves with respect and kindness. “Body respect is important. I don’t have to love my body, I don’t have to hate my body, but I will take care of my body,” MacDonald said. MacDonald said that we can work on shifting our mindset set. We can do our work by changing our own narrative and thoughts. There is no body that is better than another. We all deserve to have fun and make memories. An example MacDonald gave is, “You have a beach and you have a body. There’s your beach body.” Follow Julianna Strano onTwitter Julianna is a senior majoring in journalism and sociology.

ubyssey_2022_56,"Oct. 7, 2022 Written byShane Atienza It’s the start of the school year, and that means upper-year students are wondering what they ve achieved and second-years are wondering what they’d like to achieve as they choose majors. In the Faculty of Arts, both groups are tainted by the stigma and misconceptions associated with the beleaguered arts degree: pointless, easy and a bad bet in an increasingly competitive economy. Unlike my friends in engineering and science, my decision to pursue history and French usually provokes more skepticism than compliments. Such negative attitudes are endemic and many arts majors end up internalizing them. Yet, they’re wrong. The humanities and social sciences (AKA the liberal arts , and the people who study them, are valuable and, indeed, critical in today’s world. In other words, a BA really isn t BS. The classic misconception about arts majors is that they end up sad and jobless. And while sometimes that outcome is beyond our control – the job market is tight and full of gatekeeping – the above is still an easily disprovable myth. Just look at all the BA grads who occupy important positions in our local, national and global communities. UBC BA grads have, and continue to have, meaningful careers in fields like politics, education and journalism. Outgoing UBC President and Vice-Chancellor Santa Ono graduated with a BA andcredits itfor making him a better scientist and educator. Likewise, BC Premier John Horgan and Health Minister Adrian Dix —both of whom have been critical in BC’s pandemic response — are both history grads. And Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earned his English literature degree at McGill (before getting hiseducation degreeat UBC . In fact, every single Canadian prime minister, besides those who went straight into lawyering or politicking, had a BA under their belts. It s not just in politics that we see big-ticket BA holders, either. Countless acclaimed authors, like Margaret Atwood and John Green, also studied the humanities at university. And,according to Forbes, the BA is one of the most popular degrees among Fortune 500 CEOs, including former Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson, interim Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube (who also helped found Google . To put it simply, arts grads run much of the world. Lots of these successful BA grads say their undergraduate training set them up for success. Far from being easy and self-indulgent, the arts is a challenging discipline and its students acquire crucial skills and knowledge about the world from their degree. These students read hundreds of pages of ground-breaking scholastic and cultural work every week. They engage with — and challenge — some of the most important issues and ideas in human history. They’re trained not to accept or expect easy answers and they study debates over issues over which the smartest people have disagreed. Then they have to assemble their own ideas into insightful essays that their profs can then tear to shreds, telling them to do better next time. Then they do just that. Despite knowing that humanities students do in fact have arduous work at uni and end up in important, fulfilling jobs, many still wonder if the arts and social sciences are of any real value to the world. The answer is an emphatic yes. Whether one is studying New Wave cinema, democracy or Indigenous literature, the arts specializes in producing critical thinkers, which has never been more important to the world. In many areas covered in the liberal arts, such as questions about ideal governments, literary style and historical interpretation, there really is no ‘right answer.’ Such lack of clean-cut, definitive answers means arts majors are required to think open-mindedly about abstract concepts, differing viewpoints and their own beliefs to formulate nuanced arguments and defend their positions. Arts students are thus trained to sniff out places where assumptions and ideology shape interpretation and lead to the scourge of misinformation. Although BA students and grads don’t have a monopoly on that — scientists and doctors are vital in combating anti-vaccination ideas, for instance — they can be especially equipped for it. With their emphasis on writing and different forms of communication, the liberal arts also create clear and creative communicators. According to Dr. Raúl Álvarez Moreno, a UBC associate professor of Spanish, the humanistic storytelling and debate skills developed in humanities classes give people the skills to findcommon ground. And all those thesis-driven essays might be exhausting to write, but they train students to be better at persuading people — vital both for the job market, and for creating the connections necessary to build consensus around the issues that matter. The world is diverse and complex, and arts grads who’ve gained valuable cultural perspective are very well positioned, and indeed vital, to tackle racism, reduce global conflict and foster peace. The long reading lists of humanities courses aren’t just padding, and arts curricula don’t just read dead white guys anymore: lots of understanding comes from reading texts from outside ubiquitous, Western perspectives. While identifying historical, social or political contexts behind poverty and anti-Black or Asian racism doesn’t magically solve such problems, it’s key to beginning to combat them. How can we begin to solve issues if we don’t understand how they began? And, although it is undoubtedly true the STEM fields will be essential in tackling global crises like the climate crisis and pandemics,so too will the humanities. The global issues we face today are not only medical or environmental; they arehumanproblems. As Dr. Ono said in a2019 talkabout the humanities, “we need the liberal arts to help make sense of our world — as we grapple with issues like climate change ... and hatred and prejudice ... the humanities can give us the critical thinking skills and the perspective to deal with these issues.” In the end, the value of the humanities and social sciences cannot be overstated. Far from just making latte art, BA grads will leave university with an invaluable, world-changing degree they can be proud of. Shane Atienza is a senior-year student studying history and French.

stanforddaily_2022_65,"Jonathan Garcia is currently a graduate student in the Master of Liberal Arts program. He also works in the Inclusion, Diversity & Purpose department for Discord. He is from Fontana, California. This is my first year on the Stanford campus. As we draw near the end of spring, I am left with a resounding wondering, which I think is shared by my peers —is it always like this? This question brings me deep shame, as I am met with an obvious answer from within myself —of course, and you knew better. It must be. With yet another egregious incident of anti-Black racism and violence — the second time that a noose has been found on University grounds during this academic year — our student population is not left with many other conclusions. As I am learning, Stanford is a rather small school. It presents as very large but our community is small and insular. So acts such as these are especially incendiary. We walk past these people every day. Something about racism that I think gets lost in the perpetual shuffle of diversionary tactics — denials, institutional bureaucracy, statements, panel discussions, academic research, a lack of statements and other forms of misdirection — is that racism brings you closer to death. It is about killing people. It is that simple. Sunday’s affairs have shortened the life span of students on campus. They take hold of space in the brain, and they manifest as a tightness in the body. They tire and weigh down on. They impact the quality of education that we can receive. They contribute to attrition on campus. Friendships wilt. Glances are exchanged, and sighs are shared. And for some, irreversible damage has been caused. Some will never feel safe again in our community. To some others, this may not feel like a major concern, but it should be. Because we can never get those people and their trust back — nor do we deserve that until we receive true answers and solutions. We cannot be surprised that these actions keep happening in this space we share. When you invite prominent guest speakers with long histories of racism and discrimination, when you allow student organizations which antagonize historically marginalized groups to operate on campus, when your student body has been, and continues to be, homogenous at the intersections of privilege — these are the kind of responses that become emboldened on campus. This is the culture we sit on at Stanford. This is the Petri dish that breeds organisms of hate, bigotry and ignorance. It is actually the perfect setting. We cannot be absolved by blaming this all on a few bad actors. Walking through Stanford can be very difficult for anyone not occupying a position of power — I know it has been for me. I have been asked to verify that I am a student on campus multiple times — even by my classmates. When incidents like this occur, you begin to question if you are making up an alternate reality, externally, to validate your feelings, internally. You begin to make excuses for the behavior you are experiencing:Am I exaggerating? Did that really happen? Maybe I am taking this way too personally. This is the great trick that whiteness plays on everyone, including white people — that whiteness is a construction made by each of us, not a construction of the larger system and the history that we share. It prevents you from listening to your intuition. It makes you question what you know and feel. And if whiteness can convince you that you are the one making up these problems, then that means you are alone in solving them. It creates a sense of isolation, and you cannot trust the feelings that you have, nor their sources. And if you determine that you cannot trust yourself, then you surely cannot trust anyone else, which in turn leads to the antagonization and hatred of people who are different from you. This is the state of vulnerability and fear that white supremacy feeds on. It makes us quiet when we should be loud. But knowing about this tactic does not make it any easier. Writing this article has not made me feel any better. I want to be very clear: these recent attacks affect our Black community members first and foremost, and it is their well-being and voices that we should be centering. But to all the non-Black people in our community, this directly impacts you as well. When one person’s safety is threatened, your safety and my safety are threatened, too. We do not treat these threats of hate accordingly because we have a history of re-founding and othering in this country, andthathistory has been rewarded. We also do not treat these threats accordingly because there are rarely concrete outcomes of accountability when actions like this occur. But all our collective well-being will crumble eventually. There are no winners in displays of white supremacy. There are only those who are harmed and those who believe they will not be harmed. Even those who enact violence, however, are deeply impacted by its effects. It is myopic and negligent toward the history of abuses of power to assume that anyone will be left unscathed. That is why weallshould take these moments personally. With the year continuing to unravel here on campus, I return to our principal question —is it always going to be like this?This is not rhetorical. I am looking for answers from our leaders. We need to know how to prepare for what is coming. The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor. We’d love to hear your thoughts.

stanforddaily_2022_115,"In 2018, The New York Times published a piece coveringwomen professionals in STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering and Math at the 2018 Global Women’s Forum in Paris. Two days later, an op-ed byan eighth-grader as a letter to the editorexpressed her appreciation for the piece, but also her concern about the diminishing number of female role models in STEM disciplines. As a graduate student studying in STEM fields, the gender disparity in STEM is not new to me. Even as an undergraduate, I had been used to seeing more men in a room than women. The undergraduate class of engineers in my major started out with approximately18% female enrollment, and at the end of four years reported21.2% female graduates. In graduate school, my incoming engineering major class was20% female. Even so, I still found myself seemingly able to cope and overcome the difficulties of this gender imbalance within the classroom. Unfortunately, my immunity was short-lived. During an engineering internship at a space technology company last summer, at the first staff meeting of my team, I was the only woman in the room (out of roughly 27 engineers . With a single-digit percentage of women, such a clear gender imbalance left me feeling as though I didn’t belong. This feeling only worsened as the internship continued. In the first few days of the internship, I sat in the main building where I saw a handful more women. But over the next week and month, as I was moved to the production floor and, eventually, to the new office built to house roughly a 100 engineers, I could count all the full-time female engineers there on one hand. I realized that I was not alone in feeling the effects of gender disparity more in industry compared to academia. Alejandra Estanislao, a software engineer at Google in Paris, sympathizes with this experience as sherecallsthat her experience in industry was much more “lonely” than her experience in academia. But where do the women go? What experiences do we all collectively face, as an already scant group, in our transition from academia to industry? After all, our training in school ultimately aims to prepare us for the workplace. Is it our own choice, or external factors influencing this choice, that leads women to disappear? Is our choice really evenourchoice? In 2015, astudyout of the University of Vermont reiterated that, although some suggest women choose not to pursue careers in STEM because of a lack of interest,extensiveevidenceindicatesthat women are socialized away from STEM; in other words, sexism makes it difficult for women to pursue their careers of interest. Lower salaries compared to those of men in similar roles, fewer advancement prospects and family matters are common reasons — but with the lack of representation and its impact on the treatment of women, women increasingly choose toexittheir STEM careers, while some join non-STEM fields from the beginning. I wasn’t surprised by the conclusions of these studies. In school, being different was solvable — the less extreme gender distribution and slightly better representation of more senior female academics masked how glaringly out of place I felt; at work, being different was paralyzing. In addition to worse gender statistics in the workplace, an added factor was that success in the classroom usually meant a good letter grade, produced from (mostly objective evaluation — homework, quizzes, exams — and was relatively low stakes. As you get older, however, your academic successes hold much less influence over your professional successes. This is not the case at work, when factors affecting your livelihood are muddied by subjectivity and the biases of how your managers view your potential. The production floor at my internship was relatively gender-homogeneous, and I often felt out of character. And for the first time in my life, this subjective, “out of place” feeling had the potential to influence my performance, my success and my livelihood. When I joined in on my male desk-mates’ banter — a subtle currency that afforded you better seats in the professional hierarchy at the workplace — I was entirely confused about how I was supposed to be treated there: Should I have accepted different treatment because I was fundamentally different, even if it was to my benefit? Or should I have demanded indifference, and strived to get any credit by establishing that I could do a “man’s job”? Experiences throughout the internship did not bring me clarity. About three weeks in, I stopped by the production floor and asked for a box-cutter to strip some fiberglass-insulated wires. A technician pulled out a pocket knife and handed it to me. Standing in front of them, I failed to nonchalantly and coolly unfold the knife within the first five seconds of receiving it, which generated some laughter from the surrounding technicians. I was grateful to the technician from whom I borrowed the knife for quickly showing me how to “work it” and pretended to laugh with the other technicians at my fumbling. But as soon as I turned away, I felt angry. Angry at myself for being so stupid, for being “such a girl.” (I had no idea I was gaslighting myself at the time. But how could I have expected myself to conform to this know-how, when pocket knives are written in mainstream media astraditionally male-possessed items? I wasn’t “rough around the edges” in the same wayBoy Scoutshave beenpraised for(which associates this trait blatantly as nominally male , and I felt I was viewed as less qualified because of it. This story describes only one feeling among many that surfaced this summer. I cannot discount the role my supportive team members played in the successes of my projects that summer, but the extreme attention I placed on crafting my demeanor was certainly strategic, too, because I knew I walked a fine line between authority and respect at the workplace. After experiencing firsthand the sheer amount of male domination in industry, I couldn’t help but feel a desire to leave the field. In my second year of graduate school, I still needed more senior and successful female STEM professional role models. To stay and battle centuries’ worth of disadvantages seemed a dismal prospect from the standpoint of my novice career. To exit STEM and be considered as “adding to the problem”, or to stay and suffer the unequal treatment — there was no choice I could make to win. Such a quandary begs the question: What can our society do to effectively increase the number of women in STEM fields, despitestatisticsthat continue to reflect the problem of unequal representation, even as companies and institutions modify internal policies? We need the answer now more than ever. Rebecca Wang 22 is one of Vol. 260 s columnists for the Opinions section. She is a graduate student studying aeronautical & astronautical engineering.

rice_thresher_2022_31,"ByReginald DesRoches8/23/22 9:18pm This is my first column for the Thresher as Rice’s new president, and the opportunity fills me with a sense of awe and gratitude. Rice is a remarkable institution of higher education, and I am honored to lead and serve our community. To begin, my wife Paula and I want to welcome our new and transfer students to Rice. We are so glad that you chose Rice for your education and enjoyed meeting many of you during the move-in and welcome dinners last week. I also want to welcome back our returning Owls. It’s been great to see you again around campus! If Orientation Week is any indication, the fall and spring semesters are going to be filled with renewed energy and hope for a bright future. The students I met while moving into their residential colleges are full of excitement, ideas, hopes and dreams. They also are dedicated to investing in their futures and in Rice. This fall’s entering class is one of the largest ever — thanks to a growing student population and a more normal university environment as we continue to monitor and adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus poses a different challenge today than it did more than two years ago. We now have vaccines and treatments to combat the effects of COVID-19, and we have a better understanding of how we can protect ourselves with simple precautions like wearing masks in certain public settings when needed. Being responsible for your own health and respectful of other people’s health is especially important with the emergence of other viruses, such as Monkeypox. As I mentioned, the Class of 2026 is 1,210 new Owls strong. The class has no single ethnic or racial majority — 32% are from underrepresented minority groups and another 14% are international students who hail from 55 countries around the world. Our faculty, which is also growing, is becoming more reflective of our diverse community as well. The last two classes of new faculty members were among the most diverse ever at Rice. We continue to work hard in this area. I have only been in my role as president for about a month and a half. Much of my time thus far has been focused on assembling the university’s leadership team. I have announced several new members of the administration and am thrilled with the talent we have been able to recruit to Rice and the collaborative spirit and energy they all bring to their roles. The new members of the leadership team include: Provost Amy Dittmar, Vice President for Innovation Paul Cherukuri, Vice President for Finance and Administration Kelly Fox, Vice President for Research Ramamoorthy Ramesh and General Counsel Omar Syed. This group of new leaders — working closely with the vice provosts, other vice presidents, deans, chairs and institute directors — will work with me and others across campus to define and carry out some of my top goals, which include improving the student experience, and enabling Rice to reach a new level of distinction nationally and internationally for impactful scholarship, research and innovation. I also want to grow and elevate Rice’s graduate programs to the same distinction as our undergraduate programs, enhance our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, and expand our general education curriculum and study abroad program. We have made great strides in many of these areas in recent years, and I know this great community will keep up the momentum and take us further. I will continue the listening tour I started shortly after my announcement as president, with the goal of meeting as many staff, faculty and students as possible to hear about their hopes, concerns and aspirations for Rice. I look forward to visiting with you and wish everyone a fulfilling semester. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_35,"“Jin, jiyan, azadi!” From a young age, Kurdish women like myself are introduced to this powerful phrase, which translates to “women, life, freedom.” Our families teach us that this phrase is an integral part of the liberation struggle against the powers that occupy us, coined by Kurdish resistance fighters of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. They teach us that we, too, are a part of the movement for our homeland; for women, life, and freedom. In the past month, we’ve heard people repeat “zan, zendegi, azadi,” the Farsi translation of this phrase. I see people emphasizing solidarity with “Iranian women,” to fight for “freedom for Iran,” and to honor “Mahsa” Amini. While I will always join Iranians in standing against this regime, I can’t help but feel anger and resentment towards the erasure of Kurdish voices in this movement. After the death of Jina Amini, I immediately thought of my own mother, who experienced the same injustices Kurdish women still face in Iran today. After surviving the 1988 Halabja massacre in the Iraqi state, she fled to Iran, where she lived for three years. Unlike Jina, however, she survived the oppression and violence that the Iranian regime inflicted, and continues to inflict, on Kurds. Jina Amini, who was just 22 years old, was from the city of Saqqez in the Kurdistan province, the same city where the protests after her death first erupted. The city where Kurds continued to chant “women, life, freedom” as they have been for decades. Kurds have constantly echoed this phrase, but people finally joined us only after the Kurds of Saqqez screamed it in pain in the wake of Jina’s death. To see this revolutionary phrase co-opted into Farsi without the acknowledgment of Jina’s Kurdish identity and its implications for her death is devastating. This phrase, the phrase I grew up with, the phrase that helped me reconnect with my Kurdish heritage, was taken away from me – from us. Many people had never heard of “women, life, freedom” until they saw it in Farsi, in headlines as part of the movement “for Iranian women.” Under the Iranian regime, Kurdish names are banned. “Mahsa” was known to her family, friends, and community as Jina. Jina, the same name her mother repeated before her grave. Like many Kurdish women across our homelands, Jina often wore jili Kurdi (traditional Kurdish clothes . Like me, she heard Sorani Kurdish in her house. She, too, was familiar with the vibrant colors of the Kurdistan flag, a daughter of the sun. Jina’s Kurdish identity was not irrelevant to her death. It is more than likely that the morality police knew that Jina was Kurdish whenher brother allegedly pleaded with the police, telling them that they were not from Tehran, that they were just visitors. Iranian identification cards include postal codes, which indicate the province the detained person is from. Jina was from the Kurdistan Province of Iran. Kurds make up only 10 percent of the Iranian population, yet in 2019 constitutednearly halfof the political prisoner population in Iran. The Iranian regime has focused its attacks on predominantly Kurdish areas as well as other ethnic minority regions such as Balochistan. Iranian forces have gone so far as to attack military bases in the Kurdistan region of Northern Iraq for their uprisings against the Iranian regime. Yet, we only hear about the bravery and resilience of “Iranian” people. Now, more than ever, is the time to stand in solidarity with Kurdish women fighting for independence not only in Iran, but all four occupied parts of Kurdistan. The people of Iran will never see a world free of this violent regime until the people of Kurdistan are able to freely walk our lands. This world would have allowed a young 22-year-old girl to walk the streets of her beloved Kurdistan while people greet her as Jina. Our liberation is shared. Not only should we stand with Iranian protesters, but we should stand with Kurds, who are at the forefront of this movement. Jina Amini was a Kurdish woman; call her such. Call her by her real name, not the one imposed on her by the regime. Realize the history behind the phrase “women, life, freedom,” and start chanting it in the language of the women who coined it. The language that I grew up hearing in my house, just as Jina did in hers. As a Kurdish woman on this campus, I have felt the erasure and exclusion of Kurdish voices from this movement, both intentional and unintentional. Likewise, I have seen the power of uplifting Kurdish voices, whether at the protest in front of Widener or the die-in at the John Harvard statue. However, there is so much work to be done: changing our rhetoric, asking President Bacow to express solidarity with both Iranian and Kurdish women, to chant “jin, jiyan, azadi,” and no longer using Jina Amini’s regime name in conversations and demonstrations on campus. When you continue to march in the streets in solidarity with protesters in Kurdistan and Iran, when you post on social media, when you have conversations about what is happening, include the brave Kurds who made this movement possible. Include the women who continue to defend their homeland despite countless attempts at censorship and ethnic cleansing. Stand with Kurdish women. One day, Kurds like Jina, in a safe and free Kurdistan, will continue to chant the phrase that we all should remember. Jin, jiyan, azadi. Dalal Hassane ’26 lives in Matthews Hall."
state_press_2022_45,"ASU s campus is surrounded by bars and other drinking based establishments, despite being a dry campus. When I think of college students, I think of a few things: sober living, responsible choices and monogamy. That’s whyIchose Arizona State University. It makes complete sense that the University would dictate adry campus. Banning something entirely has always worked. We all know that’s why the prohibition worked so well. Sure, there are plenty of liquor stores and bars on University Drive, but we college students avoid those because we’re usually out drinking SunnyD and playing hopscotch. I have no clue which liquor stores don’t ID around here. Don’t ask me, because I don’t know. None of us know. We don’t drink, remember? Alcohol who? This policy is especially effective in off-campus housing options. The fraternity houses on our makeshift Greek Row are as dry as a sober living complex. Just last weekend I saw a cop bust a party for having too much fun playing Just Dance and braiding each other’s hair. And the best part of this dry campus policy? The numbers prove it works. According toa pollconducted by the University, 47.2% of ASU students do not drink alcohol, and 80.6% of ASU students do not use cannabis. We all answered that poll honestly, especially because the survey was conducted by the very University we pay to attend. But Claire,” you say, “The poll is anonymous! There’s no incentive to lie!” And to that, I say: Is anything actually anonymous anymore? We live in the era of sticky notes over web cameras, nobody is going to self-report their alcohol use to a school. Do you actually think any one of us is telling the truth? Sure, Michael Crow, 47.2% of students don t drink any alcohol on campus … whatever helps you sleep at night. Maybe college students aren’t interested in the party lifestyle anymore – perhaps they’ve seen the effects of addiction and are making a more responsible choice. Or maybe, just maybe, they’re lying. I don’t blame them, though. Addiction affects nearly 19.3 million individuals in America alone. It’s no wonder all we can do is churn out tiny alcoholics – they even sell onesies with the words “Beer Me.” Are we still going to pretend this whole “dry campus” thing is working? Thatcop from earlierhad to babysit a frat house while drunk kids stumbled on the front lawn. And although 80% of ASU students say they don’t smoke marijuana, 86.8% believe everyone else smokes without them. I don’t want to be too presumptuous, but I think they’re projecting a little. Numbers don’t lie, so somebody is smoking weed somewhere. We’ve been debating this since the nineties, and yet it seems we’ve gotten nowhere. ASU is a dry campus and sometimes a wet campus – whatever makes more money. Get caught with a bottle of vodka in the room? You’re done for. But build apubon campus? That’s fine, apparently. Let’s be honest, you can’t ban rowdy groups of young men who are living off-campus from buying booze. That’s simply an impossible task. You might as well be Sisyphus, rolling a rock up a hill. Astudyfrom the U.S. Department of Justice shows that a “dry campus” can only be so effective, and despite what I said earlier, the prohibition wasn’t actually very successful. That’s sort of why we have alcohol now. It’s time to look around and finally stare the problem in the face because right now some students are quietly developing addiction on a campus that won’t let them open up about it. Like literally every problem ever, the answer isn’t complete suppression. That’s what birthed Al Capone and coat hanger abortions. The University needs to stop touting questionable statistics and willful ignorance, and look around and see the quiet industry operating beneath it. Because, believe it or not, most people don’t braid hair at frat parties. Edited by Sadie Buggle, Wyatt Myskow, Greta Forslund and Kristen Apolline Castillo.

crimson_2022_130,"When I was looking through courses this semester, I noticed that the professor of a class about narratives of individuals who were enslaved was a white man. That didn’t sit right with me. Why would a class about stories integral to Black culture be taught by someone with no lived experience in that culture? I’ll back up a little bit. As a straight, cisgender, white man from an upper-middle-class family, I come from an awful lot of privilege. I know how easy it is to unintentionally overlook bigotry because it doesn’t constantly exert a force on my life. I’ve felt the effects of discrimination through my friends and my mom, who works as a lawyer, while my dad stays home — but that’s not remotely the same. And as someone with not just one, but many forms of privilege, I haven’t had any experience with oppression that might help me empathize with others’ struggles. I simply have no rubric. This lack of lived experience means I have to be careful when talking about injustice. I can, and should, educate myself on the topic — oppressed people shouldn’t bear the sole responsibility of teaching others about their trauma. But there’s a difference between forcing the burden of education on victims and understanding that a story rooted in group history and experience can only be truly told by someone within that group. So regardless of how qualified white professors are, I really don’t think they should be teaching classes explicitly focused on the experiences of other racial or ethnic groups. Of course, these topics need to be taught, and at a less-well-funded school, a white teacher might be the only person available. But Harvard has the resources to hire whomever they like, so it’s concerning that 79 percent of tenured professors are white, 57 percent are white men, and only 4 percent are Black. Yale and Princeton, among others, have similar demographics, but that should not be used to diffuse responsibility. Something is deeply broken. Harvard should hire more minority faculty in every department — diverse scholars shouldn’t be pigeonholed into studying only their own cultural history. But in fields focused on group culture, there’s no excuse for underrepresentation. While there are certainly esteemed Black professors in the Department of African and African American Studies, there are not nearly enough. And that’s not for lack of demand — students have been pushing for an expanded ethnic studies program foryears. Why such reticence to make meaningful change? One reason is that this change requires privileged individuals to fight against their own privilege. And that’s hard, because privilege offers a powerful feeling of superiority — a feeling strong enough to cause people to sometimes betray solidarity even when it would be in their economic interest. Poor white Southerners, for instance, refused to join Black sharecroppers after the Civil War to fight the plantation aristocracy, because they didn’t want to let go of the emotional safety net of white supremacy. Fear of ostracization offers another impetus to stay silent — for example, men who stand up for women’s rights are often attacked by other men. And hearing marginalized people speak up can feel like injustice for those accustomed to their stories being the only ones told. That’s why white racists scream “reverse racism,” and transphobes cry for the rights of the “super-straights.” Whether I like it or not, my privilege gives me a platform, and I have a responsibility to use it, because silence promotes the status quo. As I understand it, I should amplify others’ stories, express my opposition to discrimination, and share my experience when appropriate. It’s a cop-out to argue that I shouldn’t say anything because my perspective isn’t as relevant as the one of the person who’s experiencing discrimination; telling my story isn’t mutually exclusive with listening as long as I’m respectful. I just need to make sure I stay open to constructive criticism — I have no experience with the other side of the power dynamic, so criticism could easily be rightful. Of course, being an ally does not absolve me of privilege — I know that I’m still capable of accidentally hurting people, and judgment for going against the grain is not the same as being seen as subhuman. I’m also aware that I shouldn’t congratulate myself for standing up — applauding allies for decrying bigotry, while not doing the same for marginalized people, is itself a subtle form of discrimination. I shouldn’t be rewarded twice as much for working half as hard. I’m sure the white professors teaching about Black history are knowledgeable. But that doesn’t mean they should be the ones teaching those classes. As someone who’s never faced discrimination, I ask those in my position to understand our shared lack of experience, and therefore to be more cognizant of when to talk and when to shut up — even when it’s easy to keep talking. Because the only people who can truly understand prejudice are those who have been on the wrong side of it. There are many things I can and should do with the platform my privilege affords me. Telling someone else’s story for them is not one of those things. Ian D. Svetkey ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Hurlbut Hall."
thetech_mit_2022_10,"I came to MIT excited for an excellent graduate education in Materials Science and Engineering. After my first few weeks, it became clear to me that much of the work of crafting an education for both graduate and undergraduate students fell to the TAs. They were responsible for attending lectures, drafting problem sets in advance, teaching multiple recitation sessions each week, preparing review sessions, holding office hours, updating and configuring Canvas, drafting exam questions, proctoring exams, and grading problem sets, term papers, and exams. They do all of this while still being expected to conduct world-class research and take onmany additional administrative and maintenance tasks. Under the current system, faced with a massive workload and limited by time, TAs have two choices: 1 work very long hours to make sure students have the information and practice they need to be successful in the course, while also continuing research for their thesis, or 2 maintain a healthy work-life balance and keep a normal work schedule, but give fewer resources and less help to students, and be less productive with research. Much thought has already been given to how graduate students could win comprehensivemental health, vision, and dental care;more affordable housing options;protections for international students; andfair working conditions for researchersthrough unionization. However, education should not be overlooked. Through unionization, graduate students would have collective bargaining power to negotiate more support for TAs and ensure students, both graduate and undergraduate, receive a world-class education to match MIT’s impressive reputation. After arriving at MIT, eager to tackle my first classes as a graduate student, I began to struggle to apply broad lecture concepts in practice. I stared at the homework with no clue how to begin despite having a good grasp of the material from the lectures. I found that problem sets were often created years ago and recycled despite there being massive changes to the course curriculum and faculty teaching the course. Repeatedly, definitions and concepts differed between lectures and problem sets, causing massive confusion since they were all still so new to me. While I hoped that recitations would clear things up and give some much-needed example problems, we had only an hour to cover a few problems out of the dozens I was supposed to learn, practice, and master. Professors rarely wrote the problems themselves, and as a result, the practice rarely prepared me for the exams. My TAs did try to help bridge the gap by holding extra office hours, and although they all wanted me to succeed, many didn’t have enough time to devote to teaching while simultaneously conducting quality research. Some TAs weren’t able to attend lectures, review or modify recycled problem sets, upload solutions consistently, or finish grading exams and homework before the next problem set or exam. But addressing all of these issues that hinder student learning would take an incredible amount of time — time TAs certainly don’t have! TAs face the unfair conundrum of whether to prioritize being good teachers and researchers or working extremely long hours to attempt both with limited success.Some students TA because they need funding, to complete a course requirement for a minor, or because they were involuntarily assigned the position by a department in need of more teaching staff. Still, some do it because they genuinely really enjoy teaching. Whatever their reason for becoming a TA, they face a massive challenge with relatively little support. While many professors are trying to juggle myriad other responsibilities such as advising students on their research, traveling for conferences, writing textbooks or papers, serving on committees, and securing funding, they are often unaware of or fail to address these issues and stresses placed on TAs. While most professors care deeply for their students and many have a passion for teaching, the system for higher education is designed to put teaching second to research. For many professors, research — what brings in funding and determines their prospect for tenure — is their highest priority. And because TAs are put in a difficult situation where teaching may not be their first priority either, students get the short end of the stick. With the power of solidarity in a union, we could tweak the system to make it much easier for professors and TAs to prioritize providing a quality education to their students. With a union contract, we can negotiate with MIT to define a clear job description and work expectations for TAs and guarantee certain learning standards for students. We can set guidelines for what TAs need from professors to provide the best support and education they can, and what students need from TAs and professors so they get more from their courses and have more time for their research. What TAs need from professors: A clear, fair definition of the number of hours they are to spend on TA duties per week (see for example theUniversity of Californiagraduate union contract . TA bonuses such as those won by graduate student unions at other universities. (Tuftswon $1,000 per course for graduate student-worker TAs after their first course. Access to all previous years’ problem sets, textbooks, supplementary reading materials, exams, answer keys, and lecture slides. (Some graduate union contracts guarantee access to required instructional materials — see for example theUniversity of Michigan. A calendar outlining the dates and times for recitations, problem set submission deadlines, and exams. Professor oversight, review, and yearly approval of all problem sets, recitation problems, and exams. Access to previous years’ anonymous course evaluations (including written feedback and ratings . Clear, quantitative grading criteria for exams, problem sets, and projects (a rubric would be best . A guarantee of adequate TA trainings before being hired or the first day of class (see for example theUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigngraduate employee organization contract . What students need from TAs and professors: Access to previous year’s course evaluations and a detailed list of concept prerequisites in the description of each course in the course catalog. A calendar outlining the dates and times for recitations, problem set submission deadlines, and exams. Timely access to lecture slides, supplementary materials, and answer keys. Timely grades and feedback on problem sets and exams, prior to the next exam or assignment. Review sessions and/or materials before each exam. Clear, written expectations of learning outcomes and objectives from each lecture or unit between exams. When graduate workers receive the support they need as TAs, they are better able to meet these central needs of students.We need to remember that we all have the same goals here at MIT: to receive a quality education, provide fabulous teaching, and do cutting-edge research.Using our collective power to negotiate for improvements that help TAs will in turn benefit students’ learning experience and help professors deliver quality teaching. By voting yes on unionization, graduate students can further the goals of MIT."
stanforddaily_2022_49,"Jack Golub graduated Stanford in 2020. He now teaches English in Austin, Texas. Dear Classes of 2020 and 2021 (and perhaps even 2022 , I left Stanford and became a teacher. My school is pretty different from Stanford, though. A lot of the students never pay attention. Our principal is a bit, uh, robotic. We don’t treat our custodial staff as an integral part of our school community… Alright, perhaps not as different as I thought. In all seriousness, Stanford is different. At Stanford, I struggled. I often felt listless and confused. Spring quarter I’d usually get a little depressed. I guess getting drunk at 11 a.m. just didn’t do it for me. But I felt loved. I felt loved and supported by my peers, right from the start. My frosh year, half the dorm tried to help me learn CS106A. That they failed is irrelevant. My junior year, as an RA, I was down bad at times. My friends reached out to me. They came to see me. They listened, even when I had nothing to say. At Stanford, I felt confident that the people around me had my back. I knew my administration had the resources to provide me with an unparalleled education, including a daily menu of rich cultural events. I largely felt that my Stanford journey lived up to our motto, “let the winds of freedom blow.” I was given a gift that let me grow. Not everyone gets that gift. I currently teach seventh grade in Austin, Texas. I chose to teach because I thought I could connect deeply with students and uncover, for them to see, a surprisingly vast potential. Uvalde sits only a couple hours away from my school. Since May 24, grief and anger have stolen my thoughts. I have felt lost. I cried in front of my students as I lied to them, telling them that I would protect them no matter what, all while knowing that my body won’t beat an AR-15. I have felt small. I needed to remind myself that we, recent and new Stanford graduates, stand on the shoulders of giants. We stand on the shoulders of the strong and loving Muwekma Ohlone tribe, a people who have survived and continue to survive colonialism and white supremacy. They are capable of such strength that they continue to love this sacred land, where they have lived for thousands of years, at every cost. We stand with conviction on the shoulders of bell hooks, whose fierce voice for justice still resonates in her absence. We stand expressively, and yes, securely, on the shoulders of Issa Rae. We stand in all-white Air-Force 1s on the shoulders of Phil Knight. We stand thousands of miles beyond earth on the shoulders of Mae Jemison and Sally Ride. We stand on the physically less imposing yet altogether revolutionary shoulders of Sergey Brin and Larry Page. We stand bravely, ready to speak truth to power, on the shoulders of Christine Blasey Ford. We stand on the shoulders of Stanford luminaries. Shoulders that are daunting in their size and, sometimes, in their shortcomings. To recognize how big we are, we must acknowledge both. We stand on the shoulders of the first president of Stanford, David Starr Jordan: pioneering psychologist, strategic president and prominent eugenicist. We stand on Leland Stanford’s shoulders. Our founder who was ahead of his time in creating a coed school loosened from some constraints of established gender norms. He built this school with money made from exploiting Chinese railroad workers. We have been poured into by our families and this school. Our teachers in the front of the room, our teachers sitting alongside us, our teachers serving us food, our teachers cleaning our bathrooms and those teachers calling us, asking when next are we coming home. 2020 and 2021, we stand here, now, at the perfect time. We are not eager to burst forth, filled with passion and optimism, onto a broken world awaiting our leadership. We are not looking ahead to what doors this Stanford degree will open for us in the future. This is the future. We are already here. We have learned that those doors won’t magically open. Sometimes, the task of taking care of ourselves is more than enough for one day. The amazing future of fulfillment and powerful change that we normally would be promised during this weekend has, for many of us, not quite arrived on time. Maybe it got stuck in the Tresidder mail office. The line looks long, and I don’t have my ID card anymore. So, I won’t pretend that our good intentions and intelligence are enough. I won’t ask for a moment of silence so that we can acknowledge our grief and then move on. The change we desperately need in the world won’t happen until we change ourselves. Until we realize, collectively, that we have been given a gift that can never be earned or repaid. We stand so high, on such grand and great shoulders, such flawed shoulders, that we cannot come down. We are here to stay. Whatever we do with the power of our knowledge and our relationships furthers the legacy of this school. For better or for worse. Some of us have already begun honoring this gift. Since March 2020, we have learned of the courageous and creative capacities we hold within. When Stanford abruptly kicked us off campus we instinctively thought of others. We built a robust mutual aid network in mere days. One of us mobilized neighborhood helpers to deliver groceries to those that couldn’t get them, literally feeding the hungry. Another assembled a team across the country to design and sell clothing and use the proceeds to buy crucial baby care items that parents and foster parents could not afford. Others of us served in less visible ways. We took care of, even homeschooled younger siblings. We helped family members and friends leave dangerous relationships and battle sickness. We started therapy to become better at loving one another, at loving ourselves. We survived after losing people dear to us. Finally, and this is true, one of us quit Goldman Sachs after only four weeks on the job. The time to change our expectations of ourselves is not today. This whole weekend is the time to remember and celebrate and give thanks. To remember late nights in the lounge. The shock, which turned to thrill, then eventually irritation at roll outs. The relief at finishing finals followed by the bumbling camaraderie of Nomad. The randomly sunny, 80-degree winter days spent lounging, spike balling and pretending to do work. Those two weeks in 2017 where everyone simultaneously discovered Polo y Pan. The amazement of our first time at Gaieties. The, for some of us, sloppier enjoyment of all the other Gaieties. And, for a few of us, our naked prancing across the stage of our final Gaieties. To celebrate that we did something difficult together. The challenges we overcame — all those late nights in Green Library working on p-sets (I actually can’t relate to that one; thank you, humanities , speakers antagonizing us yearly with their false narratives of Christian nationalism, COVID. The moments of triumph — the band getting un-banned, securing pay raises for student staff, that moment during every Common Origins performance where all five hundred members are on stage at once and you’re thinking to yourself, “How is this possible?” To give thanks that the frantic hallway goodbyes of March 2020 were not permanent. Thanks for the teachers and other staff who believed in us and challenged us in equal measure. For our frosh communities. For the creative writing classes that make everyone who takes them feel like we have something important to share. For the glorious culmination of fellowship that we call Special D. For the relentless student activists who showed us how bright our inner lights can shine in moments of crisis. Today is the time to remind ourselves of the gift we have received. Tomorrow is the time to change. To do the uncomfortable, setback-ridden work of loving one another more. To push our professional efforts, no matter what we do and especially if it seems unrelated to our society’s challenges, closer towards justice. To stay humble and continue to fulfill this tremendously powerful gift. Tomorrow, and every day after it, is the time to use that gift. I hope that one of my students makes it into Stanford. If they do, I believe they will stand on even sturdier and stronger shoulders. The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor. We’d love to hear your thoughts.

crimson_2022_62,"Bringing another soul into what often feels like acruel worldis one of the most dangerous events for women —especiallythe Black ones. What emerges from the birth canal of the Black woman is not only the miracle of life, but also an extension of the psychic, emotional, and physical reflections of what it means to be breathing while Black. Alongside her suckling infant she gives birth to new-born fears for what will follow her innocent child everywhere — from the streets to thehospitals, to theclassroom, to thejail cell, and beyond. And through mother’s milk passes not only stem cells and antibodies, but also an acute awareness of an actively anti-Black world. Sometimes I lay awake at night and think of the things I will pass to my future Black child, and it is then that I am reminded that in conjunction with triumph, tragedy, and all things in between, one in three children that I might give life to from my Black uterus will likely get the opportunity to walk the paths of Harvard Yard as a college student someday. And while there are many a tragic legacy the world may attempt to impose onto my child’s life, it’s ironically safe to say that this is not one. I guess what I’m saying is: I take no issue with the Harvard legacy that will come from my womb. Legacy admissions at Harvard is in many respects anunjust practicethat primarily serves the privileged. Plainly put, it is a symptom of the white supremacist undergirds of higher education — because in the practice of uplifting the privileged, those left at a disadvantage are often the ones who identify as part of minority, low-income, and first-generation populations. This critical perspective on legacy admissions fundamentally — and rightfully — denounces the winners and weaves a narrative from the threads of seemingly clear-cut, progressive, equitable ideas. Nevertheless, it is a presentist, reductionist narrative with built-in erasure of some of the very same demographics we argue deserve more visibility. Because the reality is, histories and legacies are complex — and they warrant a nuanced perspective on the fact that although we must be aware of where tools of oppression are at work, for many, idealizing a disdain for legacy admissions is not quite so simple. My future Black child will bring with them more than my (by then, decades-old Harvard degree to a college application. That one in three chance at a “second-look” from a Harvard admissions counselor is accompanied by my daughter’s four in 10 chance of experiencing intimate partner violence, my son’s one in 1,000 chance at being killed at the hands of police, and my queer child’s at least four in five chance at facing negative physical, spiritual, and psychological effects on their wellbeing — odds not easily able to be written off as some unfair advantage at walking through the world. From conception, I’ll fear that my Black son cannot go for arun, my Black daughtercannot restpeacefully in her bed at home, and my Black, queer child may fall victim to a heinoushate crime. It is excruciatingly clear that some of the legacies that will follow my children are not the same as those of their white peers. The truth is that the world at once robbed me of a safe and easy ignorance, thrusting me into a mode of consciousness that permeates everything in life, from walking down the street to choosing classes, friends, andfuture careers. And the unfortunate reality of the ongoing social dynamic in which we live is that by measures beyond my control, the world will likely rob the freeing simplicity of some things in life from my child too. To breathe while Black — to be while Black — is not simple. The politics of inheritance are not without complexity, and are certainly not lost on us. It is something Black people know all too well, and often not from the winning side. So while Beyoncé gave her daughter aGrammy, I’ll settle for giving mine a one in three chance to study at one of the world’s premier institutions — because most stats already aren’t in her favor. I will fight like hell to leave my children legacies of love and resistance to balance out all of what I unfortunately know will follow them throughout the course of their lives. I will dedicate my life to creating the most equitable and safe world to bring them into. At the very least, if I can’t flip this anti-Black world on its head in my lifetime, I know I can give them a 33 percent chance to not just get in the door at a place like Harvard, but to make sure they stay in the building with the lights on and bills paid after they’ve crossed the threshold — especially considering that we were barred from entering the College gates for longer than we’ve been allowed inside them. I’m giving them an added possibility — if they want it — to raise questions about society and why it can’t be what we dream it to be, to participate in the continued shaping of thecommunity, to fight fora conscious pedagogical ambition, and to open more doors behind them after they go. And hopefully some of the dreams occupying their nights need not reflect entirely the nightmares of my own. Kyla N.

rice_thresher_2022_66,"ByCole Holladay1/18/22 11:04pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. As is the case with most aspects of our reality, professionalism and academia have been defined by whiteness to a degree that is obvious in their customs, codifications and subtleties.Whitenessis often defined as a latent, systemic ideology in which the customs of the white majority are normalized to a degree that alienates others, sometimes unbeknownst to the white people benefiting from it. Over time, white majorities have established a monopoly on communication, prioritizing their culture-specific vernaculars and language structure, thus creating norms of communication. Through the expansion of this construct, marginalized communities have been actively excluded from academic and professional spaces institutionalized by whiteness. Our university falls into this category. The First-year Writing Intensive Seminar program’s curriculum exemplifies this reality. In light of the necessities that are diversity and inclusion in an educational environment, our community must have more conversations about the inequities woven into the university’s approach to academic writing. For example, upon taking Rice’s diagnostic composition examination over the summer, we are assigned into groups based on our ability in “academic writing.” This begs the question, what constitutes successful academic writing? Is it possible that biases and standards of whiteness influence the “ideal” form of written communication and delegitimize other cultures? In 2017, the Director of the University of Washington Tacoma’s Writing Center, Dr. Asao Inoue, asked himself these questions. During his tenure as director,Inoue used his roleto confront exclusive conventions of writing and prioritize “rhetorical situations” in Writing Center programming. Underlying this goal was the recognition that enforcing abstract grammatical correctness excludes many students. In practice, the writing center manipulated the definition of academic and professional writing in the context of a diverse student body to validate individual identities and foster unique expression. This mission was exhibited through the Center’s efforts to academically legitimize African American Vernacular English, the exploration of discrimination based on language expression in grading, and the acknowledgment that conforming to existing language conventions is achoice. The Program in Writing and Communication’s website states their goal of teaching students to “communicate correctly” through the FWIS program. Considering the integral importance of language, dialect and vernacular to cultural identity, the expectation that students of different backgrounds should express themselves uniformly inherently contradicts inclusivity and can, instead, reward conformity. The implications of grammatical correctness and particular expression of ideas through the standardization of writing can eventually lead to the suppression of diversity and identity. As opposed to bridging gaps between students, alternatively, FWIS classes should put a higher value on the wide range of differences between students and their backgrounds to cultivate a culture of learning from each other. The shifting mission of UW Tacoma’s Writing Center should serve as a meaningful guide to this sensitivity, disenfranchising the long-held ideas of what qualifies as professional or academic. Therefore, empowering students of all backgrounds so that they have the skills to express themselves in an impactful way while maintaining their individualism. I hope that students, professors and the university alike will further acknowledge and evaluate the structural unfairness of academic writing and grammatical conventions, supporting the institutionalization and development of productive and inclusive alternatives. As a community, we should shift our understanding of valuable contributions from their ability to communicatively conform to their uniqueness and unconventionality. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_167,"Dear first-years, As you begin your first few weeks at Harvard, you will undoubtedly hear hollow speeches from our administration. They will tell you that the next four years of your lives will be a transformative experience and that you’ll all go on to be world-changers. These speeches usually end with a call to live up to our motto, Veritas, to search for “the truth.” That is, of course, as long as this truth doesn’t upset the status quo. Because when truth demands change, it is swept under the carpet — and Harvard is no exception. What the administration is not going to tell you is that Harvard is designed to maintain the status quo when it comes to social change and justice. They prefer incremental but inconsequential reforms that let you give yourself a pat on the back. You will distract yourself with snobbish discussions in dining halls about political and social theory so you never end up confronting the real question: Am I actually bringing this world closer to freedom and justice? Is our institution, an infamous pipeline to finance and consulting, genuinely helping? Some people at Harvard will argue that they don’t know much about politics. Others will tell you that they don’t get involved because they don’t want to upset anyone. Then there s the cherry on top of social ignorance: “It’s too controversial.” As Harvard students, we are already immensely privileged, but these hesitant excuses to remove ourselves highlight a deafening indifference to the reality we live in. Marginalized and targeted communities around the world do not have the choice to be ignorant of politics: They are born into politics and must endure it on a near daily basis. The cold reality is that in order to change oppressive and systemically violent systems, you have to upset powerful institutions. Why? Because these institutions, Harvard included, have benefitted and still benefit economically and politically from the subjugation of others. If you really start to push, Harvard knows there are real stakes on the line: its money and power. Apologies for bursting the everyone-hold-hands-in-harmony bubble, but the poisonous narrative of “respect everyone’s opinions” breeds political passivity. I can already hear apologists beg marginalized groups to stop being angry and relax — to call for everyone to be friends and love one another. But the reality is that administrations who claim to fearlessly pursue truth only promote stale dialogues. Student activists argue that the prison-industrial complex maintains a systemically violent, racist state and demands divestment. The administration gets up and says that Harvard should not use its endowment to “achieve political ends, or particular ends.” (I, for one, think it should be blatantly obvious that making money from private prisons is already political. Then, the moderator thanks everyone for sharing. Everyone goes home. Nothing changes. Student activists demand divestment from the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine and the imposition of anapartheid regimethere. The complicit administration repeats their spineless position that endorsing “individual or particular positions on these issues do not encourage debate;they actually quash it,” despite bragging about alumni who put their lives on the line for the sole purpose of social change. The moderator thanks everyone for sharing. Everyone goes home. The apartheid regime stands untouched. Unlike our discussions in seminar classes, groups living under the boot of oppressive regimes do not have the luxury of listening to the other side, forgetting about it, then going back to their daily lives. Opinions have consequences in the real world, so let’s stop fooling ourselves by insisting that “respecting everyone’s opinions” is a virtuous position to take — it rings hollow. No Harvard administration has ever been the driving force for real change and social justice. The real force comes from grassroots organizations. They are the ones who push the administration and cause discomfort until it finally heeds the call for justice. By all means, Harvard’s sweet-talk tries hard to convince us otherwise. The facade is crystal clean and well-manicured — no doubt the result of a very clever marketing team — but the inside is more sinister. We hear our deans talk of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” and we think to ourselves, “Wow these people really must be the pioneers of progressivism!” But I don’t buy it and you shouldn’t either. How can an administration talk about inclusion and justice when they refuse to publicly commit to divest from private prisons and have investments in companies complicit in Israel’s apartheid regime? So what should you do? Find the divest groups on campus (Palestine Solidarity Committee, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, Stop Harvard Land Grabs and start organizing. Push the people around you by talking about real issues. Elevate the voices on campus who are calling for justice. Put your feet on the ground when they organize a protest. Disrupt. Keep making noise until it grabs people’s attention. Make people uncomfortable until they can no longer turn a blind eye. Frankly, that’s the only way that change has or will ever come about. I’m not going to pretend that Harvard’s multiple divest campaigns would solve the world’s problems if they succeeded, but as the Crimson Editorial Board has said before regarding prison divestment, “The question is not where to stop, but rather where to begin”.Do you really want to look back when you’re older and think to yourself that you stayed silent while others spoke up? Teach yourself how to speak up, because Harvard won’t. If you really want to make a change, start organizing. Josh D.

state_press_2022_12,"Mold is one of the hazards that students have found in their rooms, the Hassayampa dorm is one place where students reported becoming ill. From news articles to word of mouth, it has become widely known there is a concern about mold in ASU housing. It seems as though the University is not taking enough precautionary measures to ensure student safety. On-campus students should have legal protection regarding housing, which would leave the University more accountable for student health concerns. The story gained attention from an ABC15 interview with a student s parents andtheir outcry for ASU to controlmold levels that allegedly made their daughter sick. With pictures and expert opinion, it seems fairly obvious that mold levels were growing over the minimum amount, according to Cheri Dersam, a physician atIntegrative Medicine of Arizonawho was interviewed by ABC15. MultipleRedditusers expressed the story told by the parents was not the only case of mold concerns. These complaints should not be taken lightly, especially considering people are skeptical of mold in Vista del Sol, Palo Verde West and Hassayampa. Ethan Long, a first-year student studying digital and integrated marketing communications, moved into the Hassayampa dorms in the fall. I was sick two days after moving in and on and off throughout the time I lived in the dorm full-time, he said. Both he and his roommate noticed an odd smell upon move-in, which has caused him to avoid on-campus living as much as possible. Although he has the ability to live off-campus with his parents, ASU housesmany internationaland out-of-state students who do not have the same opportunities. So, why isn t ASU truly doing anything about the issue? In a statement to ABC15, the University said it conducted an indoor environmental quality assessment in November 2021 concluding the air quality in the residence halls was normal. However, this did not match the test results from a urinalysis of the ill student in the article. Along with thisinvestigation, it was noted that (The city of Tempe Code Enforcement does not perform interior inspections on ASU property.ASU housing agreementsstate the relationship existing between students and University housing is that of licensor and licensee, and NOT that of landlord and tenant. The explicit statement of the licensor-licensee agreement suggests that there are different protections within this relationship that differ from a landlord-tenant relationship. ASU does not seem to have written regulation in placeto condemn the presence of mold in University housing. This seems very odd considering thatTempe apartmentshave had their fair share of mold concerns, so it is not uncommon in the area. From research and ASU spokespeople, it is unclear what rights students dohave in this licensor and licensee relationship. To make students feel secure, the University needs to accommodate on-campus residents with a written set of liabilities and protection rights, specifically regarding health. Since the start of the 2021 school year, ASU has found no evidence of significant mold growth in the ventilation system of any residential hall, an ASU spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ASU maintenance staff clean vents and replace air filters frequently throughout the year to help reduce dirt and dust in the air system. After asking questions regarding protections and inspections, the University gave no response and simply restated its case that mold should not be of concern. To me, this seems as though the University either has no protections in place or is trying to cover its back against civil suits and cases. Apart from mold, ASU s Downtown Phoenix campus hasresidents of Roosevelt Point reporting rat infestationsin the building. It is clear that the University is not keeping its housing up to reasonable health standards and needs to be making legal reforms for student safety and its own liability. ABOR has not yet publicly addressed the problem, and it is clear that even throughout the twomeetingsthat have already occurred in 2022, the Research and Health Sciences Committee does not even acknowledge the issue. Overall, ASU’s lack of acknowledgment of the mold affecting student health shows that the University would rather uphold its reputation than genuinely help the students.

thetech_mit_2022_47,"Dear MIT Graduate Student Union (MIT-GSU voters, Leading up to the certification vote for your graduate student union, we at the Harvard Graduate Student Union (HGSU wanted to share some of our experiences as a union, to help inform your decision. Unions are, at their core, workers joining together to collectively articulate and advocate for the rights, benefits, and dignity they want. While our union is only a few years old, we are proud to have created an organization where student workers coordinate to advance our common desire for a safe and productive working relationship with our University. We’re not full-time “activists” or “organizers” — we are all students enrolled in difficult and consuming programs, like you. But we organize together as a union because we recognize that we are not only students, but also studentworkerswho run courses, conduct world-class research, and devote countless hours to mentorship and scholarship. Without graduate student labor, how many of your labs and classrooms would run as well? We are proud that our work helps make our University what it is, and we are proud to have a collective voice to ensure that our efforts get appropriate recognition. We organize together because we know we often deserve better than thestatus quo. During the years we spend earning our degrees, we’re told to accept conditions and pay that leave most of us chronically stressed, trusting that eventually we’ll get cushy jobs where things will be better. But prestige and promises don’t pay the bills; we’re living our livesnow, not just preparing for our lives to begin — whether or not the cushy jobs ever materialize. We’re told to play nice when course heads and principal investigators (PIs bully or harass us or to accept that we’ll get paid when they get around to it at rates that, for many of us, fail to cover the cost of living. “Grad school is tough,” we’re told. But we know it doesn’t have to be this way. While you decide how to cast your ballot April 4–5, consider what unionizing has won us in just a few short years: Better pay.Before we had a contract, the University decided if we received raises any given year. Historically, they usually increased our pay in line with inflation, but in years of supposed economic austerity, they could choose to freeze our pay (as they did in2017and tried to do in 2021–22, citing pandemic-related concerns while boasting an$11.3 billion increase to the endowment in that same year . With a union and a contract,we now have a say in what we are paid.As a result, we got a 3% raise in 2020 while faculty took a pay freeze, and a 5% raise this year while the university tried to impose 2.8% on students they claimed were outside our agreement. Through our union organizing, we were also able to bring pay parity to an entire school of student workers: thanks to our contract negotiations, graduate researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health are no longer paid at two-thirds the rate of everybody else at Harvard while performing the same work. Benefits.We won benefit funds for copays, out-of-pocket and dental costs, dependent premiums, child care, and emergencies, putting approximately $500,000 in the pockets of student workers last year. In our recent contract battle, we won even greater funds, a total of $1.55 million for the first year, $2.15 million for the second year, and $2.75 million for the third and fourth years. Starting in September, for the first time in the history of the University, we will have dental insurance (75% premium coverage included in our health care plan.For many members,these benefit wins are life-changing. Job clarity, security, and materials.Before our contract, student workers often knew little of what was expected of them, even regarding their basic hours and responsibilities. Course heads and PIs could set unreasonably intense expectations, and there were no guardrails student workers could point to. Now, we receive appointment letters delineating expected tasks prior to starting work; guaranteed pay for cancelled job appointments and if workers leave a work environment because of harassment, discrimination, or abuse; workload limits; remote work accomodations; guaranteed work materials; and private workspaces. Rights forallmembers.Graduate school is difficult for everyone, but can be especially difficult for parents, people with disabilities, people of color, international students, low-income and first-generation students, women and nonbinary people, and others who don’t fit the historical mold of what a graduate student looks like. We have fought hard to mitigate the unequal treatment that often falls on these groups, and have won established protected categories in employment (including caste and class background in 2021 , reasonable accommodations for pregnant student workers and those with disabilities, funds ($30,000 per year for immigration expenses, guaranteed increases to stipends for births and adoptions ($7,000 per working parent, increasing 2.25% annually for the next three years , and sick and bereavement leave. We have also created working groups that have issued final recommendations for University-wide policies on Anti-Bullying (including power-based harassment and Non-Discrimination and Harassment — soon to be implemented to create thefirstUniversity-wide policies on these issues. A community that cares.Our union has brought together thousands of people committed to creating a fair and equitable workplace for student workers. One way we show up for one another is throughenforcing our rights and benefits via our grievance procedure. But more broadly, we have,for years now, shown up to fight alongside and for one another over hundreds of meetings, rallies, protests, polls, petitions, and direct actions. It hasn’t always been easy, and we still have lots to learn. But we know one thing:if you’re facing an issue in your workplace, a union provides you a concrete place to go where you will be met with support, care, and solutions. We know you may have heard a different story about our contract from MIT, so we encourage you to view the agreement in full (harvardgradunion.org/our-contract and judge it for yourself. Not all of our battles are finished — it turns out negotiating with a $53 billion institution takes more than one contract fight. Our fight forReal Recourse, in particular, has been met with disappointing resistance by a University not incentivized to hold tenured harassers and abusers accountable. We were able to secure a legal fund for survivors going through the Title IX process and guaranteed pay for researchers who leave a lab due to harassment or discrimination, but this is far from enough. Since ratifying our contract,we have continued to organize around Real Recourse, and it is at the forefront of our union’s current efforts. But our decision to ratify a contract without all our original demands is not proof that unions aren’t worth your time, as MIT admins would have you believe. It’s evidence that unions are democratic organizations whose goal is to empower workers to decide how and when to fight for what matters most to them, not to impose some external agenda. HGSU hosted a lively debate in daily email digests on whether to accept our most recent contract or to keep fighting for more, with union leaders and rank-and-file members arguing both sides of the issue. The decision to ratify the contract was then made by a democratic vote of our members, who judged for themselves whether the deal was good enough to accept — as you will be able to do with every future contract, if a majority of voters vote to certify MIT-GSU. Ultimately, the choice to unionize is yours. If we could go back in time, we’d do it again in a heartbeat, and we hope you make the same choice April 4–5. From up the river in solidarity, HGSU-UAW Local 5118 The HGSU Executive Board consists of President Koby Ljunggren, Vice President Amulya Mandava, Recording Secretary Tina Wei, Financial Secretary Steffan Paul, Guide Mark Wright, Sergeant-At-Arms Margaret Czerwienski, and Trustees Zeke Benshirim, Rachel Petherbridge, and Denish Jaswal."
thetech_mit_2022_0,"As someone who still retains a Russian passport and, more importantly, has a strong bond to Russian culture and the Russian people, I’m overwhelmed with grief, shame, and guilt. Reports from Ukraine — “Kyiv under siege,” “Konotop taken” — bring back thoughts of Hitler’s 1941 invasion, a not-so-distant past for my generation, whose parents and grandparents lived through that war. A song from that era keeps playing in my head: On the 22nd of Juneexactly at four in the morningKyiv was bombed,and we were toldthat the war has begun. The war started at dawnin order to kill more people.Asleep were parents,asleep were kidsin the morning when Kyiv was bombed. This war also started at dawn and is killing parents and kids in Kyiv and all over Ukraine. It is striking how closely Putin’s rhetoric parallels that of Hitler — just replace “nationalist gangs” (from which Putin wants to “free” Ukraine with “Judeo-Bolshevik gangs.” Regardless of how complex the situation in the Donbass region and the history of the NATO-Russia relationship might be, one thing is clear: what is happening now is a heinous crime on the part of Russia’s leadership. It may be tempting to say that I have never supported Putin and that this is his war, not that of the Russian people. Yet the sad reality is that Putin’s policies have been supported by large sectors of the Russian public, including some of my friends and extended family. Whether Putin’s supporters are in the majority is hard to judge in a country where dissent is increasingly persecuted; many are still in denial about the war (the very word “war” is censored out of the Russian media by the government . Yes, there is resistance — in Moscow alone, over 3,000 people have been detained in the past few days for protesting against the war. The scientific community is resisting as well: thousands of Russian scientists signed anopen lettercondemning the invasion, as didthousands of students and alums of my alma mater, the Moscow Institute of Science and Technology. However, active or passive support for the war from a large part of the public is undeniable, and it is likely that without it, this invasion would have not happened. This is a catastrophe for Russia and for the Russian people: a dark night is descending, and those least responsible for this war will suffer the most. I’m writing this from the safety of my Boston apartment, while people in Ukraine are dying and protesters in my hometown of Moscow face police brutality while attempting to salvage whatever may remain of our honor. Still I would appeal to my Russian friends at MIT and beyond: let us try to do what we can to support the Ukrainian people and stop the war. And to my beloved Ukrainians: I can only beg for forgiveness and pray that in a distant future — if humankind survives the current crisis — reconciliation will be possible.

rice_thresher_2022_70,"ByThresher Editorial Board1/11/22 10:00pm Recently, the Student Association introduced a resolution to structurally address disordered eating at Rice. Although the resolution contains tangible ways to mitigate this issue, we also believe that an important factor to consider is the culture on campus around eating disorders and food in general. Though this culture is not unique to Rice, we have the power to challenge it by being more conscious of how our language surrounding food affects others. A clear stigma exists around discussing disordered eating patterns. Rather than discussing disordered eating patterns seriously and honestly, it is more common for these patterns to be passed off as jokes and only mentioned off-handedly. This needs to change in order for disordered eating to be viewed seriously so it can be addressed through structural changes as well. At Rice, it has become not only common, but normalized to skip meals in favor of working on an assignment. Providing justification for disordered eating patterns in this way encourages those engaging in them to continue. Instead, we should all think critically about how the practice of skipping meals is problematic in the long run and should not be discussed so favorably, in order to disrupt the culture of disordered eating. Eating in a public setting such as the servery can increase anxiety related to food which contributes to disordered eating patterns. It is crucial to be aware of comments that we may make about the food that others choose to eat, particularly in regards to portion sizes and the specific items that they choose to put on their plate. Experts preachintuitive eatingto combat disordered eating patterns, and part of this means allowing people to eat what makes them feel good. Discussions surrounding food are not limited to the servery. A large number of social gatherings at Rice include food, from college nights to club events. We must be aware of our comments about others’ choices in these situations as well. That way these events, and campus spaces in general, can become more welcoming for those suffering from disordered eating. In some ways, the SA resolution designed to structurally address disordered eating at Rice only skims the surface of the problem at hand. Disordered eating is a habit that is primarily a function of what our culture promotes as desirable body standards. As such, it is our collective job not only to address disordered eating structurally, but also interpersonally, with the idea that many individuals working toward a common goal can change our culture for the better.

crimson_2022_74,"All Harvard students signed up for a liberal arts education when we decided to attend the College. But what exactly does this mode of scholarship entail? A liberal arts education is about developing a self — about figuring out who you want to become by immersing yourself in timeless texts, having conversations that open your eyes to previously-unconsidered perspectives or those you outright disagree with, and living in a campus community defined by common values. A liberal arts education involves admitting on a day-to-day basis that you came to college to grow, not to declare that you already know all the answers. We attend Harvard because we are all on a journey to discover who we want to become and how our passions and inclinations harmonize with the broader world. This journey involves academic exploration — hence, the General Education program, a uniquely flexible course registration system, and perhaps the most crucial academic element of all: the process of choosing our field of study. After three semesters of pure exploration, we declare a concentration, a roadmap which serves to orient us for the rest of our Harvard years. Most students are satisfied by pursuing a single field of study: They explore all the options, and decide that focusing on one field is their best academic path. But some students discover passions in two fields. They might be fascinated by Latin American politics and astrophysics, or ancient folklore and computer science. Unfortunately, the current joint concentration system often fails to encourage students to pursue their authentic interests. The joint thesis requirement, under which students must write a thesis that integrates the methods of two fields, is a significant burden that discourages many students from pursuing their preferred course of study. Students who do pursue joint concentrations are often caught between multiple advisors with different priorities for their joint theses, or find that they have to constrain their true interests to fit the requirement that the thesis combines both fields. To solve these issues, Harvard should introduce double concentrations and allow students who fulfill the course requirements for two fields to concentrate in both. Peer schools like the University of Chicago — a top-notch research university widely praised for its commitment to the liberal arts — have allowed students to double major for decades, providing a model for what this could look like at Harvard. It might appear that allowing students to concentrate in more than one field would incentivize students to pursue endless academic credentials. Any time the ceiling for possible achievement seems heightened, pressure increases for students to do and accomplish more in turn. However, better that some students take more classes and feel free to explore their interests than be railroaded into a single field that they feel obligated to engage with for its professional value. More and more students are coming to Harvard with expectations to pursue a course of study that leads directly to a lucrative job. These trends do not seem likely to reverse soon. Student interests are shifting rapidly; the number of Statistics, Computer Science, and Applied Math concentrators increased over fourfold from 2008 to 2019. In contrast, the number of sophomores declaring an arts and humanities concentrationdecreasedfrom 263 for the Class of 2013 to 115 for the Class of 2023. As student interests change, the best way to preserve the liberal arts is not to suggest that it does not matter at all what field you study, but rather to encourage students to make authentic choices in the face of outside pressures. If a student feels pressured to pursue a STEM concentration but discovers a love for philosophy in their first year, they ought to be able to pursue both fields, not give up their newfound interest altogether. Although students can always take courses outside their concentration, in practice, students will feel more connected to a field of study when it is formally part of their degree program. It might be a flaw of human nature that we want to be publicly rewarded and recognized for our efforts; nevertheless, we have to design systems that recognize the realities of our humanity. Instead of forcing students to twist their interests to fit the joint thesis requirement, or pushing students to give up and just pursue one field that seems more remunerative or prestigious, Harvard should give students the option of a double concentration — which will strengthen, not cheapen, the liberal arts. The Faculty Council should immediately approve a double concentrations proposal. It is not the case that having more choices is always better; sometimes it feels like we have so many choices that we don’t know who we are. But to preserve the possibilities of a liberal arts education in the face of rapidly changing interests and technological developments, allowing double concentrations is common sense. Michael Y. Cheng ’22, a History and Mathematics concentrator in Quincy House, is president of the Undergraduate Council. Emmett E. de Kanter ’24, an Integrative Biology concentrator in Winthrop House, is the vice president of the Undergraduate Council."
state_press_2022_6,"Sun Devil Stadium during the Territorial Cup on Saturday, Nov. 27, 2021. ASU won 38-15. According to theKnight Commission, the total revenue ASU had for sports was almost $118 million in the 2021-22 calendar year. Just under half of this revenue came from the institutional and government support, which makes sense because COVID-19 wreaked havoc on almost every college athletic program. Then comes NCAA distribution, media rights and post-season football, which brought in just over $21 million. This was followed by sponsors, advertising and licensing, accounting for over $17 million. What comes next is a shock for ASU, with student fees accounting for just over $11 million, which is more money than donor contributions and ticket sales combined. In fact, it was not even close with the two combining for only $8 million. ASU needs to find new ways to financially support athletics before it is too late. If ASU fails to find a way to increase both ticket sales and donor contributions, some students could choose to transfer or commit to a different college because of high fees. This is a problem that ASU does not want to have. To put this into perspective,ASU received over $15 millionin donor contributions compared to $11 million in student fees in 2020. In 2019, donor contributions were the highest they have ever been for ASU athletics with an almost whopping $25 million. One of the reasons for this occurrence is the two sports that bring in the most money in college athletics aremen s football and basketball. This was the year after ASU finished the2018-19 seasonone game short of making the Pac-12 tournament and finished the season with a thrilling41-40 comebackto win the Territorial Cup after scoring 20 unanswered points in the fourth quarter. ASU men s basketball ended the 2018-19 seasonsecond in the Pac-12and received an at-large bid to March Madness where theydefeated St. John sin the first four of March Madness. Both these programs showed a lot of potential, which donors saw. However, as both these programs ended up struggling after the 2018-19 season, donor money has decreased. There was a similar trend in ticket sales, as it brought in 12-14 million dollars almost every year until this year when it failed to bring in more than half a million dollars. Not only is ASU losing money, but it is spending a lot on athletic programs. Since 2016, ASU has increased its spending on athletics by 16%, while the Pac-12 conference average is down 1% and the Football Bowl Subdivision average is up 8% in that time. This is yet another issue ASU needs to fix. It will be difficult to increase donor contributions without winning teams. If ASU can put on donor events with different programs to try to draw in money, however, things could change. In addition, some of the facilities likeDesert Financial Arenaare in much need of renovation. A renovation of the basketball arena could bring in some donor money to help with the renovations and attract more fans to attend the game. If ASU does not want to renovate DFA, they could havethe basketballteam play in the new ASU Multipurpose Arena. This smaller arena could give the games a more electric atmosphere going from a 14,198-seatstadium to 5,000. ASU football is in a similar boat with only being able to sell out one game last year. Coincidentally, that was also family weekend at ASU, which was the main reason the game was sold out and by halftime, the stadium was beginning to empty. I only went to a few footballs and basketball games this year, said Cris Cordova, a sophomore majoring in business with a focus in sustainability. The games I went to hadempty seatseverywhere and the atmosphere was very quiet. The one game that had fans at it was against USC (football , but I left with my parents at halftime. For all sports, ASU typically has giveaways for students, like free shirts and towels, which brings in student fans to games. ASU should have giveaway nights like free shirts, rally towels and bobblehead nights for everyone in attendance, not just students, to try and get fans to go to games. Some of these people could end up going for free items and find out they enjoy going to ASU games. This will allow the program to make more passive income without having to punish students by making them pay fees. Students should not have to pay for ASU s lack of creativity.

thetech_mit_2022_51,"This is Madeleine Sutherland, fifth year Chemistry PhD candidate. It was my honor to serve as the MIT Graduate Student Council (GSC President in 2020–21 and as chair of the Ashdown House Exec Council in 2019–20. My time serving in these roles offered me a bird’s-eye view of both the lives of graduate students and the work being done to improve our working conditions. I am sending this memo above all because I love MIT, and I am so grateful to be part of this fabulous community. AsUfuoma Ovienmhada recently illustratedwith such crystalline elegance, this love requires me tospeak plainlyand join my colleagues in collective action to bring about a more just reality. Many faculty members, including administrators, view us graduate workers as MIT’s most valuable asset. I share their belief that the greatest thing about MIT is our community of scholars, who advance works of immense value to humanity, from discovering and predicting how biological molecules interact, to understanding how organizations of humans can best collaborate to solve problems, to building sustainable and climate change-fighting technology. It’s because MIT attracts such high caliber graduate researchers that we make such an impact on the world, and that makes me want to fight for all of us. Labs, field sites, offices, and other research environments are workplaces where graduate workers produce tremendous value for MIT, doing the work that earns the Institute prestige, patents, and grants. When negotiating with an administration that refuses to recognize what we do every day aswork, I had little power to meaningfully address problems and make improvements in our conditions and compensation. For example, when I needed to discuss the “Research Ramp-Up” plan for campus spaces that failed to account for grad workers’ human needs to eat and drinksomewhere, I had to establish a whole new set of connections with parties the GSC doesn’t normally deal with, such as the Vice President for Research (and the Lightning Committee and Associate Provosts. Nobody on the GSC Officer team reallyhad time to do that, and we were already stretched thin. So, the research I actually came to MIT to do suffered. Multiple bodies across the Institute refuse to respect the GSC’s democratic processes for choosing representatives to high-impact committees. Further, many administrative offices simplyinformGSC officers of a decision mere hours or days before announcing it and then act as though they’d gained our consent. In the same breath, they ask us to do work for them, then fail to act upon the information and insight we generate. In short,we have not been treated like a professional organization of people who are carrying out MIT’s core missionevery day. MIT’s current administration asks us to place our trust in a purportedly collaborative process in which they ultimately have all the decision-making power and we can only provide recommendations and suggestions.But my interactions with our administration and what I saw during my tenure as GSC president undermined that trust. I cannot trust the administration that agreed to research assistantship extensions for PhD students whose thesis research was delayed by COVID, then waited for eight to nine months (and many emails from us to actively inform grad students across campus that such funds were available. I cannot trust the administration that doesn’t appear to address the frequency or pattern of lab accidents at MIT and meanwhile creates an environment wherein the grad students and postdocs working in the labs are sleep-deprived and stressed and thus prone to accidents. I really can’t trust the organization within whichCampus Planning and Housing administrators promised the Citythey’d create 950 new beds of grad student housing in the spirit ofbroad-baseddemands foraffordablehousing, then refused to share cost details of Site 4 planning with the GSC until it was too late to avoid “Efficiency”rentsequal to 67% of the base 12-month doctoral research assistantstipend. This administration pats themselves on the back for including the GSC in the annual stipend adjustment process, butthose of us who have been on the Stipend Working Group know that process is flawed.We knew that we had a predetermined amount of money and could only make suggestions as to its allocation. The participants consisted of those who read GSC recruiting emails and could take an inordinate amount of time away from their research and teaching work to follow a predetermined process. And the scope of this committee kept growing as we tried — struggled — toaddress other aspects of our life and workbeyond our base stipends. Successive administrations continue to treat Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI like a “problem” or “issue” to “solve” on a “committee” or “task force.” They fail to recognize that lack of DEI is a roadblock for the whole Institute, one that fundamentally limits our capacity to achieve our mission. That is what happens when skilled and talented people can’t fully participate because of racism, sexism, ableism, and xenophobia. That is the reality our fellowgrad workers have documentedprofusely,methodically, andscientifically,timeandagain. Many professional and advocacy organizations of grad workers, especially the Black Graduate Student Association, have proffered explicit and well-researched recommendations, whichhaven’t been prioritizedor acted upon. As a union, we set the agenda for improving our institution. We can build onour past victoriesto secure meaningful institutional change. The only way to change this status quo with national law behind us is to form a collective bargaining unit — in other words, a union. As GSC President, I didn’t only work with the administration. I also collaborated with dozens of graduate workers whose innovations and discoveries are changing the world. My experience taught me that it’s MIT grad students I can trust to fact-check, think critically, and plan inclusively on all levels. After all, it was fellow graduate researchers who joined me indocumenting the tremendous impactthe pandemic has had on our research. By unionizing, we empower ourselves to use these very skills to shape our working conditions.When it comes to getting you the resources you need to succeed, an organization of your peers is far more trustworthy than an administration which refuses to recognize the basic facts of your position,your daily reality.Make no mistake — the Graduate Student Union isus.Through forming a union, we give every graduate worker a literal vote in who represents us, and with what agenda, and how we wish to get our voice heard. That’s why I hopetovote yesthe moment we overcome MIT’s attempt to lock us Fellows out of our bargaining unit. I hope you’ll join me! Madeleine Sutherland is a fifth-year PhD candidate in Chemistry and served as GSC President in 2020–21."
crimson_2022_23,"I can picture it now. You and your best friend sit in a secluded corner of the dining hall, catching up between bites of Veritaffles, Red’s Best Catch, or some other HUDS classic. Maybe it’s midterm season, and the pile of papers or excess of exams has been gnawing away at your happiness. You start to rant about how hard life has been recently. Before you know it, the floodgates are open. That toxic thing your parents did or the unluckiest day of your life so far is unearthed. Seeing your friend’s shell-shocked stare and palpable discomfort, you realize that you just trauma-dumped. Not to be confused with ranting or venting, trauma dumping is much more serious. It often involves oversharing intense information without consent, in the wrong place or at the wrong time, with a person who is not prepared to absorb the information — which could explain your hypothetical friend’s uneasy reaction. This definition makes it seem like trauma dumping only strains your relationships with others, but it can also nourish them. Being vulnerable and spilling your guts can bring people closer, making trauma dumping an essential part of friendship-making for some people. Trauma dumping doesn’t have to be awkward or upsetting, like the common definition suggests. With just a few simple steps, you can pull off a better version of a trauma dump: one that maximizes positive vulnerability and sharing, without triggering any embarrassment, shock, or discomfort. The first step for better trauma dumping is to determine why you want to overshare. There’s surely some deep psychological reason for why you’re looking to unload your life story in general, but what are the social cues of a given moment that make you feel inclined to let the emotional avalanche out? Did your friend just now share a story about their childhood? Did they just finish trauma dumping themself? The answers to these questions may show that you’re engaging in unhealthy trauma politics. Trauma politics at Harvard, where many students arrive having already sold their life before Harvard as a tragic essay for the admissions office, are complicated. For students that come from less privileged backgrounds, hardship can feel like their only distinguishing factor against wealthier, more well-connected peers. If hearing about your friend’s childhood evokes a strange sense of covert competition before the urge to trauma dump, you might be using your trauma to prove your worth. Although these manifestations ofimpostor syndromeare powerful, do your best to ignore them. You have value outside of your trauma; you don’t need to relive pain to justify your existence here. The only right reason to trauma dump is for your own benefit. Perhaps you hope to find catharsis or believe your friend can help you cope. As long as the motivation for trauma dumping centers on you, and you alone, proceed to step two. Now that you have looked inward and believe that trauma dumping will help you, look outward and consider how trauma dumping will impact your friend. The classic definition of trauma dumping has you oversharing without consent, but a better trauma dump necessitates getting permission before beginning to dump. Today, trauma is a nebulous concept: For some people, it constitutes minor inconvenience, but for others, it carries a much heavier significance. Give your friend a sense of the gravity of your incoming trauma, and ask if they are prepared to listen. It is possible that your friend is not ready. Listening to another person’s intense emotional experiences can be draining, especially when one is already low on emotional bandwidth. Perhaps the subject you want to talk about is one of your friend’s triggers. If your friend declines to listen, for whatever reason, be understanding and do not push the issue. At this moment rife with strong emotions for yourself, it’s important to have empathy for others’ emotions as well. Now, imagine that your friend agrees to hear you through. You divulge the details of something in your life. The trauma dump ends. But even though you finished speaking, guilt grips you. You are seized by the impulse to apologize for oversharing. Stop. You trauma dumped for the right reasons. Your friend declared their willingness to participate. The final step of a proper trauma dump is to not apologize. Vulnerability is scary: Opening up your insecurities to the greater scrutiny of more eyes feels shameful and thus impossibly difficult. These feelings can protect you from harm in uncertain social situations, but they can also isolate you. If you trust your friend enough to have made it this far in the guide to trauma dumping, do not give in to the temptation to take it all back. You can be open, honest, and authentic around the people you trust without owing them an apology. If you absolutely feel that you have to say something, try gratitude: Instead of apologizing for yourself, thank your friend for their kindness and patience in listening. With that, a successful trauma dump ends, avoiding any awkwardness, uneasiness, or thoughtlessness. You have gained the benefits of trauma dumping without the harms associated with the typical process. If you want bonus points (and you’re a Harvard student, so I’m sure you do , a final, final step is to be kind to yourself. You are on the cusp of childhood and adulthood, navigating classes and relationships, and still figuring out how to synthesize your experiences to become a capable, functioning member of society. If trauma dumping responsibly while eating Veritaffles makes that any easier, go right ahead. Libby E.

stanforddaily_2022_5,"I grew up in a pretty secular environment, although I did have some religious influences throughout my upbringing. In my interactions with Christians and Muslims prior to Stanford, I got the general impression that most people within these communities hold “traditional” beliefs towards social issues such as abortion, substance use and LGBTQ+ rights. I’d thought that most religious people are socially conservative, and I was certain that almost all White Christians had voted for Trump. My interactions with religious students on campus have shown me that my perceptions were false. Over the past year, I have met Christian students from all over the political spectrum. From attending Jumu’ah (Friday prayer this quarter, I’ve gotten the chance to speak to many students within Stanford’s Muslim community about their political beliefs. Once again, I encountered a diversity of views. My conversation with Arwa Faruk, a sophomore from New Mexico, left a strong impression on me. Born to Bangladeshi immigrants in Houston, Arwa is a stellar artist, and a practicing Muslim. During her time at Stanford, Arwa has felt that people are “more hesitant to approach her , or invite her to things” because they expect that she — a hijab-wearing Muslim — holds traditionalist political views. But Arwa is in fact very progressive. Many people have reacted with surprise after learning about heractualpolitical beliefs. “Perceived Polarization”are the differences that are notactuallythere. They are the differences we mistakenly assume exist between ourselves and others based on their racial, cultural, sexual, gender, socioeconomic or religious identities. And even when general differences actually exist, they are often exaggerated and sensationalized. To illustrate this, let’s examine two of the most contentious current topics: namely, abortion and affirmative action. Prima facie, one would think that most religious people believe that abortion should be illegal and that most Black and Hispanic people believe that colleges should consider race/ethnicity as a factor in admissions. However, neither of these perceptions are true. According to a2022 Pew Research Center survey, most Black and Hispanic people believe colleges should not consider race/ethnicity at all in admissions (59% and 68%, respectively . And on abortion, a2014 Pew surveyfound that stances on the legality of abortion vary drastically across different religious groups. The majority of Muslims, Non-evangelical Protestants, Jews and nearly a half of Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all/most cases. The persistence of distorted views based on fundamental aspects of personal identity (such as race and religion inevitably result in distortions in the political sphere. When people think of the prototypical liberal, they would likely imagine a young, irreligious person of color; but, in reality, the median liberal voterandthe median conservative voter are both a middle-aged White Protestant.A 2018 studyby Ahler and Sood found that Americans thought nearly a third of Democrats were LGBT — when in fact only 6% are. They also believed that 38% of Republicans earn more than $250,000 per year — when in fact only 2% do. Our distorted views about various identity groups and about the composition of political groups culminate in perceived polarization manifesting in party politics.A 2018 surveyby More in Common found that Democrats and Republicans have drastically distorted perceptions about what people in the opposing party actually believe. Surveyed Democrats estimated that only 51% of Republicans believe “racism still exists in America,” when in reality, 79% of Republicans agreed with that statement. Conversely, surveyed Republicans estimated that 52% of Democrats believe that “most police are bad people,” when in reality, only 15% of Democrats agreed with that statement. The startling gap between our perception and reality demonstrates the failings of our innate mental processes. We tend to picture an unfamiliar group as a uniform whole, rather than an amalgam of diverse parts. This, in turn, causes us to view out-groups as more extreme, homogenous and different from us than they actually are. Perceived polarization makes us replace a group’s actual beliefs with the beliefs of its most extreme and vocal constituents. The ultimate takeaway here is to keep an open mind. We should view people we encounter asindividualswith nuanced views and unique lived experiences, rather than avatars of their group identities. We should also examine whether the beliefs we hold about certain groups really apply to all of its members; there often exists greater differences within groups than between groups. But above all, we should seek to talk to people with identities different to our own: I believe we will find more in common than we think.

rice_thresher_2022_27,"ByThresher Editorial Board8/30/22 10:35pm Three years ago, in the pre-COVID world, there were only three public parties that charged for admittance. NOD and Y2K needed the money to hire extra security, and Architectronica charged because it wasn’t funded by a college and depended on the money from ticket sales to cover event fees. Now, we fear more colleges will charge for entrance to publics, a poor practice we urge socials to avoid. Three years later, as publics finally return in full force, seniors who had a taste of the old, free publics find themselves perplexed by the new changes while reminiscing about the lost institutional knowledge of pre-pandemic Rice. But tradition isn’t the only thing that the new “pay for wristband” system is harming. Though $5 and under price tags generally wouldn’t prohibit any student from attending, it has sparked a growing resale market with wristbands being sold for upwards of $20. This resale market especially affects freshmen, who already feel social pressure to fit into college culture and are likely to buy these resale tickets even at an unreasonable price. Further, paying without clear justification to attend a public defeats the purpose of a “public” party. Despite all of this, buying and securing wristbands doesn’t even guarantee adittance. Tickets are typically oversold, as in the case of Martel College’s public last Saturday, which results in extended lines and destroys the original purpose of charging a fee: limiting capacity. Three years ago, capacity issues solved themselves. With security monitoring the crowd inside, everyone could show up and line up; when the line felt too long, people simply left. Not to mention that most students do not intend on staying at a public from beginning to end. But being required to pay for admission and the extensive process required to secure a wristband might alter that, decreasing the number of overall students who are able to attend at all. With the university expanding its student population, the issue of limited attendance at popular student events will only become more prevalent. Conversations surrounding how to preserve the old Rice culture and to ensure the same college experience for future Rice students need to be a focus for the administration and individual residential colleges alike.

wildcat_arizona_2022_4,"Kali Waechter (left , Stephanie Garcia (center and Michelle Ochoa (right protest abortion bans in front of 33 North Stone Ave. Saturday, Oct. 2, 2021, in Tucson. The “Rally for Abortion Justice” took place in Armory Park. For a long time, women were regarded as soft, weak and delicate. Their value was in looking pretty. They were meant to have children, cook, clean, sew, take care of children and be silent. To be seen and not heard. Women’s rights have progressed monumentally, and Women’s History Month is a celebration of all of the important ways that women have contributed and continue to contribute to society; but, even today, women — girls especially — are berated left and right for their every like and dislike, from trends and fashion to popular culture. The Humanist’sMargie Delao breaks down the four major waves of feminism simply: the first wave — that of icon Susan B. Anthony and the suffragettes, brought women the right to vote in 1920. The second wave, in the mid-to-late twentieth century, sought to conquer the wage gap and reproductive rights (though it ignored other inequalities, like racial discrimination and class differences and the third wave in the 1990s broke down the barrier of “femininity” as a whole and not only redefined the term, but even rejected it outright. The latest wave of feminism, the fourth wave that we’re riding right now, brought with it the #MeToo movement, brought down abusers of the past and began to challenge sex and gender norms. This feminism looks radically different than Susan B. Anthony’s stiff-collared crusade for voting rights, but it’s still important. With all these waves of feminism and the definition of the word itself as ever changing as the tide, what makes a woman a woman has changed. RELATED:OPINION: Women are caught in the middle of evolving beauty standards Sometimes women wear big baggy pants and giant t-shirts, sometimes they wear tight, figure-bearing athletic clothes and sometimes they wear soft fairy-like skirts. They’re still a woman through it all. So why can’t we as a society stop berating them every step of the way? Girls have always been made fun of for every fashion and culture trend. As a teenager in the mid 2010s, I was made fun of for wearing pastel jeans and high-waisted shorts. As a teenager today, my sister’s friends get made fun of for wearing baggy jeans, also skinny jeans and also for wearing pants that aren’t jeans (never my sister, though. She has an attitude that could make a full-grown man in a biker gang cry . I’ve written before about how music trends are often made fun of because girls listen to it. The “VSCO girl” trend, with its scrunchies and Hydroflasks and reusable straws, rose to popularity and then was immediately tanked by people making fun of it. There are so many things in this world that are demeaned by society because girls like it. The list goes on and on. Taylor Swift, Starbucks, scrunchies, boy bands, tumblers with straws, sororities, gel pens, Birkenstocks … shall I continue? I think that it’s important to let people enjoy things so long as it is in a way that does not harm anyone. That applies to everyone, regardless of gender. We need to stop ridiculing people for what they like, even if it’s something that may seem “weird” to us. RELATED:OPINION: The University of Arizona needs to stand in support of the Equal Rights Amendment I do think, however, that it is especially prominent that girls take the biggest brunt of ridiculing, because girls just can’t win. You’re a girl, and you like the color pink, drink Starbucks and drive a Jeep? How basic. Embarrassing. You’re a girl, and you like wearing athletic clothes, play sports and don’t wear makeup? You’re a “pick me” girl. Embarrassing. You’re a girl, and you like wearing oversized men’s clothes, read books and stay in on the weekends? Boring. Embarrassing. It seems like our society has no right answer for what a woman should wear or do or like, so I’m here to say that they are all right. We are all women, regardless of our appearance or our likes and dislikes. We have to stop letting other people define us and categorize us, and instead learn to accept ourselves as who we are, even if that identity slides from one end of the spectrum to the next every single day. There are so many ways to be a woman and only you can decide what the right way is for you. Enjoy women’s history month this March and celebrate all the women in your life, including yourself.

crimson_2022_126,"For the first time at Harvard, I feel heard as a Palestinian. When The Crimson Editorial Boardpublishedtheir unequivocal backing of Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions of Israel, I felt that a milestone had been reached. For years, organizers with the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee and its divestment campaign have hosted speaker events, held rallies, and called for boycotts. Ourmissionhas always been simple: supporting the Palestinian struggle for self-determination, justice, and equality. Too often, unfortunately, this organizing attractsbacklash, hate, and relentless smear campaigns, the intent of which is to deny the reality of lived Palestinian experience and silence voices. This year’s Board has shown us that our work is being seen. Our voices are being heard. Now, it is time for wider action from the Harvard community. PSC members have persevered despite the constant backlash, institutionally-backed opposition, and threats. I will not shy away from the fact that these challenges frequently came from The Crimson itself. On some occasions, we struggled to guarantee representative reporting. On others, members voiced their distress that they were denied the right to publish anonymously as supporting Palestine publicly can lead to online harassment, a profile on websites likeCanary Mission, or the blatant label of antisemitism. But today, I am proud to be at Harvard during this time. I am proud that The Crimson Editorial Board is listening to our voices. They were brave enough to stand for justice. Their support of BDS is a defiant recognition of Israel’s crimes against humanity. They finally listened to what Palestinians, including those at Harvard, have been calling for for decades. As expected, The Crimson has been inundated withimmense opposition. This opposition is all too familiar to PSC members and social justice activists. The uncomfortable truth is that people don’t like to be called out for excusing apartheid. There will always be those who treat Palestine as an exception; there will always be those who refuse to admit the reality which is only now coming to be seen as truth: that Palestinians live under apartheid. Amnesty InternationalandHuman Rights Watchare typically considered credible sources. When it comes to Palestine, however, it seems that their readers throw their credibility out the window. Even the reports of leading Israeli organizations likeB tselemandYesh Dinhave fallen on deaf ears. People simply refuse to confront the blatant facts that stare them dead in the eye. Why? Because to do so means confronting the reality that the narrative they cherish so dearly is a reality of what U.N. human rights investigators have deemedethnic cleansingof Palestinians. Protesting and speaking up are encouraged until the moment you mention Palestine. Then you must stay silent. Boycott and divestment are effective tools for achieving political liberation until you apply them to Palestine. Then you aren t being ‘nuanced’ enough. The Board put it best: “Israel remains America’s favorite first amendment blindspot.” Must the world always be this way? No. The time for change is here, human rights are not complicated. There are no preconditions for ending apartheid. There is no exception. There is no inconvenient time to call for the liberation of a suffering people. We will not stop advocating for justice no matter who stands against us. Some loud, powerful, and influential voices on campus believe that Palestinian humanity and human rights are up for debate; they proudly stand behind an apartheid system. All this does is fuel us to speak louder. They will push back. They will slander. They will intimidate. We will organize. We will boycott. We will hold our ground. Why? Because our morals compel us to take this stand. Because the tide is changing on campus. Because we cannot be silent about human rights abuses. There are still those members of our community who feel it’s “too complicated” to take a stand. I say to those people as they waver on the fence to open their eyes to the brutal apartheid regime that Palestinians live under. I admire the courage of the students who decided to take a stance this semester and boycott Israel Trek. You have shown Harvard that BDS has an impact. You are proof that we can and must fight injustice at every point we confront in the world. You do not need to see it or experience it to understand it. A significant milestone it may be, but this is merely one stop in a long struggle toward freedom. Calls for divestment are not attempts to politicize a ‘neutral’ institution. This institution has never been neutral. The decision to invest in fossil fuels, prisons, andIsraeli apartheidwere politicized decisions. Harvard Out of Occupied Palestinedemandsthe University rectify that decision. We will continue to demand that the University disclose its direct and indirect investments in companies complicit in human rights abuses towards Palestinians; divest such holdings; and reinvest in Palestinian history, culture, and communities. You should too. Nadine S. Bahour ’22, a Neurosciences concentrator in Leverett House, was co-president of the Palestinian Solidarity Committee."
state_press_2022_53,"Arizona saw a robust monsoon season this year and the last storm was exceptional. Experts are saying we should get used to extreme weather fluctuations as climate change steadily makes our planet uninhabitable. We ve been in a cold snap this past week, at least as close to a cold snap as we can be in Arizona. After a storm so powerful evenIronmancontestants were afraid to hop into Tempe Town Lake (who wouldn t be , Arizona is permanently 10 degrees cooler. The colder temperatures are welcome, but I m out here shaking like a leaf in moderate weather. We re still in what any East Coaster would call summer, but the difference between 60 and 70 degrees is like the Caribbean and Antarctica when your body makeup is a 90% match to a lizard s. Last week s storm aside, Arizonans look forward to clear skies ahead. So clear, in fact, that I have a suspicion we can expect much more consistent temperatures from now on. Well, less of a suspicion and more like decades of climate science. Expect wildfires in the streets and never-ending drought in the coming days. It is now consistently the apocalypse! Arizona residents have surely seen the classic Smokey the Bear fire danger indicators around the state, but what locals don t know is that there s an unofficial sixth category of danger, beyond Very High. Parks and Recreation employees, it s time to dust off your Hell Hath Risen signs and fireproof suits — the Bear doesn t know what s about to hit him. We ll spend a few months cooking in this fiery inferno, and then just as the smoke clears, before we even have a chance to forge a bartering-based economy for rations, thefloodswill begin. You d think we d be grateful, but apparently dumping tons of water onto drought-ridden land actually makes things worse? Experts are saying we should get used to extreme weather fluctuations as climate change steadily makes our planet uninhabitable, but I d like to say we have a chance at saving ourselves. ASU iscarbon neutral! Renewable energy is on the rise! Democrats have the House! … until they lose it. Cars are becoming electric! Cars … are becoming electric? They do know that s not the problem, right? We ve got to be kidding ourselves. All that really matters is how buoyant a raft those electric cars will make when Arizona becomes a coastal state. Temperatures in Arizona have risen 2.5 degrees since 1901. That might not seem like a lot, but think of it this way: If an asteroid were barreling toward the earth and we had the chance to push it just two degrees to the left, saving the world, they d start to seem much more important. So, we remain at this crossroads. A fork in the road leading to utter destruction or sustainable living, and as obvious as that choice sounds, we ve been debating walking toward utter destruction for the past 50 years. It s a daunting task, trying to save the planet. But as of right now, it s all we can do. And though you, dear reader, are likely not a billionaire oil tycoon, there are small steps we can take to add a few more weeks to the countdown. Stayinginformed,voting wiselyand holdinglarge waste-contributingcompanies accountable are ways that we regular folk can make a difference. But on the off-chance you are a billionaire oil tycoon, I hope you feel pretty stupid right now. Edited by Sadie Buggle, David Rodish, Grace Copperthite and Piper Hansen.

state_press_2022_24,"This trip is to celebrate their college experience coming to an end. However, this voyage will be at the expense of the health and wellbeing of the people and environment of Hawaii. Barrett, The Honors College is planning to take seniors on a trip to Hawaii in March. This trip is to celebrate the students college experience coming to an end. However, this voyage will be at the expense of the health and wellbeing of the Hawaiian people and environment of Hawaii as well as the trip failing to address the colonial history in the island. Those who opposed the trip began to unite with apetition. The main arguments against it are because the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and due to the pandemic, Hawaiians have asked tourists to forego visiting forrecreation. Despite this, most tourists who visitHawaiiare going for vacation, not for necessary reasons. These high numbers show that the only thing more widespread than COVID-19 is ignorance and selfishness. According to Nicole Greason, director of marketing and public relations for Barrett, The itinerary for this trip includes visits to historically, culturally and ecologically significant sites and activities including Iolani Palace, Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head and Hanauma Bay and a traditional Hawaiian luau. In addition, students will participate in a community service project giving back to the local community. The college is also planning on holding meetings to learn about the history and culture of Hawaii to assuage the demands of opponents of the trip. However, these niceties are not enough. Obviously, the people in charge don t care about any of the issues I brought up, and the petition was only enough to convince them to add a community service activity. In my view, this is below the bare minimum, said Elise Crawford-Paz Soldan, a senior in Barrett studying conservation biology and ecology and art studies. Crawford-Paz Soldan started the petition, which has gotten over 300 signatures, against the trip to Hawaii. AlthoughCOVID-19numbers were at their worst in Hawaii last summer, the islands saw another surge in cases just last month due to the omicron variant. Despite this, Barrett continued to plan its trip. Even though COVID-19 only further complicates the current situation in Hawaii, it s not the only reason why tourists should stay away. The petition highlights the history of colonization in Hawaii. According toSmithsonian Magazine, Hawaii was first settled by Polynesians in A.D. 400, but white Europeans did not discover theislanduntil 1778. Settlers took control of Hawaii, overthrew the kingdom and annexed the islands as an American territory against the will of the native people. Like many Indigenous American groups, Native Hawaiians were decimated by disease. After contact with white settlers, the Native Hawaiian population dropped from 300,000 to 70,000. Colonization massacred almost two-thirds of the Native Hawaiian population. They say history repeats itself, which may be why people are,once again, bringing disease to Hawaii even after being asked not to come. Even without disease as a factor, tourism still has a negative impact on the environment and economy of Hawaii, creating anunhealthyco-dependence of the economy on tourists. To quote an article fromCultural Survival, In Hawai i, the destruction of our land and the prostitution of our culture is planned and executed by multi-national corporations, by huge landowners, and by collaborationist state and county governments.” Tourists are beginning to outnumber Hawaiian residents. This has caused the cost of living to skyrocket, driving Native Hawaiians closer to poverty and forcing them to leave their homeland in search of better conditions. Becauseof this, Native Hawaiians have begun to protest. Many of them want to overthrow the American government in Hawaii. Not only are they being driven out of their homes, but most of the new construction taking place on the island is bulldozing over sacred land, stripping Hawaiians of their culture for profit. This shows colonization is not just a historical term, but an ongoing process that ignores the voices of those who truly care about the land. I think it s just wildly irresponsible. And it s kind of disrespectful of a lot of wishes that have come from Hawaiians themselves, asking people not to come,” said Logan Franklin, a senior studying conservation biology and ecology. At this point, Barrett has a decision on whether or not they want to cancel the trip. Although this would be a disappointment to some students, it would be the most selfless action. However, this seems unlikely, as the trip is set to move forward. What may be a fun spring break weekend for a group of privileged college students will be at the detriment of the long-term wellbeing of the citizens of Hawaii.

crimson_2022_151,"Every first-year student at Harvard swipes their ID at Annenberg dining hall and walks past a portrait of Charles Sumner. After graduating from Harvard College, Sumner spent 22 years as a public servant representing Massachusetts in the Senate. Throughout his time in Congress, he was famous for his fierce support for the abolition of slavery and unpopular belief in equality for all people. For his accomplishments, Sumner deserves to have a Harvard House in his name. On May 5th, 2022, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay sent out an email detailing a new institutional process for FAS affiliates to petition for the denaming of Harvard structures. Per that email, the administration will consider denaming spaces “based on the perception that a namesake s actions or beliefs were ‘abhorrent’ in the context of current values.” The new denaming process has one glaring omission, however: Students seemingly cannot argue for whom these structures should be renamed — they can scrub names, but offer no alternatives. Renaming is a significant part of restoring the harm of the name that came before. It offers an opportunity to permanently reconstitute whomever we choose. The goal is not just ripping down plaques of those that have lagged behind the moral character of Harvard; the ultimate goal is to celebrate the people that represent the best of the University. Case in point: the unwavering stances in the pursuit of justice that defined Senator Charles Sumner’s career in the halls of Congress. In cooperation with members of the Women’s National Loyal League, he helped organize a petition with over half a million signatures for the abolition of slavery, which he used to push for the expansion of the Emancipation Proclamation. Furthermore, his proposal for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery was too radical for some of his colleagues, as it attempted to recognize emancipated Black Americans equally under the law. He also famously initially opposed the 14th Amendment, because the bill did not sufficiently protect the right of Black Americans to vote. In these and other ways, Sumner was the John Brown of the legislature, uncompromising in his belief in the universal rights of men. Charles Sumner’s ideological framework was far from epiphany. Charles Pinckney Sumner, Senator Sumner’s father, played an influential role in shaping his son’s politics. Also a graduate of Harvard College, he instilled his own abolitionist views in his son, teaching thatabolitionwould mean nothing unless white Americans were willing to “learn to have a good feeling toward Black Americans , and treat them as well.” Moreover, Sumner’s grandfather, Job Sumner, fought for freedom during the colonial period. Job was admitted to Harvard at age 20, entering in November of 1774. When the American Revolution erupted, Sumner joined up with the patriot army, putting to use the skills he had learned with a Harvard military company that would later become known as the “Harvard Washington Corps.” Major Sumner was later recognized by the President and Fellows of Harvard University for his service in the armed forces, who honored him with a Master of Arts degree. When the eldest Sumner died, then-Vice President John Adams, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and other revolutionary officers attended Job Sumner’s funeral. Sumner House has no shortage of names to replace. As of now, two of Harvard College’s Houses, Winthrop House and Mather House, arenamedafter slaveholders. Eliot House and Lowell House, meanwhile, have eugenicists as namesakes. Presuming that chattel slavery, the genocide of native peoples, and belief in eugenics have become “‘abhorrent’ in the context of current values,” these Houses surely qualify to be denamed. It would be especially fitting that a family with a lineage of abolitionists replaces a family with a lineage of enslavers: the Winthrops. Governor John Winthrophelpedjustify the Pequot War by claiming the superiority of advanced peoples to assert their “civil right” to the land. Heownedthe wife and two unnamed sons of Pequot sachem Mononotto and at least four other unidentified Indigenous people. The younger John Winthrop, a President of Harvard, owned two enslaved people named George and Scipio. To replace Winthrop House with Sumner House would be a symbolic gesture, but a significant one — a sign of a more serious commitment by Harvard to reckon with its ugliest history while embracing its best. There are few families tied to the legacy of Harvard that come close to the honor and fortitude of the Sumner Family. Those who we choose to memorialize define what we as the Harvard community want to embody in the future. As we work to become a more just community, we must reckon with our history. That process can begin at Sumner House. Prince Williams ’25 is a History Concentrator in Adams House."
stanforddaily_2022_90,"Just like you and I, plants need nutrients to grow, reproduce and eventually end up in the produce area of our nearest Safeway grocery store. From there, we get the broccoli home, and it hangs out in our fridge with its carrot friends while we end up ordering pizza or going to our cousin’s friend’s partner’s birthday dinner. Eventually, someone in our household decides the broccoli is lowering the real-estate value of our fridge, and in72% of US homes, our broccoli friend ends up in the landfill bin (“normal” trash . So then, end of story — right? Wrong. These “green trees”, as my mom used to call them, then make their way from your street-side bin to the local landfill, which is essentially a big ditch that is dug out only to be filled back up by dump trucks of trash and dirt repeatedly until you have a mountain. The broccoli is visited by bacteria, which think it is quite tasty. In their feasting, these microbes produce methane gas, a greenhouse gas28 to 36 timesmore powerful than carbon dioxide. These tiny microbes in landfills around the world produce the same combined annual emissions as21.6 million internal combustion cars. Although this all might be super impressive microbial biology, it is not good news for addressing climate change. This linear path from fridge to trash to landfill could instead be circularized, with the broccoli entering a municipal compost program and rejoining the farm as fertilizer. So what if we could give broccoli a different funeral eulogy? I am a Ph.D. student at Stanford University studying soil nutrient cycling in agriculture. I strongly believe that it is nonsense that our “full-of-valuable-nutrients” organics end up in the landfill, while we use fossil fuels and excessive amounts of energy to produce new fertilizer. Apparently, I am not alone in this frustration. A group of scientists compiled the most effective strategies to combat climate change in Project Drawdown and calculated that reducing food waste would be thethird-most effective strategy– yet we are still not doing it. According to a survey by the National Waste & Recycling Association,77% of Americanssay they understand the importance of separating food and yard waste from general waste, and 68% say they would be willing to manage another bin for organic waste if required to do so. And this opportunity has now come for California residents, asSB 1383requires all jurisdictions to provide organic waste collection services to households and businesses. Food crops need nitrogen to grow, which typically comes in two forms: synthetic or organic fertilizers. Synthetic fertilizers are veryenergy intensiveto produce, and after they are applied, they quickly wash down out of the soil and into surface-water systems that you and I rely on, along with ourfish friends. The life cycle of farm nutrients should be circular. Turning food waste into organic fertilizer provides a diverse diet for soil biology while adding organic matter to the soil, which improves water andnutrient-holding capacityalong withcarbon storage. Some might be concerned that designing a “sustainable” destination for food waste would disincentivize the need to reduce it in the first place. I would argue, however, that separating the food waste into organic bins finally allows people to realize that they are essentially leaving the grocery store with three bags only to drop one bag in the parking lot — indeed, the average American household wastes31.9%of the food it buys, or an estimated$1,866annually. That’s a lot of dough! So, you may be thinking: well, yes, all of this makes sense — but what can I do about it? Everywhere you go, simply ask where you might find the organic waste bin. I have actually done this — waving my banana peel while asking for the organics bin — knowing full well that there was not a bin in sight. If you live in an apartment or housing complex without an organic waste bin, ask the front office to provide one. If you are a homeowner or landlord, ask your municipal government to include organic waste bins in the city’s collection program. In other words, without a strong demand from residents, governments will be hesitant to fund collection and composting programs. Those of us who are already part of “club compost” might argue that it can be leaky and smelly. And if left for too long, it is transformed into a habitat for many (many bacterial friends. Well, I completely agree with you. When I lived in Sweden, this problem was avoided due to their municipality-suppliedpaper-bag system. This system led to more frequent disposal and fewer messy situations overall. There are options. Let’s give our broccoli friend a happier story ending to its story by making sure our broccoli remains end up in the organic waste bin. Growing up in a rural farming community in northern California, Anna started working with a local vegetable farmer and started her own plant business, Anna’s Herbs. Wanting to teach agricultural science and spread public awareness about food production, Anna went to the University of California, Davis to get a Bachelor of Science in Agricultural and Environmental Education. She then became fascinated by the role of research in addressing the challenges farmers are facing on the farm and worked on a project to understand the role of winter cover crops in farm drought resiliency. After completing a master’s degree in Sustainability Science and Environmental Studies at Lund University in Sweden, researching farmer adoption of practices which mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from arable soils in the Netherlands at Wageningen University, Anna started a PhD in Earth System Science at Stanford University, now studying farm carbon and nitrogen cycling, soil water management, and circular crop nutrients.

rice_thresher_2022_50,"ByAndrew Cormack3/1/22 10:55pm ​​Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. A successful organization is far more than just a sum of its parts. As a leading institution, Rice likes to prides itself on its diverse and integrated community. Keeping with Rice’s future-paving spirit, faculty, staff and students all ought to be compensated sensibly. Rice University’s recent minimum wage hike is a step in the right direction for some employees, but falls short in securing reasonable pay for student workers. President David Leebron announced that Rice willimplement a $15 minimum wageat the start of the 2023 fiscal year, and I wholeheartedly support that decision. It’s well timed and helps elevate Rice as an institutional leader. Food, gas and housing have become considerably more expensive in the past couple of years. Labor shortages have forced many employers in Houston to raise their starting pay to attract new workers. By raising minimum pay from $11.50, Rice is a more competitive employer that will be able to fill vacancies quicker and attract more qualified applicants. In reality though, the minimum wage increase is effectively a symbolic gesture. It helps reinforce Rice’s forward-thinking image, but it only raises pay for a very small subset of Rice workers. Because of annual seniority raises, most already make more than 15 dollars per hour. New hourly Housing and Dining and groundskeeping employees may benefit from the raise, but most on-campus workers making under 15 dollars per hour will be students. Counterintuitively, neither the current $11.50 or new $15 minimum apply to student workers. I understand that there is a lot of nuance with student employment: there are students working at student-run businesses, blanket tax organizations, academic departments, university facilities, the admission office, etc. Implementing a student minimum wage hike would be logistically challenging and likely cost prohibitive. Going from $9.50 — the starting pay at Rice Coffeehouse and many student-run businesses, to $15 per hour for hundreds of student workers could impact already exorbitant tuition costs. But how can Rice really tout a minimum wage that doesn’t apply to the entire Rice community? I’m a lifeguard at the Rec Center – a job that requires some level of skill and a certification. Along with my colleagues, I’m paid $9.25 an hour. Over the past eight months the Rec has struggled to attract new lifeguards. Just the other week my manager couldn’t get a shift filled – even with possible double pay. A shortage of workers prompted my manager to give out giant, candy-filled gift baskets to lifeguards that refer a new employee to the Rec. Other student workplaces have had similar difficulty attracting new workers. As Rice pats itself on the back for its new 15 dollar minimum wage, many student workers are left feeling demoralized and put off by on-campus work. It seems that because of COVID-related budget challenges, Rice postponed plans to give raises to student workers – leaving most at $9.25 an hour. How an organization pays its workers says a lot about how it values their employees and the work they do. In general, current pay is simply uncompetitive and student workers will find better work opportunities beyond the hedges. Though I enjoy lifeguarding at the Rec, I myself have reluctantly jumped to an off-campus job that pays more. Freezing raises and ignoring student pay is not sustainable. It isn’t in line with Rice’s spirit. Rice prides itself on its great community. Our faculty are passionate, our administration is accessible, our staff are exceptional and our students are involved. If we want to stick with our institutional values, Rice will put its money where its mouth is and develop a coherent plan for student pay. There are a lot of roads Rice can take to prove itself as progressive institution of higher learning, but fair student worker compensation is essential. Rice could phase in a $15 student minimum wage, award productivity bonuses or offer a seniority raise. Put simply – Rice needs to signal its commitment to everyone who works on campus, including students. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_54,"My freshman year, I ran across a soggy, wet poster, taped to an announcement board in the Yard. “Life Matters,” it read. A few days later, I attended the conference of this name: a life-transforming public conversation featuring guest speaker Cornel R. West ’74, whom I had never heard of before the event. An unashamed Christian and an unflinching Democratic Socialist, West beautifully orated the meaning of love, the necessity of refusing to conform, and the radical-revolutionary power of Jesus Christ, which required him to love “the least of these.” He coupled his love for Christ with a resistance to homophobia, to inequality, to white supremacy and militarism, in a way I had never heard before. He put Harvard’s two sides, the school at its best — a place that develops and challenges students to think outside of the box and imagine a new, more just world — and at its worst — a merch-producing, “Harvardite”-creating school emblematic of social stratification, global exploitation, and superficial “learning” — at odds, uplifting its better side. These ideas were all new to me. In 1918, my great grandfather, Chester Morgan, traveled to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to establish the first Church of God in Christ in the state. Years down the road, Colorado Springs would grow to become the evangelical world’s “Christian mecca.” It hosted a wide range of conservative faith-based organizations. My mother grew up in the historically Black Church of God in Christ, but in exploration of her own faith, turned to what was available in the surrounding, white-evangelical world. She found refreshing theology and a new angle that seemed more systematic, with more emphasis on scripture and seemingly less unnecessary rules and regulations. I grew up as a Black church boy transplanted in white churches. My Christianity — though it emphasized salvation by grace through faith, as a beautiful gift separate from anything one could earn — took on a white, conservative worldview. I quickly learned the rules of some white, non-denominational churches. Topics of race? Insignificant. God didn’t see color. We needed to talk out against abortion and same-sex marriage instead. This so-called “Christian worldview” was venomous. As I grew in knowledge, my autonomy, my perspective — subconsciously, perhaps — was diminishing. In a new, racialized way, I re-learned the legalism my mom so desperately ran from at my age. So long as I didn’t handle that, touch those, or, God forbid, look at that, I would be fine. The only problem was, too often, the unspoken “that” was tied to just existing. I learned the subtle delicacies which I — a tall Black boy at the time — had to follow for acceptance. Thus, when I heard Cornel West speak — being the Bible-quoting, politically startling, free, intellectual Black man that he is — I was shaken to the core. He helped me see that I could both be a Black Christian and hate homophobia. I could be a Black Christian and be race-conscious. I could be a Black Christian and call out injustice. I could be confident, even if it made others uncomfortable. And, as a matter of fact, it wasn’t just that I could be — it was that I should be. This way of Christianity seemed more real to me. The following semester, I enrolled in African and African American Studies 10: “Introduction to African American Studies” with Professor West. The class introduced me to one of West’s favorite Greek words, “paideia”: a deep, painful educational experience that requires death to oneself. The type of education that makes us question who we are. I remember reading the three “pillars” of the class: Lorraine Hansberry, W. E. B. Du Bois, and James Baldwin, and finally seeing my feelings and experiences fleshed out on paper and pen. I brought the books home to my mother, who had read them, but long ago, and watched as she re-awakened. We left my church and helped start a new booming, multi-ethnic, justice-oriented church in Colorado Springs. Then, Cornel West requested to be reviewed for tenure. Shockingly, it wasdenied. He left. In unflinchingly speaking out on behalf of the oppressed, Cornel West found himself in trouble with Harvard. In aninterviewwith The Crimson, West rightly identifies himself as an “undisciplinable” — one who refuses to conform to an institution’s expectations — and that is just what he is. The fact that Cornel West is gone is a tragedy for current and future Black Harvard students, but it is no surprise. He did not belong here. But in his leaving, Professor West left a flame just bright enough to kindle prophetic fire in those students ready to answer the call and hold Harvard to its better side, envisioning a brighter future.

(Illustration by Molly Cline |Daily Wildcat Every two years, the House of Representatives holds a new election cycle, and every six years the Senate holds their elections. These cycles give constituents a chance to vote for the candidate of their choice. Each vote is a contribution to the election system and a chance to have your voice heard. Your district representative and two state senators work for you. Your vote put them where they are now, so why shouldn’t they listen to what you want? As your representative or your two state senators, they aren’t meant to work in their own personal interests (even if they do . They are meant to listen to their constituents — also known as you! However, it is our responsibility to let them know what issues are important to us and how we want them to vote in the Senate or House. Writing a letter of concern or support towards a particular piece of legislation is a way to hold our elected officials accountable in their positions. This may seem daunting at first, but with a three-step guide, it can take less than 5 minutes to have your voice heard. First, who do we contact?: The representative that encompasses Tucson is Rep.Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz. If you are a resident of Pima County, she is your voice in the House of Representatives. However, if your voting residency is in another district or state you can look up your representativehere. The two Arizona state senators are Sens.Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., andMark Kelly, D-Ariz. Second, what do we want to address?: There are hundreds of House bills and Senate bills being discussed every day in the Arizona state legislature. If you hear about an issue or piece of legislation happening in Arizona, there’s a bill for that. You can look up specific bills you are invested inhere. In your letter, you want to address a specific either Senate or House bill by number, ex: SB1000 or HB1000. Third, how do we format our letter?: In my opinion, you want to keep it concise. You may not receive a response to your letter, the actual elected official may not even read it. However, at least a desk assistant will tally up all the letters of the day and alert the elected official about how many letters of support and concern they received about a certain bill, so every letter matters. Afree letter format resourcefrom North Los Angeles County Regional Center shows how to clearly outline your letter in a respectful and concise way. If mailing a letter doesn’t seem like something you would want to do, a phone call is an alternative. All elected officials can receive phone communication, however, you will most likely be speaking with a desk assistant. I recommend still writing your letter, and then reciting it on the phone to the desk assistant. This will help you keep your thoughts organized, concise and respectful. Emailing is another option for some elected officials, but not all of them. Kelly has anemail formand Sinema has anemail formas well. However, Kirkpatrick does not. Your email should follow the same format as your letter. Your elected officials work for you. They are in the position they are in today because of voters. Make your voice heard and have your elected officials listen to you. Follow Maayan Cohen onTwitter Maayan Cohen (she/her is an opinions reporter and a sophomore majoring in digital journalism.

thetech_mit_2022_26,"As alumni, we receive numerous communications from MIT. Many of these tout research projects that purport to combat global warming, and most of them target the reduction of CO2 output through projects related to renewable energy and vehicle electrification. These efforts are well-intentioned but ineffective. MIT’s own interactive climate model,En-ROADS, shows that even withmaximal worldwideadoption of wind turbines, solar panels, and electric cars, the temperature rise would be abated by only about 0.3ºC and that temperatures at the end of the century (i.e. 80 years from now, when most of today’s students will already be dead will still be higher than they are now. And if the interventions are limited to America and a few other Western nations, the decrease in expected warming will be even less — essentially negligible. This is a scant payoff for all the time, money, and brainpower that is being invested. MIT could have a larger and more immediate impact by providing strong support for research in two areas. The first area is direct CO2 removal and sequestration. This is done by drawing in air through giant fans, chemically removing the CO2, and storing it underground. This is currently being done on a small scale at an operating plant in Iceland that removes 4,000 tons of CO2 per year. This demonstrates feasibility but would have to be scaled up dramatically to make a dent in the 36 billion tons of CO2 emitted worldwide each year. But direct CO2 removal is one of the few ways that we can actuallyreducethe amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. When more CO2 is removed than is generated, temperatures will begin to fall. The second possibility is climate engineering. This would be a purposeful effort to mimic the effects of volcanoes. Large volcanic eruptions put into the upper atmosphere millions of tons of ash and sulfur dioxide that partially block sunlight from reaching the earth and thereby produce an immediate cooling effect. The Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991 resulted in a substantial cooling effect for the next couple of years. And the Tambora eruption in 1815 caused snow to fall in Virginia on the Fourth of July in 1816. Both of these approaches require significant research and development. The cost of direct CO2 removal must decrease by well over 90% to be affordable. But this is comparable to the achieved cost reduction of solar panels over the last 30 years. Climate engineering requires even more study. How do we do it effectively, and how could we measure and minimize any adverse effects of releasing chemicals into the atmosphere? It doesn’t have to be done all at once: the approach could be to try a little, measure the effects, and make whatever modifications are needed. Whatever downsides there are must be weighed against the downsides of doing nothing — or at least nothing effective. Spending hundreds of billions of dollars on wind turbines, solar panels, and electric cars will make no perceptible difference in global warming during our lifetimes. Would an intense and highly focused research and development program on direct CO2 removal and climate engineering not be a better investment of resources? These measures do not require worldwide cooperation and could be effectively implemented by the U.S. and our allies acting alone. The Apollo Project was announced in 1961, and eight years later, men stood on the moon. Could CO2 sequestration and climate engineering produce globalcoolingin our lifetimes? If you believe in science and can do the math, it’s possible. Tom Hafer ’70Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Henry Miller ’69Biology"
crimson_2022_106,"Four years ago, I kayaked through a needlessly intense military checkpoint on Nicaragua’s Río San Juan. Once beyond firing range, my clearly anxious guide whispered to me that anyone who criticized Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega would face “big trouble.” More recently, I sat in the Sanctum, a Cambridge room home to The Harvard Crimson’s Editorial Board, and listened as my peers opined passionately on a topic that has much of the journalistic world up in arms — a recentNew York Times editorialthat frets over the state of free speech in America. The dissonance between these two concerns pains me. While citizens of other countries face state-sanctioned attacks on their speech, we find ourselves amid a fabricated culture war whose primary effect is to denigrate the American model of liberalism and civil discourse. With every “radical right” attack on the “woke mob” (or vice versa , the U.S. strays from its principles and indirectly tells the world that a fragmented public forum wherein participants cannot even agree on the rules of gameplay is the free-speech gold standard. Unless resolved, the repressed in other parts of the world will suffer further. In the Age of Information, these seemingly self-contained conflicts on social issues like speech do not occur in a vacuum. Each time a blue-checkmarked Twitter user calls for the resignation of an editorial board for essentially arguing, ifdisingenuously, that free-flowing discourse is good, the world watches and takes note. The poison of our culture war will diffuse across borders and damage the value of liberalism abroad, undermining social movements against anti-democratic regimes. Why should a Russian citizenfight for freedomfrom Kremlin repression if the battered American example is as good as it gets? Byproducts of this nationwide divide on free speech also catalyze dangerous institutional change. When one side grows frustrated with the deadlock, it might engage with a sympathetic governing institution to bring about more hardline, irreversible adjustments to the rules of public discourse. For example, the Harvard Undergraduate Councilformally movedlast October to request that Harvard College conduct a thorough review of its 30-plus-year-old Free Speech Guidelines. The current guidelinesprotectthe dissemination of all ideas short of expressing “grave disrespect for the dignity of others,” including those that might be “noxious.” Given the relatively (and rightfully open nature of these rules, it feels unlikely that such a review would result in anything other than stricter institutional censorship. Just as American ideals might offer a guiding light to populations in pursuit of broader civil liberties, Harvard often serves as a leader for other universities across the U.S. and for the international community. Any move by our peers to pursue abandoning the natural, baked-in societal mechanisms for the defeat of noxious ideas in favor of more stringent institutions should elicit great concern. A similar story is playing out at the University of Virginia, another undergraduate community on the free-speech front lines. After a student op-edlamentedthe shunning of unpopular opinions — including conservative voices — on campus, the Editorial Board of the university’s newspaper published a reactionary editorial,statingthat they “refuse to condone” allowing former vice president Mike Pence to speak at UVA. This forswearing of uncomfortable discourse is a lost opportunity. His politics aside, 74.2 million Americans voted for Pence’s ticket some 17 months ago, so even hostile listeners could learn something about American democracy through a speaker event (or reaffirm the validity of their own beliefs in collision with his . The long-run international problem here is not the “canceling” of conservative opinions nor “dangerous” rhetoric in college campus “safe spaces.” These buzzwords merely represent alternate readings of constitutionally protected freedoms, unsightly as they may be. It is the rejection of pluralism that results from vicious bickering over the “true” tenets of free speech which threatens our global community the most. I pray that throughout this so-called reckoning, the left and right do not forget their most vital commonality — a commitment to preserving the health of civil discourse, both among American citizens and in our influence abroad. To those free-speech activists rising up against undemocratic regimes in other countries, it would be advisable to find another liberal model for now. Here in the U.S., we’re still figuring out what we think of ours. Peter N. Jones’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Weld Hall."
state_press_2022_73,"Jared Taylor caminando por el campus de Tempe de ASU acompañado por la policía el viernes 2 de septiembre de 2022. El 2 de septiembre, elconocido supremacista blancoy autoproclamado defensor de los blancos Jared Taylor pronunció un discurso titulado Si no hacemos nada: una defensa de la política de identidad blanca, presentado porCollege Republicans Unitedde ASU. El evento, organizado en una de las salas de conferencias más grandes de ASU, no sorprendió a los estudiantes de ASU al tanto de la historia de perpetuación del fanatismo de ASU. La administración de ASU no debe promover un discurso intolerante, porque apunta a las comunidades minoritarias y perpetúa la supremacía blanca en el campus. Si bien es un logro ser clasificada como una de lasmejores universidades por promover la libertad de expresión, este logro se ve empañado por el hecho de que parece significar que ASU continuará promoviendo el racismo y la supremacía blanca mientras ignora las necesidades y demandas de los estudiantes. Taylor es un defensor del realismo racial, una pseudociencia racista que sostiene la creencia de que ciertas razas son inferiores o superiores a otras. Ha promovido la creencia de que Estados Unidos debe seguir siendo predominantemente europeo y blanco. No es de extrañar que su presencia en ASU fuera recibida con la condena y las críticas de una variedad de estudiantes. Otras organizaciones estudiantiles, incluida laASU Women s Coalition,Young Democratic Socialists of AmericayStudents for Justice of Palestine, apoyaron una declaración que condenaba el evento y pidieron a la administración de ASU que prohibiera a Taylor hablar en el campus. Los grupos también pidieron que la administración dejara de reconocer a CRU como una organización estudiantil y emitiera una disculpa por permitir que se promueva la supremacía blanca en el campus. ASU tiene un historial de albergar oradores problemáticos y racistas. Apenas el año pasado, CRU recibió al nacionalista blanco y negador del holocausto Vincent James Foxx. En el 2015, el profesor asociado de la School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Robert Poe, apoyó a un compañero profesor que fue atacado por supremacistas blancos por dar clases sobre la teoría crítica de la raza. Aunque él y otros miembros de la facultad mostraron preocupación por la seguridad del profesor que estaba siendo atacado, la administración pareció permanecer en silencio, dijo Poe. Definitivamente querían que desapareciera en ese momento. No querían la publicidad o la publicidad negativa sobre la Universidad, dijo Poe. Poe dijo que el problema no es libertad versus discurso de odio, sino que ASU promueve ideales intolerantes como la supremacía blanca y el neonazismo. El debate entre lo que cuenta como discurso de odio y lo que es libertad de expresión protegida es difícil de navegar, pero está claro que la administración de ASU no ve los problemas que surgen al permitir que la intolerancia tenga una plataforma. Parece que ASU está más preocupada por proteger a los nacionalistas blancos que no están afiliados a la escuela que por brindar un entorno seguro para sus propios estudiantes. Los estudiantes han continuamente mostrado incomodidad y condena de eventos como estos, solo para ser recibidos con silencio y complacencia por parte de la administración de ASU. El presidente de ASU, Michael Crow, emitió recientemente una declaración sobre el evento, afirmando que es su opinión personal que las ideas particulares que defiende Jared Taylor no tienen cabida en el avance de la democracia estadounidense. Sin embargo, Crow promociona que la política de libertad de expresión de ASU protege a Jared Taylor y otros oradores invitados. En la introducción al discurso de Taylor, el fundador de CRU, Richard Thomas, agradeció a Crow por hacer todo lo posible para permitir que se llevara a cabo el evento. Me gustaría expresar mi aprecio por Arizona State University, dijo Thomas. Entendiendo que la administración estuvo bajo una presión muy considerable al tratar de cancelar este evento, y se mantuvieron firmes. Eso es inusual en estos días. Cuando hay una gran cantidad de protestas por parte de estudiantes, clubes y profesores, la administración de ASU no cumple con su deber como institución educativa al guardar silencio continuamente sobre asuntos relacionados con la supremacía blanca, lo que deja a las comunidades de ASU vulnerables y desprotegidas. La administración de ASU necesita repensar cómo abordan estas situaciones para que no se basen en la intolerancia. Editado por Sadie Buggle, Grace Copperthite, Sophia Balasubramanian y Piper Hansen.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_8,"A viralTikTok videoposted by Rachael Kevin (@shesbrewing shows the Kardashian family enjoying an otherwise empty ride at the Mad Tea Cup attraction at Disneyland in Anaheim as other guests waited 30 minutes for their turn. It turns out that Disneylandshut downthe ride for everyone but the Kardashians, who paid$2,975 for a VIP tour of the park and priority access to ridesto celebrate the fourth birthday of Khloe Kardashian’s daughter, True. While the Kardashians deserve their fair share of the blame, Disneyland has a bigger responsibility to serve its customers — who understandably may feel cheated out of their money after the company closed their rides. Unfortunately, this incident is not isolated, butpart of a patternin which Disneypursues profitwhiledisregarding ethics. Although the Kardashians’ desire for privacy and protection from the public is valid, there is something maddeningly ironic in making the poorer public wait for well-off celebrities. Why should those with lesser means serve those who are obscenely rich? In a perfect world, the rich would use their wealth to help the poor instead of giving themselves an advantage over the common people. The Kardashians could have easily simultaneously protected themselves and ridden alongside others had they brought along a security guard, as rapperCardi B did. Ultimately, despite their role as influencers, the Kardashians do not have the same duty toward the public as Disneyland does because, in giving the theme park money out of their own pockets, the public is entitled to its services. In closing rides that the public paid for and rightfully expected to enjoy without disturbances, much of the blame rests on Disney’s shoulders. While charging nearly $3,000 seems like a good business decision, it is ethically wrong. That much money should entitle someone to extra benefits, like hotel rooms near Disneyland. However, it should not disrupt the experience of someone who specifically paid money for the same ride, and accordingly, was promised its availability. Both the customer who paid $3,000 and the customer who paid $200 deserve access to the Mad Tea Cup. This is one of Disneyland’s more minor slip-ups. Interestingly, the “Happiest Place on Earth” has a history of not-so-happy incidents, many of which are documented in David Koenig’s book “Mouse Tales.” Whether it’s “a case on for 10 years if they have to,”cutting wages of workers in 1984or “tirelessly working to uphold the squeaky clean, All American, fun for the whole family image since 1955,” Disneyland has done much to suggest that it cares more about the money than the people who help generate it. In the most shocking example Koenig provides, 28-year-old James O’Driscoll stabbed 18-year-old Mel Yorba for harassing his girlfriend in 1981. A park nurse then rushed Yorba in a Disneyland First Aid van due to, according to Koenig, anunwritten policyprohibiting the calling of an ambulance “on stage,” because it “might detract from other guests’ enjoyment of the park.” However, the incident resulted in Yorba’s death because the van contained no lifesaving equipment, and the nurse drove to the closest hospital, even though multiple medical facilities trained in handling these types of emergencies were a mile farther. Disneyland evidently did not care for either Yorba or the “enjoyment” of their guests. They were afraid that a gruesome accident on their property would lead to bad publicity and “shatter their image,” as Yorba’smother put it. Evidently, their concern lay in how the incident would affect their profits rather than the life of a young man. The park is still associated with controversy today, with the most recent one taking place in April of this year. The integrity of “The Tenaya Stone Spa” in Disneyland’s California Resort wasquestioned in a reportsuggesting that the rocks used are sacred to Indigenous people. Not only does Disneyland completely disrespect Indigenous spirituality, but it also insults the intelligence of its guests, who may be Indigenous, by tricking them into believing that the rocks have been ethically sourced. Disneyland clearly cares more about the profit that the stolen rocks provide than morals or the guests themselves; to them, guests are cash cows. The solution is not to boycott Disney. Understandably, for many families, the park is a dream destination. However, the company should face more pushback in the form of protests or activism against Disney’s ultra-capitalistic disregard for ethics — both online and in real life. Until the park attains ethics and morals, its guests’ frustration will not stop. Mariam Jawhar is an Opinion Intern for the spring 2022 quarter. She can be reached atmjawhar@uci.edu."
crimson_2022_7,"At my first ever Harvard lecture, my first ever time attending class in college, the professor walked in front of the room, peered across the hall, and declared with frustration that he hated this unspecified “thing.” As the echo of my professor’s disdain rang through the room, a few of my classmates nodded in understanding. Others chuckled in agreement. I, on the other hand, sat blankly, puzzled. It took me a few seconds to comprehend what he was referencing. As an international student from a country that has worn masks long before the Covid-19 pandemic, I didn’t realize that face coverings could be so upsetting. Let me backtrack. Hi, my name is Eric. I’m a Korean American freshman who has spent the past five years living in Korea. For context, masks were a part of Korean society long before the days of Covid-19. Particularly in the capital city of Seoul, harmful microparticles canconcentratein such high levels that your throat and lungs hurt when breathing in deeply. On particularly bad nights, I’ve seen car headlights cut across air pollutionso thickit looks like there is snow or fog in the atmosphere. As such, the first time I remember wearing a mask is years ago, when my ever health-conscious dad shoved a N95 mask into my hands and told me to avoid going outside that day. Perhaps the N95 was overkill, but the idea of a mask itself was not. Even before the pandemic, the streets of Seoul were flooded with face coverings on days with bad pollution, and my school’s nurse would always keep some extra on hand in case a student requested one mid-day. Air pollution might have been the most common reason for wearing a mask in pre-pandemic Korea, but it certainly wasn’t the only one. Korean celebrities wore them when going out without makeup or to avoid being conspicuous in public (although they were sometimesrecognizedanyways . Even outside the world of K-pop, Koreansthrew onmasks when they felt bloated in public or could not be bothered to look nice for a run to the local convenience store. At one point, wearing a mask was even ateenage fashion trend. Even before the pandemic, it was common courtesy toweara mask when in public while sick. So when Covid-19 hit Korea last year, masks were not a new, alien concept like they were in the U.S., and accordingly, there wasn’t substantialresistanceto nationwide mask mandates. In fact, wearing masks quickly became the public standard. Not donning a mask in public — even outdoors —attracteddisdainful glares and astonished double takes from people walking by. Thanks to Korea’s normative mask culture prior to the pandemic, face coverings were never a political issue; they were merely common sense, and this attitudesaved liveswhen Covid-19 arrived. It will again if, knock on wood, another airborne pathogen spirals into a pandemic in the future. This is not to say that Koreans don’t find masks annoying; trust me, we do. I, myself, am not immune to the joyous relief of slipping my mask down as I walk along the Yard between classes, and I can still remember ignoring my dad’s first few attempts to get me to wear the aforementioned N95. I’ve had conversations with friends from both Korea and the U.S. about the obnoxious way that breathing into a mask can fog up glasses. Koreans do believe masks are cumbersome, just as Americans do. The difference is that masks are normalized in Korean society, and they have been for a long time. That’s why I’m surprised by how many Americans seem to look for every excuse to slip off their face covering. My professor’s eagerness to throw away his mask and forget about it forever as soon as possible was just unfathomable to me. In accordance with this antipathy for masks, it seems like a large number of Americans believe that masks will be completely erased from society when the pandemic is over. As someone who came from a country that normalized masks: I urge you to reconsider. I promise, having masks around without a pandemic will not cause the sky to fall down. It was not the end of the world for us, and it will not be for you either. Whether you live in an area with bad air quality, want to protect your friends from your cold while studying together, or have the same fashion sense as a Korean middle schooler and just want to look cool, there are legitimate reasons to wear masks besides Covid-19. A normalized masking culture would prepare the U.S. for potential public health emergencies in the future, just as Korea’s past experience with face coverings braced it for Covid-19. So, I’m sorry, professor. I agree that masks are annoying, but they deserve a place in life even after the pandemic. Eric D. Hwang ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Stoughton Hall."
stanforddaily_2022_28,"Content warning: this article contains references to rape and sexual assault. I read the same campus-wide alert as you last weekend. I was at a small gathering for my friend’s birthday when the email came in, and as soon as I saw the opening line about potentially triggering content, I knew exactly what it was about. What it’s always about. The survivor side of me did not want to know, because I did not think I was capable of handling being retraumatized by the contents of the email; but, the activist side of me, who co-leads the student group Sexual Violence Free Stanford (SVFree , knew that I needed to be informed of exactly what was in it in order to be a better representative for students. “As required by law, a mandated reporter notified Stanford DPS that an adult female reported having been sexually assaulted by an adult male. The victim indicated she was working in her office when a man came into her office, grabbed her, dragged her into a basement, and raped her. The victim does not want to provide a statement to law enforcement about the crime at this time.” I spent the next 48 hours in a trance, reliving the painful details of my own campus assault from more than a year ago, and of the trauma that Stanford as an institution had inflicted on me through its lack of acknowledgement and action. One thought remained constant in my mind: I know that Stanford will never recognize that they are at fault for the indescribable pain that many survivors have to learn to grasp and to live with. Our school, as I have come to know in my two years here, has become ahunting ground for perpetratorsbecause of deeply-rooted systemic issues in Stanford’s approach to the issue of campus rape, from the very acknowledgement of the existence of this phenomenon to the school’s lack of accountability for perpetrators. I believe the main reason why such horrific acts of rape continue to happen here, such as Friday’s assault or the previous one reported in Wilbur parking lotin August, is because Stanford has created a structure in which, at every step of the way, you as a student and as a survivor stand absolutely no chance against the institution’s power, influence, and desire to hold onto both of those things at the expense of students’ lives. I share my full story of assault here today, for the first time in my life, because I want to make sure that everyone knows that the failures of the system are really not failures at all — they are calculated and desired outcomes for a university that relies on silencing survivors in order to protect its reputation, and the reputation of all those associated with it. I would begin by offering more context for my story, but the truth is that the moments leading up to the assault do not matter all that much. They were like those before most assaults here at Stanford — assaults which activists believe to be least in the hundreds every year. It was during my freshman year. I had been at a party with all of my friends. Although my friends wanted to keep partying, I knew that I had had enough to drink and should be going home. A guy who I knew, who lived in my dorm and who was friends with many of my friends, offered to walk me home so that I would “be safe.” Instead of walking me to my room, he led me to his. These particularities, however, don’t matter as much as the broader context of my assault: a school that, even before I enrolled or arrived on campus, was infamous for its culture of sexual assault and institutional betrayal. A school where40% of female studentswill experience nonconsensual sexual contact before the end of their undergraduate career. A school oftwoexpulsionsfor sexual assault in its 130+ years of history. A school for violent offenders, who want to hurt, who hate women, who always get what they want having never taken no for an answer and who know that at Stanford they can get away with it, because so many have succeeded before them. It hurt really badly. I passed out. He did not use protection. The day after could have been a textbook response. I have been working in sexual violence prevention and survivor advocacy for years and knew the process very well, so I acted accordingly, robotically even. It was, however, the institutional response that I received which completely eliminated any chances of what could have been the beginning of an important healing process. As soon as I woke up, I took a Plan B pill and called Vaden Health Center. I calmly told them that I had been raped and I listed my needs: a pregnancy test, STI testing and someone to check for any injuries. The representative on the other end of the line, however, dismissed those concerns, and instead told me to hold while they transferred me to CST — Stanford’s Confidential Support Team, a counseling service built specifically for survivors of sexual assault. After waiting for what seemed like an eternal five minutes to the sound of elevator music, the director of CST took my call: “Would you like to do a Zoom call?” I hung up. I knew that these first moments after an assault were critical, so I went directly to the Stanford Hospital emergency room. They, if anyone, had to know how to properly care for me and treat me, right In 2018, Stanford University’s President, Marc Tessier-Lavigne,signed a documentstating that Stanford Hospital was going to implement changes to its sexual assault survivor intake procedures, to prevent retraumatization: there would be private waiting rooms for survivors of sexual assault; a designated site for SAFE exams (rape kits ; private showers for survivors of sexual assault; and a designated nurse for the triage process, to prevent survivors from having to share their story multiple times with ER staff. These changes, according to the document,would have come into effect in 2019. In June 2021, when I made my way into the Stanford Hospital ER, none of it was true. For an hour, I waited in the public waiting room next to a victim of a bike accident, who had skin hanging off from his face and arms. I told at least four different ER staff what had happened to me, in excruciating detail, before being taken into a room by one of the nurses, where I once again had to share the details of my assault. While the room was “private,” I could hear every conversation happening on the other side of the door, and can only imagine that my conversation, too, was audible from outside. Every single recounting just hurt me more and more. I told multiple nurses that I hadn’t had any water or food in nearly 24 hours and felt like I was going to pass out. They told me I still could not have either of those things, as they were waiting on doing more tests. Two hours passed with no tests, no food, no water. I had told my story five times by that point and had never felt more weak — physically and mentally, starving, thirsty and crying continuously. I was moved to a different room, where I expected to undergo a SAFE exam. A nurse gave me a fistfull of pills and one injection in the leg for STIs. Referring to my rapist, she told me that, if she could, she would “cut his dick off.” I threw up, then was brought a ham sandwich and a cup of water. I fell asleep for about an hour. My main reason for going to the ER was that I wanted to undergo my SAFE exam/rape kit, in the event that I would want to pursue a police investigation later on. I was told that the only nurse who could do this was an hour drive away from Stanford. The ER nurse put her phone to my ear, so that I could speak to the SAFE exam nurse directly. “If you want me to come, I can get in the car right now and be there in an hour,” she said.You should have gotten in the car as soon as I walked into the hospital. Overwhelmed, I told them that I needed to get out of there immediately. The ER staff discharged me after five hours without having ever done any tests, any rape kit, or even a brief check for any injuries. Just like Vaden and CST, the Stanford Hospital failed me too. When I was discharged, a Stanford Resident Fellow (RF was waiting for me in the public waiting room of Stanford Hospital. He had brought in a student for a leg injury and had been made aware of my being there after getting to the ER. He introduced himself, then proceeded to deliver another blow to my already tired and bruised body and soul: “Campus police has informed me that they are going to issue a campus-wide alert. Any moment now.” But no one, from the RF to the ER staff who had spoken to the police, knew what was going to be in the alert. How detailed would this be? Would my dorm’s name be in it? Would our class years be in it? Would the name of the party be in it? Would mine? I kept refreshing my Outlook inbox, waiting for the email. In my mind, anything was possible. I was exposed again, naked and vulnerable. Community Crime Alert –Reported Sexual Assault Type of Incident:Sexual Assault Date/Time of Incident:June 4th, 2021 (exact time unknown – timeframe begins soon after 1:30 AM Date Reported to DPS:June 4th, 2021 / 6:51 PM Location:Unspecified student residence on campus Additional Details:As required by law, a mandated reporter notified Stanford DPS that a female student reported having been sexually assaulted by a male, who is likely another student. The male walked the female to her residence from a party prior to the assault. I keep thinking of how many people saw this vague description and wondered if they, too, are at risk, if they might know the people involved or if they happened to have been at that same party. As a survivor advocate on our campus, I know very well that the Title IX investigation process can take many months and is generally excruciating, particularly because ofBetsy DeVos-era regulationssuch as scrapping the maximum 60 day requirement for investigations and allowing live cross-examination of survivors by their rapists’ representatives, such as friends or family. I would have still been willing to subject myself to that, though, if only I knew that I had my school and the Stanford Title IX office by my side. Unfortunately, I cannot think of any person that I’ve met during my two-plus years at Stanford who has had a positive experience with that office. I can tell you, though, about the many who have suffered, who have been victim-blamed by investigators, who have watched their rapists receive brief suspensions and walk at graduation: a constant reminder that their safety, wellbeing and courage do not matter even remotely as much as their rapists’ future. Likeover 70% of undergraduate women at Stanford, I had concerns about the institution’s ability to conduct a fair Title IX investigation and seek justice for me. I thought, realistically, there is no way this institution is going to change its standard practice for me. I thought, no matter how brave I am, their interests will come first, and the outcome will never be in my favor. Wanting to protect myself from being re-traumatized by the institution’s process, I did not start a Title IX investigation. To this day, the hurt and excruciating frustration from this decision lingers with me the most: seeking justice and healing should not come with the threat ofhaving to drop out, thoughts of suicide, or defamation lawsuits. Now, I am one less person on the annual Title IX report and one less survivor for Stanford to take responsibility for. I did not go home for the summer after the assault, because I could not look my parents in the eyes. I did not know how to, when I felt like my entire being, down to its very core, had been so fundamentally changed. In the fall of my sophomore year, I helped organize the “Stanford Protects Rapists” protest at Sophomore Convocation. Almost none of the people on stage, from the student speaker to the very president of our school, acknowledged our presence — the only mention of the protest came from Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Sarah Church, who asked usnot to block the parents’ viewduring the ceremony. In the livestream of the event and the official photos which came out after, there is no trace of our ten-foot long banner, or of any of the scores of sophomores who were helping hold it up over the span of two hours. In the eyes of the institution, we weren’t erased — we never even existed. Later in the year, I went to a party on campus and, while waiting in line to get in, I ended up witnessing my rapist read the mandatory “consent” banner at the entrance to the same party. I was reminded — not that I had really forgotten — how quickly people move on here, how little his life had been affected by what had happened, and how I will have to learn to just deal with frequently seeing him on my street, in my dorm, in the coffee shops I study in, in Instagram stories of events and at dinner tables with my friends. I saw a counselor and then a therapist, trying to deal with recurring nightmares from which I would wake up crying and screaming, recalling the details of that night. None of that counseling support came from Stanford. Over the next summer, I watched the reports of sexual assaults pile in my inbox. That kept happening in spite of the small number of people who were even on campus during that time. None of the reports or follow-up emails included any acknowledgement of the phenomenon of campus rape, or any information on how the school was going to truly deal with the roots of assault: sexism, homophobia, racism, a lack of consent and sexual education, and a long history of institutional efforts to cover up reports of sexual violence. I came back to Stanford this quarter in a better place, more hopeful, more healthy. Two weeks into the academic year, though, I stand here, fully reminded of every way in which this school has failed me, and in which they are going to fail recent victims too. I don’t want to buy pepper spray and pocket knives. I don’t want to have to pre-plan all of my steps and be walked home by someone every night. I don’t want to cry with my friends and my RAs anymore, hurting for each other but fully knowing that we have none of the power and resources needed to stop this from happening again. And I don’t want to be told that we should “stay safe,” “be aware of our surroundings” and “intervene if we see something or know something.” How evil do you have to be toactively showrapists that they are welcome here, and then turn to your students and tell them to start running and take cover? This week, when I put up a poster saying that Stanford protects rapists, a professor stopped me and said that I was going to get me in trouble, because I can only post in “designated areas.” And when I called CST, angry and telling them that I am overwhelmed with outrage for how this institution has betrayed survivors, the first question I was asked was “How is this affecting your school work?”. And at any point I can walk into the DLCL building on campus and be face to face with atenured professor who was found responsible for sexually harassing a student, and was accused by several more. And I give it a month at most before we get another email about another survivor that this school is going to fundamentally fail. I hold in me the exhaustion and pain of hundreds. Stanford protects rapists. Actively, knowingly, willingly, and with absolutely no remorse.

thetech_mit_2022_30,"Collective bargaining between MIT’s graduate student workers and administration is about to officially begin. Unfortunately, both sides are already off to a disappointing start. The administration and union organizers have been too focused on rhetoric and not enough on honesty. The best thing for MIT is to stop this one-side-versus-the-other mentality and instead work together to make an MIT-quality collective bargaining agreement. In a recent email, Chancellor Melissa Nobles and Provost Cynthia Barnhart made a promise of good-faith negotiations. The same email also included misleading facts and statements meant to intimidate student workers. When unfair academic policies facilitate discrimination and wrongful terminations, they are absolutely on the bargaining table. The days of unilateral policy making are coming to an end. Shame on Chancellor Nobles, Provost Barnhart, and anyone else that tries to oppress student workers using deception or threats. Some student union organizers are also attempting to deceive to get what they want. I’ve received carefully worded emails that were technically true but also misleading. I’ve been to organizing events that conveniently left out a few facts. I’ve spoken with organizers that wanted to win the election more than they wanted every student worker to vote. Shame on any union organizer that made a misleading claim or viewed a fellow graduate student worker as the opposition. A fair collective bargaining agreement will benefit everyone at MIT, but we are off to a pathetic start in achieving this goal. It’s time to forget about the student workers’ issues and the administration’s issues. We all need to work together to solve MIT’s issues. That is the best and fastest way for everyone to shift focus back to research. When our community works together, people around the world take notice. The institution that goes after problems like climate change and nuclear fusion had better be able to negotiate a fair union contract. Being honest, open to dialogue, and willing to compromise can soon result in a fair labor agreement. Using only methods we can be proud of, let s quickly sign a contract that will be the model for other universities to use. Now is the time for MIT to develop the world s best student union contract.

state_press_2022_65,"A law that would allow public funding to be used towards private school tuition has been put on hold due to protests. An Arizonaschool voucher expansion billhas recently gone into effect after thepetitionset out to contest it didn t receive enough signatures for a referendum. This move is yet another heavy blow to Arizona s struggling public school system. Worse than that, it s now a reflection of how Arizona lawmakers are restricting democratic processes in their efforts to undermine public education. For context, this isn t the first time expanding school vouchers has been on the table for Arizona. Jeanne Powers, a professor in theMary Lou Fulton Teachers Collegespecializing in school choice and segregation, said Arizona has a long-standing commitment to school vouchers. She brought upProposition 305, a similar proposed school voucher expansion backed by Republicans in 2017. Voters overwhelmingly rejected it, Powers said. Opposition to the recent school voucher expansion legislation has also been strong. While the petition received 141,714 signatures, only 88,866 were valid, falling short of the 118,823 minimum requirement. Powers believes the Arizona Legislature s decision to cut the allocated time for petitioners to gather signatures from 90 to 80 days played a big role in the petition s failure. When you change the playing field, it s kind of like voting restrictions, Powers said. You need to understand this policy within its broader context. The broader context Powers referred to is this year s ballot. In Arizona alone, there are three proposed restrictions on referendums, measures that enable a direct vote by the electorate on an issue, law or proposal. This form of direct democracy has recently led to expansions of liberal policies like Medicaid in Maine, Idaho, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Utah. This seemingly encouraged Republican-held legislatures to try to restrict referendums, a troubling trend reflected in Arizona s controversial school voucher debate. There s a difference between legislators commitment to schools and voters commitment to schools, Powers said. I think that s what you see with the success of the referendum campaign when things are taken directly to voters. According to Powers, this fundamental disconnect between parents and legislators priorities contributes to Arizona having one of the worst and most underfunded school systems in the country— and Arizona s school voucher expansion will likely depress funding even further. This is because school vouchers divest funding from public schools by making taxpayer money additionally subsidize private school tuition. In public schools, this leads to increased class sizes and fewer resources, such as decreased school counselors and nurses, textbooks, equipment and cutting music and athletic programs. Arizona s parents historically don t support school voucher expansion, and yet this bill has made it into law. Again, this is likely due to Gov. Doug Ducey reducing the time window for petition signatures, and the Arizona GOP s active efforts to undermine referendums. Since referendums are the most direct way we have a voice in the democratic process, this infringement is serious. Not only are Arizona Republican lawmakers turning their backs on public schools, but they re turning their backs on their constituents. Over 1.1 million students rely on Arizona public schools, and we need to do everything in our power as Arizona voters and students to make sure that they re represented in November.

crimson_2022_110,"When I received an email on March 21 from the Assistant Director of Student Services and Commencement Coordinator at Harvard Kennedy School about registering for the University-wide Affinity Graduation Ceremonies, I opened it with a sense of cautious optimism. Over the past few years, members of the Asian/Pacific Islander/Desi American (APIDA community at Harvard have been unable to escape the litany of anti-Asian hate incidents that predated, but were exacerbated by, the Covid-19 pandemic. In the wake of the Atlanta-area spa shootings in March 2021 that left eight people dead (including six women of Asian descent , a group of HKS studentsorganized a candlelight vigilto provide a space for reflection, education, and solidarity. There seemed to be growing acknowledgement of both the microaggressions and larger systemic obstacles that members of the APIDA community faced on a daily basis. In this context, a Harvard APIDA affinity graduation ceremony would serve as a respite of joy and connection before graduates left the Harvard bubble. I scanned the email for the full list of ceremonies: Black Graduation; Latinx Graduation; Next Gen (First Generation Low Income+ Graduation; Lavender (LGBTQ+ Graduation; and Native American and Indigenous Graduation. In total, five affinity graduation ceremonies were listed, but one specifically for APIDA students was not among them. That’s odd, I thought as I reread the list. The administration was usually competent at ensuring that emails addressed to the entire student body were vetted by a number of people for typos and factual inaccuracies before they were sent. I estimated that it would take two to three business days for a follow-up email to be sent with an updated total of six affinity celebrations and a short apology. That follow-up email never arrived. It slowly dawned on me that the omission of a Harvard APIDA affinity graduation ceremony in the March 21 email was not accidental — it was intentional. There would not be an APIDA affinity graduation ceremony, and I therefore didn’t need to create a hold in my calendar for one. Over the following weeks, I experienced a wave of different emotions. Anger was the first. Sadness quickly followed. Eventually, the overwhelming feeling that lingered was resignation. After all, the omission of the graduation ceremony fit into a larger American narrative that those in the APIDA community are model minorities who need few, if any, institutional services and resources. The model minority myth projects the idea that those within the APIDA community are uniquely capable among people of color of pulling themselves out of poverty without relying on costly social services from the government. This myth serves two purposes: It drives a wedge between APIDA and other BIPOC communities by pitting groups of color against one another, and it offers a convenient justification for largely ignoring the real social and economic needs of a diverse and heterogeneous population. In my hometown of New York City, for example, a2015 reportfrom the Asian American Federation found that while APIDAs make up close to 15 percent of the city’s population, only 1.4 percent of city-based agency contracts were awarded to Asian American social services providers over the past 13 years. This resource disparity persisted despite the fact that 20.8 percent of APIDAs in New York City lived below the city’s official poverty threshold of $36,262, according to a2019 city report. The racial disparities behind the allocation of social services in America’s largest city is a prominent example of how the model minority myth is put into practice. Myths are very difficult to dispel, particularly when they exist to reinforce the existing structures of power, privilege, and resource allocation in our society. What, then, can be done to address racial inequities on the Harvard campus? Drawing public attention helps, such as what Harvard College student Matteo N. Wong ’22did last yearon Twitter when the school gaslit APIDA students on its Anti-Asian Racism Resources webpage withan online postthat read in part, “You may wish that you weren’t Asian, but remember that your ancestors likely went through similar or even worse incidents.” After Matteo’s story was picked up bynational press outlets, the offending post was removed from the school’s webpage. In the spirit of One Harvard, a diverse coalition of student groups and organizations from across the graduate schools is petitioning the administration to dedicate an on-campus venue, staff, and financial resources to a graduation ceremony for APIDA-identifying graduates in 2022 and in subsequent years. To date, over 25 student groups and more than four hundred community members have signed thepetition. The unfortunate reality of American society today is that many APIDA graduates will face unconscious biases, microaggressions, and structural barriers to advancement in their lives due to their racial and ethnic identity. By working together to advocate for the needs of APIDA students, we can ensure these do not occur during this year’s Commencement festivities.

rice_thresher_2022_11,"ByThresher Editorial Board10/18/22 9:50pm Content warning: This piece contains references to suicide. This week, Izzie Karohl, a Rice alumna, wrote anopinion piece highlightingthe need to talk about mental health and suicidality in our community. We at the Thresher want to add to her piece and encourage students who are struggling with their mental health or suicidal ideation to reach out for help, whether from on- or off-campus resources. Reaching out for help can be terrifying, and those fears are often rooted in personal negative experiences with resources in the past or stories heard from peers – we don’t mean to minimize that with this editorial. Especially with students dealing with suicidal ideation, the fear of being involuntarily hospitalized is a real consideration. It’s a mental health complication that can be difficult to approach due to concern for a student who might harm themselves. We know that many students are hesitant to reach out, especially to campus resources, because of this fear and peers’ stories of being pushed into taking a leave of absence from Rice or even a concern that on-campus resources won’t be helpful for them. But no single experience is representative of all that a resource can provide, and the Counseling and Wellbeing Center is worth seeking help from. They’re accessible, they’re free and they’re right here on campus. This can be a benefit when compared to off-campus resources that may have lengthy wait times, require traveling off campus and can be costly, especially for low-income students. For students who prefer off-campus support, the Counseling Center’s care coordinator helps students navigate their insurance benefits — some cover as much as 75% — and has a list of off-campus providers who have worked with Rice students in the past. Some providers offer sliding scale pricing options for therapy, such as at the Montrose Center. Ultimately, any resource is better than none. A flawed resource is preferable to not reaching out for help, not being directed to help or considering a decision that you can’t take back. Karohl asked us all to talk about suicide, and she’s right. We need to. We also need to acknowledge the reality of what being suicidal means, and we need to emphasize the importance of encouraging students dealing with suicidal ideation and others struggling with their mental health to reach out to someone – anyone – for help. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_15,"The cities of Tehran and Kabul were once free, cosmopolitan capitals where women dressed as they pleased. My mother, an Afghan immigrant to the United States, speaks of these times fondly. But ever since the rise of authoritarian regimes in these countries, both Iran and Afghanistan have entered a dark period. Many of us at Harvard are aware of the protests that have erupted across Iran and the Middle East following Zhina Mahsa Amini’s death; some of us, myself included, have even rallied on the steps of Widener Library to call for justice for Amini. Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman of Kurdish descent, was detained by the Iranian morality police under the hijab law, which requires women to cover their hair under hijabs or headscarves and wear loose-fitting robes. She was taken into custody and reported dead three days later. There exist allegations that she was beaten during her detention, sparking widespread protests in Iran and beyond. The United States has previously launched efforts to aid the persecuted women of Iran’s Islamic Republic. These efforts, however, are facades for adeeper political agenda, intended to induce Iranian surrender to U.S. demands and economic coercion. The U.S. State Department has repeatedly placed a spotlight on the suppression of Iranian women’s rights, with social media posts reminiscing on an era where Iranian women dressed openly and offering belittling praise to successful Iranian-American women. The U.S. administration has long appropriated the Iranian women’s movement to further their own political and economic programs, while blatantly disregarding the oppression faced by women under Middle Eastern governments allied with the U.S. This is not the first or only occurrence of Western nations exerting their power in developing countries under the guise of empowering women. European colonial powers have long presented the hijab as a symbol of oppression in Asia and North Africa. In the 19th century, the British launched campaigns against the hijab in Egypt, fixated on the claim that it was an injustice against women. Such notions served as fundamental underpinnings of white saviorism, and also contributed to the development of misinformed conceptions of Middle Eastern and Muslim women. Both historical reflection and a deeper analysis of contemporary women’s rights propaganda reveal an important truth: These countries do not need saving. Muslim women do not need saving. Control of the female body and oppression of women is not inherent to Islam, nor the countries of the East. And Western intervention will most certainly not be the solution. Liberation is not equivalent to removal of the hijab. The dispute over the garment is rooted in its historically politicized nature, a narrative perpetuated by Western ignorance and propaganda. Islam’s deeper message about the hijab as a notion of modesty is drowned out by Western cultural assumptions that demonize the hijab as a tool of oppression and exploitation. To a Muslim woman, however, the hijab grants them control of their body. It serves as both a physical manifestation of a woman’s faith and a symbol of their personal commitment to lead a pure life. There are women residing in Iran who firmly believe in the virtue of their hijab, while there are also women who would give up their hijabs at once — if given the choice. Liberation, therefore, is equivalent to the ability to exercise this choice and bodily autonomy. The women’s movement in Iran runs much deeper than a piece of cloth covering the hair. It is rooted in a long-brewing exhaustion with authoritarian regimes that continue to deny women freedom and agency. Mahsa Amini’s death and the protests that have erupted in response are not a demonstration against Islam, but rather, the broader issue of policing a woman’s ability to choose — to choose to wear the hijab, however one pleases. As a Muslim woman of Persian heritage, I stand in solidarity with Mahsa Amini. I commend the Iranian women actively protesting and fighting for change, and for demonstrating purposeful resilience against authority that has historically politicized and policed women’s bodies. And I hope for a day where I can share my mother’s memories, a day where women truly embody the freedom they so rightfully deserve. As we, in Harvard, the United States, and the West, extend our support for the women in Iran, we must ensure we are fighting for this freedom of choice — not the Western notion of freedom from the hijab.

crimson_2022_147,"Little Red Riding Hood is a story many of us grew up with; a naive girl in her famed red hood sent off to deliver goodies to her sick grandma gets tricked and eaten by a wolf. Our parents thus instructed us to not be dumb and beware of strangers, or else we would be the next Little Red. But is it right to blame her for talking to the wolf? It seems as though she felt pressured to do so, as most people would have been given the presence of a literal beast blocking their path. Little Red’s story is, unfortunately, aperfect allegoryfor rape and the abuse of power by those in control of one’s future, like a menacing wolf or a sheep-clothed professor mentoring students. If not becoming the next Little Red was as simple as avoiding talking to strangers on campus, thenone in fivewomen would not get sexually assaulted during college. After all,85-90 percentof sexual assaults reported by college women are perpetrated by someone they knew, so not talking to strangers won’t cut it. This makes Harvard’s toxic networking culture so dangerous; how are we supposed to land that internship if we aren’t constantly interacting with people in power? Students are continuously placed in Little Red’s shoes when we are encouraged to naively navigate the woods of networking filled with monsters we should be able to trust. Networking is an essential skillstressedhere at Harvard. Whether through classmates or professors, there is an unwritten rule that we must expand our networks right away to be successful. Even for first-years, there’s no escaping academic advisors, upperclassmen, or the plethora of Harvard websites stressing its importance. Harvard’s culture of transactional relationships plagues our ability to prioritize our comfort zones and pushes us to strive for our best work, but not always in the best way. There’s nothing inherently wrong with networking. However, beyond having 500-plus LinkedIn connections or being on a first-name basis with your professor, networking’s toxic nature lies in the ambiguity defining student-professor relationships. When meeting someone well-respected, women, especially, need to make an effort to stand out: express interest through a smile, offer to help before being asked, or laugh at their jokes (even if they aren’t funny . Professors know we have to do this, but the nature of power imbalances continues to leave us vulnerable to wolves waiting along our paths. One of many wolves at Harvard is John Comaroff, whose reputation as a tenured professor was solid. He worked closely with graduate students, allegedly pressuring some to be closer with him than they wanted to. Three of these students bravely came after Harvard’s supposed sheltering of Comaroff with a lawsuit. The graduate students described the difficulties of navigating experiences that left them feeling uncomfortable while knowing that the success of their academic endeavors hinged in large part on the support of their faculty advisors. Comaroff was the wolf blocking their paths to their goals, holding them within his claws. Their future success was contingent on his control and thus their submission. Although there are some indicators that graduate students are more likely to be sexually harassed by professors, Harvard undergrads are conditioned to practice the same toxic networking habits that lead us down the same path. Just “saying no” only works if that is a viable option, and free will is near-void when a professor has so much power over one s post-graduate success. There is no doubt that power dynamics within systems of academia perpetuate Little Red’s story. Little Red was not dumb. She was a girl who felt her only choice was bending to the wolf’s will, like students here at Harvard. Little Reds should never be called dumb for wolves getting the better of them. The lawsuit iterates against the disgraced professor that “students rarely speak out about harassment or sexual misconduct because when they do, they risk their education and their careers.” The complaint filed against Harvard accuses the University of accommodating this culture when hiring Comaroff, choosing to overlook the history of sexual misconduct allegations against him at the University of Chicago “even when warned about it.” It was not until the lawsuit materialized that loud, public faculty cheers for Comaroff were withdrawn and he was held accountable. Harvard’s complacency and silence normalize power imbalances and are thus responsible for endangering students. In response to the lawsuit,73 professors wrotehow faculty should be demanding “more expedient, transparent, equitable, and independent investigative procedures” for future cases. As students, we couldn’t agree more. However, this only passively addresses the problem, as it implies there will indefinitely be more sexual misconduct cases to investigate. We must understand that the toxic networking culture at Harvard enables students to be taken advantage of and keeps us from speaking out – a truth that’s even more apparent withComaroff back teachingat the college this fall. Toxic networking has to go, so we never have to worry about replicating Little Red’s nightmare again – however, its inherently insidious nature makes it seem like a world free of it can only exist in a fairy tale.

state_press_2022_32,"Higher education today can t be discussed without mentioning innovation. Colleges have to stay relevant, sustainable and ahead of the game. ASU is doing a great job in contributing to the welfare of its community and to Arizona. This is why ASU stillremains No. 1 in innovation. ASU has kept its top spot in innovation by creating new technology to help improve the educational experience for students and teachers, as well as keeping students safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, we need to take ASU s title more seriously. When COVID-19 hit, students faced social change and unanswered questions. It wasn t a matter of attending classes and getting good grades. Professors had to keep students engaged and motivated to take online courses. Innovation played a crucial role in this. According to Dan Munnerley, co-executive director and lead design architect of Next Generation Learning, The last two months of ASU were when ASU really started taking those innovation steps and going places. Thinking beyond in-person and in-class learning, and starting with virtual spaces. Dreamscapeis ASU s way to bring virtual reality to all members of the community. The project starts with a virtual and interactive experience of introduction to biology and then expands across other disciplines. Enabling students to be creative with their learning and engage with it. ASU partnered with Dreamscape Immersive for this project. The innovation rankingcomes from college provosts, presidents and deans around the country.The Dreamscape project is a perfect example of why ASU keeps its innovation title. ASU is constantly coming up with new ideas and innovative projects that help the ASU community stand out. ASU is also one of the few universities that has achieved a platinumsustainability ratingfrom the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education. The University developed a program to lowercarbon emissionsand increase energy efficiency by using renewable energy. In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, ASU took matters into its own hands and decided to move beyond the nasal swab test by creating a saliva test. In times of unprecedented change, ASU has done a good job handling the pandemic. According toan articlefrom ABC15, ASU implemented free COVID-19 saliva test vending machines across its different campuses last year. Since October 2021, ASU has collected 1,093 gallons of saliva, has 34 devils drop-off sites across all four campuses. ASU also has 71 public testing sites through the Arizona Department of Health Services.ASU is one of the few universities that has been able to test students safely and effectively, giving parents,students and staff members peace of mindregarding their health. ASU s classes prepare students for a rapidly changing job market by giving them the tools to become leaders.According to ASU s website, it has obtained an institutional membership to theNational Center for Faculty Development & Diversity, an independent professional development, training and mentoring community for faculty members Innovation in education matches challenges with solutions. It brings out creativity and new ways of thinking for the community. Innovation is crucial for students in an ever-changing world. It encourages students and teachers to break boxes and uncover new truths. Sustainability graduate student and assistant Matthew Nock said ASU has helped him bring an innovative and creative approach to his studies. He likes that ASU isn t only focused on one thing but branches out to different areas and provides students and teachers with interdisciplinary learning. We are doing something similar in a different way, Nock said. So for instance, doing lab work involves sequence. There s an order in which you want to do things and that has to do with the internal validity or rigorousness of the study. Scientists are engaging in sequence. Choreographers are also engaging in sequence. Artists are also engaging in sequence. Teachers are engaging in sequence. Innovation enables the ASU community to come together and learn from each other. For students and teachers to step out of their comfort zone and explore new ideas and interests breaking out of boxes when it comes to education. There s a yes, and sort of mentality at ASU. Where if you say, I ve got this crazy idea, and I d like to do it, you re actually usually told yes, wherein other institutions that at least I ve worked in the answer hasn t been as positive to doing something really outside the box, said Heather Haseley, co-executive director and lead design architect of Next Generation Learning.

stanforddaily_2022_119,"— Bryce Huerta ’21 M.S. ’22 is a master’s student in mechanical engineering On Jan. 18, Stanford plans to resume in-person instruction after two weeks of online classes aimed at reducing the spread of the omicron variant among members of the student body. Yet, even now, community transmission is considered “high” by the CDC across all 50 states, and there is little certainty of the duration of the current wave. It is unclear whether or not it will truly subside before January ends. With the unique challenges presented by omicron, Stanford’s current mitigation strategies will not be enough to prevent dramatic community spread of COVID-19 that will disrupt classes and campus life. This statement is by no means an indictment of Stanford’s COVID reduction strategies — the University’s booster mandate will further protect students, faculty and staff against severe acute disease caused by the virus. Yet the seven-day positivity rate on campusjumped to 7.7%for the week of Dec. 27, up from 0.25% a month prior. Continued spread of COVID-19 at these same levels will render the University unable to function due to the large number of students and staff in quarantine. If the University intends to resume in-person learning this quarter, then further steps are necessary to ensure a safe campus for classes to commence. Unlike prior SARS-CoV-2 variants, omicron isfar more transmissible, having beencompared to measlesfor its ability to spread. Furthermore, omicron is anairborne virusthat can spread through small aerosols. To respond to such a rapidly spreading virus, the following adjustments are necessary: 1 Provide all students, faculty and staff with N95 respirators Given the spread of omicron through the air, loosely fitting masks will not provide protection against exposure. N95 respirators filter out95% of viral particles, hence the name. For such a rapidly spreading pathogen, cloth masks and even loose surgical masks will not be adequate to prevent community transmission. Thus, the University needs toprovide all students, faculty and staff with N95 respirators.Recently, the University has begun recommending that all students wear some form of N95, but to ensure the safety of the school, every member of the Stanford community should be provided with N95 masks. 2 Purchase HEPA filters for use in classrooms and living spaces Beyond just masks, Stanford must make a concerted effort to filter the air of viral particles in enclosed spaces. Thus, all classrooms, dormitories, residences and other indoor community spaces need to be provided with HEPA filters. Classrooms and especially dorms can be poorly ventilated — as such it is imperative now more than ever to clean the air so that students, faculty and staff will be breathing to prevent community transmission.Datafrom the U.K. has demonstrated the effective use of HEPA filters to remove detectable viral particles from the air in COVID wards. Furthermore, fans and other ventilation equipment should be used where necessary to cycle air through enclosed spaces. 3 Increase testing frequency and modify contact tracing protocols Currently, fully vaccinated students, faculty and staff are only required to test once per week. Due to theimmune-evasiveproperties of omicron, however, fully vaccinated and boosted people can still be infected and transmit the virus. As such, all students, faculty, and staff must do PCR testing at least twice per week and should ideally take a rapid test before entering any University building. With the transmission of omicron, the prior guidelines of close contacts must be updated as well. Gone are the days of 15 minutes of close contact being “high-risk.” Now, anyone who has any contact, even fleeting, with a COVID-positive individual should be considered at a high risk for exposure. Furthermore, buildings that have been visited by COVID-positive members of the community should be ventilated and filtered. The omicron variant has presented the newest challenge in the ongoing pandemic. The good news is that it is 2022, and the tools exist to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within our community. Stanford, however, must take decisive action now to implement such measures. Otherwise, the worst-case scenario of so many isolating students, faculty and staff triggering an unplanned shutdown creeps closer to becoming reality.

stanforddaily_2022_86,"Holden Foreman graduated from Stanford with a degree in computer science in 2021. He was Editor-in-Chief of The Daily’s 257th Volume. Foreman works as a software engineer on The Washington Post’s engineering team. For all its talk about mission and human-centered education, Stanford has largely ignored even the basics ofaccessibilityin its computer science curriculum. In fact, it wasn’t until an elective I took senior year (winter 2021 that I encountered any lessons on web accessibility as a computer science major. Apparently, Stanford does not see accessibility as something worth prioritizing. And this absence goes beyond computer science. Accessibility is something that Stanford should be teaching all its students. It is relevant to any career. Accessibility means something can be reached regardless of whether the user has a disability or not. Physical infrastructure must be built with accessibility in mind. You may have seen a ramp or elevator near the stairs, for instance, so people who cannot climb the stairs are able to reach the same destination. Similarly, someone blind could use assistive technology known as ascreen reader, which allows the user to hear information on a webpage — giving them access to the same content as someone who is able to see the page. The problem is that much of the online world is not built for assistive technology like screen readers. Even if a blind user has a screen reader activated, there may be content on a webpage that is totally inaccessible to them because of the way that the page is constructed. For example, if important images on a page lackalt text(which is read aloud by a screen reader when present , then the user is left without critical information about the content of the page and its purpose. Building content for screen readers is just one small part ofweb accessibility— “a11y” for short (there are 11 letters between the “a” and “y” — which has been discussed in engineering circles for years. After all, there are many different types of disabilities (per the CDC,about 26%of U.S. adults live with at least one form of disability , not to mention differences in language, location, internet connection and even the hardware or software used to access online content. We have inched forward as a society in our awareness of accessibility, yet Stanford has been perpetuating accessibility issues instead of teaching us about them. Many images across the University’s various websites are missing basic alt text. I once took a class where someone hard of hearing needed captions, but captions were not added to lectures until midway through the quarter. Accessibility should be the default, not tacked on only after specific needs are raised. It is not as if there aren’t resources out there for making content more accessible. Groups likeWebAIMand theW3C Web Accessibility Initiativehave been researching and sharing solutions for these issues for many years. Sites like edX hostfull-length courseson web accessibility. And there are growing communities onTwitterand other online forums that discuss the topic daily. In gaming, accessibility is being celebrated at venues like The Game Awards, where a new “Innovation in Accessibility Award” has beenhanded out over the past two years. On social media, there have been pushes to includealt textandclosed captioningwith the images and audio that we share. It should not be the job of people with disabilities to ask that Stanford take accessibility seriously. Just last week, a studentcalled out accessibility issueswith the recently opened Disability Community Space (DCS , reflecting a lack of proactivity by the University. If Stanford is waiting for a public complaint to act on any accessibility issue or to seek the necessary community feedback, then it is failing in its mission. Responding to concerns about the DCS won’t be enough. Stanford needs to dedicate more resources to accessibility education in the long term. That means educating itself and its community members. Web accessibility, for instance, deserves much more focus than a few elective classes that most students will never take. Everyone who passes through the University should be familiar with accessibility. As a recent graduate who has observed firsthand the consequences of not teaching accessibility (it is stunning how many professional engineers and designers know little to nothing about it , I would be happy to help Stanford incorporate web accessibility into its CS curriculum. I have learned a lot since entering industry, and I know there are others with expertise relevant to different fields. This all speaks to a larger issue: Stanford is sorely in need of a software engineering program, in addition to computer science, that teaches students about concepts they will encounter in industry. There are too many students like me who go through the Stanford CS coursework and are woefully uninformed, not just in accessibility, but in the uses of Git and other mainstays of modern software engineering. Accessibility, for its part, is very easy to approach. It is not a “hard problem” in computer science nor in any other field. But it requires giving a damn, and that requires education.

stanforddaily_2022_69,"“What’s your major?” This is the question that every Stanford student is asked as often as what their own name is. Over the past 10 years, the most likely answer has become Computer Science (CS , or one of its close relatives such as Symbolic Systems (SymSys or Mathematical and Computational Science (MCS . These three majors made up over a quarter of allundergraduate degrees conferred in 2019-2020and are still drawing students year on year. Despite the university’s apparent emphasis on aliberal arts education, students and faculty across all academic disciplines feel that Stanford is a tech school. This is unsurprising: Stanford alumni and faculty have built many of Silicon Valley’s giants, and this symbiotic relationship with the tech industry forms the basis for Stanford’s prestige. Many students come to Stanford precisely for its famed entrepreneurial culture, groundbreaking CS research, and direct route to Silicon Valley; these students very well may find their co-founders here, conduct research with a professor pioneering a field of artificial intelligence and walk out of Stanford with a slew of Big Tech job offers (Stanford is the2nd largestfeeder into Silicon Valley jobs, after UC Berkeley . But there are other, less desirable phenomena happening here: the metamorphoses of humanities and arts majors into computer science majors, and the industrial pipeline that shuttles CS majors directly into Big Tech. Sherry Xie ’25 came to Stanford intending to major in History. She has since switched to CS. “What really changed me was taking Math 51 and CS 106A first quarter,” Xie said. Unlike the intimidating philosophical discussions in SLE — the residential freshman humanities intensive that Xie also took — “the CS intro classes really make you feel like you can do them. And that’s the spell which means I keep going with it.” The messaging of introductory CS courses strongly encourages students to continue with CS regardless of their final grade. Lecturers frequently emphasize the real-world applications of every skill taught, as well as a clear path forward with the major. The 106 series in particular offers extensive student support through the section leading program and additional LaIR office hours, creating an inclusive and exciting learning environment. Professor Mehran Sahami, the Associate Chair for Education in the CS department, attributes the rate of major-switching in part to the fact that many students don’t have the opportunity to learn computer science before they get to college – these students may be wary of declaring their interest before coming to Stanford. The ability to quickly see results is also a motivator for pursuing CS, according to Nahum Maru ’25, also a CS major. “After just 106A or 106B, you’re able to create something significant, and you see how much people around you can do just five miles down the road,” he said. Some of Maru’s friends — also freshmen — are in seed-funding rounds for their blockchain startup, and others are making significant contributions at burgeoning companies. “So I think there’s definitely a culture where the most successful people at Stanford now seem to be CS majors,” he said. But as a result of this support and encouragement to pursue CS, Sahami said the Big Switch has created “capacity challenges for faculty” — nevertheless, he reiterated the department’s commitment to not institute a cap on the number of CS majors. The CS student to teaching faculty ratio which was nearly 20:1 as of 2019, almostfive timesthe University-wide student-faculty ratio – means that CS students have far less direct contact with faculty and tend to not have an intimate classroom experience. Instead of getting to know your peers or their ideas through discussion, you spend most of your time listening to lectures and completing p-sets, often on your own. What does this mean for other majors? “The most encouragement I received at the beginning was to do CS 106A and Math 51,” Xie said. “I don’t think I see that big of a push toward humanities intro classes.” She noted that overflowing waitlists for introductory humanities courses, in contrast to capless intro STEM classes, discouraged interested students from pursuing that discipline. Some underclassmen also recount being advised by upperclassmen to just “get through” PoliSci 1 in order to access higher-level classes. One prospective International Relations (IR major felt that the Introduction to International Relations (PoliSci 101 mostly involved learning specific jargon and theories from the textbook without much understanding of their context or real-world applications. This experience discouraged him from taking further IR classes, not wanting to “risk” the 5-unit commitment and miss out on taking classes that seem more applicable. To counteract the pull of the CS department, other departments could benefit from making their introductory classes more welcoming, accessible and exciting. Sahami pointed out that the CS department, particularly in the 106 series, expends great resources considering how to teach material in the most useful and engaging way possible. “Our courses are constantly under revision, and our pedagogy is always being re-examined,” he said. Introductory classes across all departments might be enhanced by increasing the network of TAs to support more students, or employing more faculty in that specific domain. If lecturers for introductory courses are especially charismatic and passionate about teaching, students might be more encouraged to take further classes. Finally, there should be a clearer sense of what classes suit what level of experience. For instance, there is no explicit introductory class for History or English. Another student majoring in IR said that she was frustrated that she hadn’t felt challenged by any of her classes yet, so she is taking CS 106A this quarter. If she had been told to take a specific higher-level course to begin with — as CS majors are told to skip to 106B or 107 and beyond depending on their experience — she may have found academic fulfillment outside of the CS department. These concerns over the growing imbalance in undergraduate majors should not be answered by any cap on the number of CS majors. Instead, we should focus on encouraging students of all backgrounds to be more interdisciplinary. “I don’t think anyone, including the Computer Science department, wants to see Stanford become the Stanford Institute of Technology,” Sahami told me. Andrew Benson is a CS Master’s student who teaches two classes (CS 107A and CS 9 while also being a full-time senior software engineer at Google. His view is that we should focus CS education towards non-CS majors. “It’s more beneficial for society for people of other disciplines to have the tools of CS, to help them do better in their disciplines,” he said. “Because CS is preparation for CS. But other disciplines will make society better.” In an effort to help CS majors expand their worldview beyond the tech bubble, Sahami co-foundedCS 182: Ethics, Public Policy, and Technological Changewith Rob Reich and Jeremy Weinstein, both of whom teach in the Political Science department. He explained that the university, although theoretically supportive of multidisciplinary work, still needs to recognise the greater effort faculty across departments must put in to effectively teach together. Many departments only offer faculty partial credit for co-taught classes. The CS 182 professors managed to negotiate more appropriate credit from the University. “If those kinds of things were more actively encouraged across the university, we might see more collaboration along those lines,” Sahami said. In 2018, Marc Tessier-Levigne announcedthree presidential initiatives. The first, recognising Stanford’s outsized responsibility in shaping the technology of tomorrow, is named Ethics, Society & Technology. In response, the CS department has in recent years placedgrowing emphasis on integrating an ethical education into its courses. However, student reception has not always matched the faculty’s well-intentioned efforts. Ethics lectures are emptier than programming content ones, and homework questions are often seen as too undirected, leading to the perception that ethics is simply an accessory to the core of the class. One CS major who did not want to be named said that “ethics is an important feature, I guess, but not what I enjoy.” The second presidential initiative is for Purposeful Engagement with Our Region, Nation & World. What do we consider purposeful engagement? In 2019, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times and several other major newspapers covered Stanford students’ #NoTechForICE protests, which criticized Palantir for providing technology to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.According to the NYT, a campus activist group called “Students for the Liberation of All People” hung a banner reading “Our software is so powerful it separates families” at Palantir’s offices. I asked 15 freshmen majoring in CS whether they were aware of this protest, or the activist group. None of them had heard of either. The sentiment of these protests certainly lingers on campus, but the movement seems to have lost momentum among newer students, especially considering how the pandemic fractured outgoing classes from incoming ones. And it’s all too easy to ignore that cognitive dissonance: in the competitive spirit that got many of us here in the first place, students compare salaries and name-recognition, prestige and exit options – in Sahami’s words, “trying to optimize their careers.” We’re already immersed in the landscape of lucrative tech jobs by geographic proximity alone. Then factor in information and recruiting sessions, career fairs, vast internship programs, conversations and endless LinkedIn stalking. All of which help make Big Tech “the default,” according to Nadin Tamer, a junior majoring in CS and minoring in Education, who is co-president of Code the Change and interned at Facebook last summer.“You wouldn’t know about these non-profit jobs unless you actually went looking for them,” she said. “Whereas you do get a lot of exposure to Big Tech stuff, just by being here and listening to people’s conversations.” So what about ethics? In 2022, you’d have to be woefully under-informed to believe that Big Tech companies are forces for pure good in the world. But there remains a contentious debate over whether it is better to effect change from within or outside of those companies. Some members of the Stanford community believe it’s possible to generate ethical change from within a company, and some say that individuals are essentially neutral, as their work cannot significantly contribute to nor change the operations of a massive corporation like Meta. Benson argued that change is possible when many potential employees coordinate. “Collectively, you can say ‘okay, let’s try to encourage software engineers on the whole to not work for certain companies’ if we think that will help them change their practices. Or we can encouragestudents to form new companiesthat will be more talented and through competition try to change their policies, ” he said. On the other hand, an individual would likely have to “rise the ranks in leadership to be privy to decisions being made at a high level and influence them.” Many entering Big Tech say that they only plan to work there for a few years, then leave to found a startup, do non-profit work, or pursue their real passion. Some do. Some also grow accustomed to the lifestyle associated with that job and forget what they originally had planned for themselves – much as many students entering Stanford forget the passions and ambitions they had as fresh-faced first-years. It is, no doubt, an immense privilege to be able to reject a six-figure job. “Working in industry, especially the software industry, provides you with the opportunity to live very comfortably because the pay is so good, and there are many benefits in terms of quality of life,” Benson said. But it would be dishonest to characterize our career options as simply Big Tech or non-profit public service work, with nothing that is more value-aligned in between. Maru described how, as a CS student from a low-income background, he was initially “enamored” by the starting salaries at the Big Five companies, Alphabet (Google , Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook , and Microsoft. “I was trying to optimize prestige to eventually get more money to help my family,” he said. However, his viewpoint began to change after seeing how passionate some friends were in pursuing their own projects beyond classes. “If I’m going to go into industry, I’d very much want to work on problems I think are intellectually interesting,” he said. “I also have to think, are they going to use what I’m doing ethically?” One student may be the main breadwinner for their family; another may need to pay off bills and loans; some may simply, and reasonably, want the financial security and quality of life. Working for Big Tech, as one interviewee put it, is like a “rubber stamp on your resume”; much like the stamp of attending Stanford University, it automatically deems you smart, successful and worthy of further opportunities. The extra credibility conferred by working at Big Tech is no small thing. But are we purely seeking to leverage our education to build clout for our professional lives? We don’t owe it to Stanford to do everything we said we would do on campus. But don’t we owe it to our past selves to not abandon those causes we so strongly advocated for, those passions that we spent so much of our lives cultivating? We’re constantly told by University administration that we are here for a reason. We were given this education for a reason: to create daring and moving art; to bring communities together; to contribute fresh ideas to a shrinking field of study. It is our choice whether to deliver on that reason. For recipients of a name-brand “elite” education, getting a job in finance, consulting, or Big Tech is a comfortable route. The actual process of completing the major, writing applications, and undergoing endless rounds of interviews may be painstaking, but you never have to make active decisions: you simply follow the four-year-plan, the corporate flowchart. Being at Stanford makes it extremely easy for us to default to the safety of the pipeline, but being at Stanford also means we are in the rare position tonotdo that and still live comfortably. Nobody I talked to for this article or in casual conversation around Stanford cited excitement — let alone doing good in the world —as a reason to work for Big Tech. How can Stanford balance their commitment to enable students to have agency in their careers with their responsibility to shape the “leaders of tomorrow”? If Stanford wishes to truly protect a culture of creative and academic freedom, the University must make a greater effort to separate its undergraduate education from the influences of Silicon Valley. Our intellectual freedom to stroll or sprint down different academic avenues should be equal – if so many students who were previously unexposed to CS discover a passion for it, shouldn’t other students who gain similar access to film studies or femgen at Stanford be encouraged to fall in love with that discipline and pursue it through Stanford and beyond? We must also make an individual effort to change the cultural narrative around these fields of study. One student I talked to in the course of this article told me he was considering several majors: “double E, math, physics, they’re all awesome. But you know, for you they’re probably the same majors.” I’m a prospective MCS major, but in my capacity as a reporter, he assumed that I wouldn’t even understand distinctions between STEM disciplines. There is a common perception among some techies that humanities, social sciences and arts majors are easier and less intellectually rigorous. Stanford has several possible strategies they could pursue if they want to facilitate a more open-minded and interdisciplinary academic culture, particularly within the world of CS. Classes such as CS 182W, which is dedicated to exploring the ethical and political implications of CS innovations, could be bumped up in the order of required classes — say around when students are taking CS 107, the majority of whom plan to study a CS-related major or minor. This would help students engage deeply and early on with the ways that technologies they create may affect the world, and have that in mind as they continue developing their technical skills. Currently, such classes, including exploratory WAYS requirements, are notoriously backloaded to senior year where students scramble to fulfill them all in order to graduate. A more consistent integration of this liberal arts education would expose students to new fields of study while they still have ample time to explore them further. Stanford could even join the ranks of some of its peer institutions in actively encouraging its students to reject the pipeline – and I mean at the highest level of messaging, as when Harvard’s President Faust urged graduating students to eschew the “all but irresistible recruiting juggernaut” in 2008. This may be biting the hand that feeds you, but perhaps we could all benefit from a bolder institutional stance. What I’m advocating for is intentionality and self-awareness. We are students at Stanford. I’m guessing that most of us chose to come here partly due to the weight that name carries: the prestige, power, and wealth of opportunity associated with our education. Despite pressures from parents and peers, we shouldn’t simply chase – or worse, fall into – the next most “prestigious” thing, believing that everyone around us is doing the same. We have more agency than we think, and our choices become our friends’ choices, our community’s choices. Campus culture is ultimately composed of the sum of our individual decisions. And we can take a step back to realize that being here has already given us an enormous amount of security. As people with this privilege, we should never sleepwalk through our careers; if you choose to “sell out”— as many students refer to working for Big Tech, finance, or consulting — it should be with the same intentionality and consideration as those who choose a non-traditional route. Life is long, and 2 to 3 years at a Big Tech company certainly wouldn’t define our entire careers — but the choice itself is a signal to others that our personal prestige is more important than our values. This is not about rejecting CS or Big Tech. It’s about approaching our precious last years of formal education with academic curiosity and intentionality, and remembering that our lives are our own. We own our academic and industrial labor. We own our beliefs and dreams, and have the power to influence the beliefs and dreams of those around us. Let’s act accordingly.

crimson_2022_42,"As a Harvard student, I recognize that I’m only here because the College has grown more diverse. The institution that primarily served wealthy, white, male Boston Brahmins in the 19th century has today opened its doors to people of all classes, races, genders, sexualities, nationalities, religions, and more. Seeing the diversity amongst my classmates gives me pride while walking through campus. All college campuses and workplaces should strive for diversity: Diverse perspectives, stemming from diverse experiences,enrich our conversations and work. However, as it currently stands, affirmative action centered around race seems too blunt a mechanism to completely and respectfully consider the unique backgrounds and resources of individual applicants. For example, an analysis found that Asian Americans consistently receivelower personality ratingsthan all other racial groups. This dispreference disregards the heterogeneity present in the Asian American community, which encapsulates vast multicultural and multiethnic backgrounds stretching across the world’s largest continent, as well as the greatest income inequality amongst racial groups in the United States. This overlooking of economic background for the more general consideration of race is not unique to Asian American applicants. Thetipsgiven by our race-conscious affirmative action system seem to primarily benefit well-off minorities, with 71 percent of Black and Hispanic students at Harvard coming from college-educated homes with incomesabove the national median. I don’t contest the existence of structural racism in the United States. However,social science researchsuggests that it is economic segregation, not racial, that explains the achievement gap between schools. It is in fact a result of structural racism that race and class are so tightly confounded. Socioeconomic diversity should be prioritized in college admissions because it can directly ground evaluations of merit, in considering an applicant’s achievements given the resources available to them. ABlack studentwho grew up in the South Side of Chicago with an underfunded public education system will have a drastically different experience and capacity for achievement than aBlack studentwho went to one of the top private schools in Hawaii. Due to therelationshipbetween race and economic status, this new income-based, race-neutral affirmative action system would still achieve significant racial diversity — while also eliminating extreme cases of unfair evaluation, such as a low-income Asian American or white applicant being penalized for not achieving as much as a wealthy underrepresented minority applicant. Ultimately, such a conceptualization of merit would allow Harvard to identify students who have outperformed despite limiting resources, an incredibly difficult and impressive endeavor, and to provide these students with significant resources to unlock their full potential. Given this conception of merit, it is indefensible for legacy applicants to receive preferential treatment. These applicants, as the children of statistically high-earning Harvard graduates, already have massive advantages in the college admissions process, even before their legacy status is factored in. It is an open secret that Harvard gives preferential treatment towards applicants from families that have donated or will donate to Harvard, which Harvard may think is more likely for alumni. Legacies make up nearly half of the infamous backdoor acceptance Z-list. Their parents may have the funds tobribe officials at elite collegesto admit their children, such as in the Varsity Blues scandal. Clearly, these legacy applicants do not stand on an equal playing field with their peers, because of class advantages passed down from their parents. Continuing to admit legacy applicants is one way in which Harvard’s admissions process hasfailedto cultivate socioeconomic diversity on campus. Low-income students regularly reportfeelings of alienationfrom their wealthier counterparts, as friendships often cleave along class lines. These lacking cross-class friendships could greatlyboost socioeconomic mobilityfor low-income students. It doesn’t have to be this way. Our neighboring institution MIT does not consider legacy status in its admissions, and — unsurprisingly — exhibitsmore socioeconomic diversityand increased socioeconomic mobility compared to Harvard. Furthermore, MIT alumni donate more money and more frequently, on average, compared to Harvard alumni. It is entirely possible for Harvard to stop legacy admissions, with no negative repercussions to donations. Removing legacy admissions would be the first step for Harvard in the necessary pursuit of socioeconomic diversity and merit as defined in the context of applicants’ resources. Finally, Harvard’s affirmative action system could align with American public opinion on the system, as well as social science research findings on the comparatively higher obstacles resulting from class than from race. Racial divisions invoked by arguments from Students for Fair Admissions can start to heal, as all economically disadvantaged peoples see that they are given due opportunity. As Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote, “It is a simple matter of justice that America, in dealing creatively with the task of raising the Negro from backwardness, should also be rescuing a large stratum of the forgotten white poor.” I strive to live in an America where one may be born economically disadvantaged but ascend the socioeconomic ladder due to equal opportunity. After all, that’s what the American dream is all about. Harvard can engineer this dream, for the thousands of applicants it admits per year, by prioritizing socioeconomic diversity — and it all starts with ending legacy admissions.

rice_thresher_2022_46,"ByRiley Barker3/8/22 11:35pm ​​Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. I believe that at the heart of a thoughtful opinion piece lies an acknowledgment of its author’s blindness and that no opinion piece, especially those penned by cis white men, will ever wholistically convey a sociological issue’s full scope and importance. In that spirit, I would like to begin this writing with an admission: though I would like to spark discussion about compulsory voting within the hedges, I will not be able to address all of the nuances of a question as complicated as “How should we, as a community, vote?” in 1000 words. It’s no secret: Rice has a voting problem. According to theThresher Editorial Board, only 24 percent of campus voted in the 2021 Student Association Elections, a number barely nudged by the 2022 election’s 26.81 percent. For comparison, the 2014 midterms had the lowest turnout for any national election in recent U.S. history. The rate?36.4 percent. All Rice undergraduates can vote in SA elections. Unlike millions of individuals who face down the scourge of voter suppression or cannot legally exercise suffrage, Rice students do not have to overcome any barriers to vote; we just have to open our emails. Of course, the stakes of Rice’s election fall far beneath national elections. However, the question still stands: why do three-quarters of us disengage from the simplest, most accessible democratic system we can shape? I think the answer lies in the crossroads of the two cardinal sins of electoral politics as they manifest in the microcosm of campus life: interpersonal conflict and apathy. I have another admission to make. I almost succumbed to my own feelings of apathy and seriously debated abstaining from the 2022 SA election before casting my ballot. Why? Over the past year and a half I have attended Rice, I have become disillusioned with its campus politics as they have come into clearer view. As a disclaimer, as a music major pursuing dual degrees alongside a job, I have not engaged heavily with on-campus initiatives yet, buried instead in work and practice. That said, by observation from afar, campus politics seem to me an opaque conglomerate of virtue signaling, flashy language, empty gestures by our administration (see: theWilly “compromise” and performative activism. This type of political environment repels some students by stoking fear of engagement in campus politics due to social repercussions and allows others to be apathetic because, in the mind of the casual observer — amidst all the sparring — does anything everreallychange? This is not to discount the vital work of hundreds of student leaders who actively, through their position in SA or independently beyond it, spearhead campus initiatives and drive the largely progressive political soul of the university. I believe that their work is valuable and virtuous, and I am grateful to have peers who use their time to benefit our collective lives. However, despite the commitment of those passionate individuals, communicative representation remains a problem at Rice. The SA hasstruggledto maintain respect and legitimacy as a source of student power for years. In brainstorming a solution, I think our best option is radical: compulsory voting. Imagine Rice University implemented compulsory voting in student elections. I strongly believe that such a system, one that applies positive incentives for voting and negative incentives for delaying or not voting, would not only increase campus turnout to near 100 percent but would make Rice’s student body a far moredemocratic, civically engaged and healthy political environment. Specifically, how might such a system work? My country of origin,Australia, and other nations with mandatory voting tend to use financial incentives like fines, but a system that withholds Tetra from undergraduate Rice students is one that would surely be universally rejected. However, Rice is uniquely positioned as an enforcement structure in that it already makes students accomplish digital tasks: clearing ESTHER holds. Rice students are forced to fill out course evaluations in order to receive their grades and unlock various other functions like signing up for classes. With a few lines of code and a link to the SA election survey, the Office of Information Technology could mandate voting as a prerequisite to using ESTHER. SA elections currently take place in late February, which means in order for such an incentive to be timely the voting window must move, else Rice finds a different way of enforcing the vote. I am curious — if there is interest in this idea: are there other enforcement options for Rice? Also, in anticipation of criticism, I acknowledge that compulsory models, despite their benefits, still face an uphill battle against voter apathy and an uninformed electorate as well as upset those who see voting as just another freedom one can choose to engage with. That said, I strongly believe that the Rice community, being composed of thoughtful, civically conscious individuals, is exactly the sort of community that ought to be forced to engage in civic behavior. By ingraining the responsibility one has to vote in local elections into our students, Rice might just ingrain that civic behavior into its students for their lifetimes, a feat with effects that extend far beyond the sphere of SA. I do not believe the Thresher Editorial Board writing “Vote. It’s not that hard.” or GroupMe campaigns of SA candidates will change the minds of 75 percent of students. Rice is the sum of its many remarkable parts, but, at current, there are no real incentives to participate in a system that the majority of students distrust. We should ask ourselves as a community: do we want to be led by individuals whom fewer than 15 percent of us have entrusted to lead? We can pass as many resolutions as we want, sponsor as many projects as desired, launch as many initiatives as is possible, and form as many task forces as we care to name, but eventually, we must be bold: ensuring proper representation at Rice means enforcing the vote. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

state_press_2022_49,"Given the urgency with which we must act to avoid catastrophes, we need elected leaders who look to the future and who are willing to act now. The Southwest is ground zero for some of the most pressing issues threatening our way of life. We know from personal experience, as well asdataover time, that Arizona and its neighboring states are getting drier and hotter. We are witnessing significantcutsin the Colorado River water supply, as well as heat waves, droughts and wildfires with increasing strength and frequency. As is the case around the world, those who are the most vulnerable are impacted the most. In Arizona, people who can t afford air conditioning or proper housing are dying in growing numbers from heat-related causes. We cannot prepare for the future without addressing these long-term threats. It would be my hope that incoming elected officials will make global change one of the centerpieces of their legislative action. Earth s systems, like politics, are not static. We live in a dynamic system that is changing rapidly. The speed and scale of change means that we require different political action from what was needed in the past. We have pushed the life-supporting systems of our planet past their limits, and those effects are directly putting the people in the Southwest at risk. We must all work together — politicians, civil servants, researchers and citizens — to identify and enact the best policies that can adapt to multiple, interdependent stressors. Given the urgency with which we must act to avoid moving from crises to catastrophes, we need elected leaders who look to the future and are willing to act now.

crimson_2022_39,"Everyone, especially at Harvard, is anticipating the results of this week’s Supreme Court case regarding affirmative action in Harvard’s admissions. In the months to come, everything could potentially change about the demographic of students in higher education. Students for Fair Admissions, the plantiff, is suing Harvard for alleged discrimination towards Asian American Students. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is currently partnering with many student organizations to influence the Court’s vote and strategize how to move forward after the outcome. And, this past weekend, Harvard students traveled to Washington D.C. to defend our current admissions system. Needless to say, this decision will affect millions across the country. We should not take this Supreme Court decision lightly. If affirmative action is struck from college admissions, the composition of Black college students isprojected to be cut by over 50 percent.A world without race-based, class-based, and location-based admissions is a regressive society. Diversity in college admissions needs to be prioritized. Yet saving affirmative action is only part of the solution. Though it is obviously important for college admissions, I see it as only a band-aid to a much larger issue in American education. Colleges are not the only academic spaces that lack diversity. The reason why we need affirmative action in college admissions is the same reason we need equity movements in high schools, middle schools, elementary schools, and pre-schools. Some students are not granted the opportunity to seek higher education because they are deprived of adequate educational resources at a younger age. If marginalized students received access to adequate resources before entering college, then affirmative action would be less significant in college admissions. Black students are twice as likely to go to high-poverty schools. Going from a school with minimal resources to a school with time-consuming course loads, extracurriculars, and more isunreasonable.Students who benefit from affirmative action, and are allowed to enter into these elite spaces, are granted access too late. There are students here that have to work twice as hard as students who went to elite and private middle schools and high schools because they had half the experience. They do this in sacrifice of their mental and physical health. Although colleges should continue to have race-conscious admissions and give under-resourced students a chance, they should not be forced to experience these opportunities under such daunting conditions. Why should our schooling system start making sense at the college level? Private schools, which have the ability to apply affirmative action in their admissions, should be the first to tackle this issue — but often fail to do so. Phillips Academy in Andover, arguably the best private high school in America, has a student population that isless than 7 percent Black. Although our current affirmative action system is not applicable to public schools, it is important to not forget those students either. Over 20 percent of Boston public school studentsdo not graduateat all, but once you take a 30-minute drive to Wellesley,nearly every student in the town graduates.Almost 90 percent of students in Boston public schools are students of color, and inWellesley nearly 70 percent of the student population is white. There are drastic differences between schools that are only 30 minutes away from each other. We need to fight for diversity and inclusion amongst all students, especially those who don’t have access to privatized and elite schools. Schools can determine the fate and livelihood of the students who have little other choice but to enroll in them. Our education system will remain broken if we don’t start paying proper attention and care to preschool students all the way up to students in higher education. Yes, we should be in support of keeping affirmative action here at Harvard and at other colleges and universities. But this is simply not enough. Affirmative action is a shallow solution to a much deeper issue in the American education system. We are failing a larger demographic of students who deserve the same educational opportunities as everyone else. Angie Gabeau ’25, a Crimson Editorial Editor, lives in Winthrop House."
stanforddaily_2022_12,"Freedom of speech is a hallmark of great universities where honest dialogue and the airing of facts is prized. And so it is disturbing, particularly inan era of Big Lies, that Stanford has taken to suppressing the truth by stifling peaceful protest and discouraging student dissent. In September, at the opening reception for the Doerr School of Sustainability (which is ironically funded by Big Oil , a cordoned-off “free speech zone” was set up far away from the festivities such that party music drowned out thechantsof about 100 protesters, including myself. At a recentAlumni weekend event promoting the Doerr School, security staff ordered me and fellow protesters to stay in a similarly designated zone, thereby preventing us from mingling with alums to pass out leaflets. And two weeks ago, at theGlobal Energy Forum which hosted ExxonMobil’s CEOat the Hoover Institution, there was such a wide security perimeter — metal barricades patrolled by Sheriff’s deputies — that few forum attendees seemed to even be aware of us loud protesters waving big signs. Such measures are often undertaken in the name of security. But then why are they being used on campus just recently (previous coverage of campus protests do not mention the practice ? Perhaps “free speech zones” are a tacit admission that protesters are a force to be reckoned with, a sign of their growing influence. Still, if security is the only concern, then why not invite student representatives to present dissenting views at these events? Meanwhile, Stanford showcased their double standard while hosting therecent Academic Freedom Conference. The institution held an invitation-only conference hosting many conservative panelists in person while relegating the general public and the media to a livestream version of proceedings, an option that was only added after an uproar. Students and community members are entitled to have a voice in university affairs and campus activities. They have a right to show up and express dissatisfaction and be heard without fear of reprisal. But that sort of support was noticeably absent four weeks ago when the Bechtel International Centerwarned foreign studentsby mass email to be “peaceful and respectful” while protesting, lest it affect their immigration status. And that sort of support is not conveyed by keeping student protesters corralled away from industry-friendly PR events on campus. Stanford officials are perhaps patting themselves on the back for having struck an expedient compromise for handling protest. But having witnessed first-hand how they have chosen to stuff free speech into a tiny box and shove it off to one side, unseen and unheard, I’m ashamed of my alma mater. By zoning out dissent, Stanford’s approach smacks of a police state, not healthy debate.Ralph King, B.A. ’80, a former reporter for the Wall Street Journal, made aPBS documentary featureabout a Stanford D.school course that aired in 2013."
ubyssey_2022_21,"June 15, 2022 Written byAquila Underwood This article contains mentions of violence against Indigenous people and missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and Two Spirit people. Safety feels like playingLeague of Legendswith friends at 3 a.m., sitting in IKB until midnight and watching your friends leave on one of those silly electric scooters with a skateboard behind it. Safety does not feel like being scared of going out while wearing beaded earrings at night, crying on Valentine’s Day or paying an extra $20 to get medication instead of showing your status card. Contrary to my friends’ beliefs, being a ‘racially ambiguous,’ ‘educated,’ confident person who dresses like a (stylish grandpa has not and will not save me from the fate of my Indigenous sisters — simply put by Mary Teegee in Jessica McDiarmid’sHighway of Tears, “because I am an Indigenous woman, I am six times more likely to be murdered than my non-Indigenous sister.” My life is connected to those of every Indigenous woman, girl and Two Spirit person because of the violence we face daily. You may know what Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two Spirit (MMIWG2S is, but you probably don’t understand its reality. My life began near the Highway of Tears. But, I didn’t think much about the highway as a kid or teen. I moved to New Zealand, where highways were consistently interrupted by towns and mountains and seas and our parents’ generation grew up hitchhiking. It was only when I was about to return to Canada that I was brought back to my birthplace. Back to the highway. To prepare me, my sister gave me a list of things to avoid — what to do and not to do as an Indigenous woman. She warned me that I looked more Tsawout than Μāορι and that my racial ambiguity wouldn’t pass as easily in Canada as it did in New Zealand. She taught me about the Highway of Tears, told me to stay away from similar highways, to be cautious of men, to not go out alone and to always tell someone where you are and where you are going. Situations that would be safe for non-Indigenous women were not situations that would be safe for me. The people meant to protect me were not to be trusted; colonial roots, ulterior motives and the knowledge that taking me instead of my friend would result in less punishment. Armed with this knowledge of one of Canada’s biggest issues, I returned. Immediately, I realized that allies didn’t really care. It wasn’t always a lack of motivation — it was also a lack of understanding and education. The fear implemented in us from birth was not implemented in non-Indigenous people as well. My friends have fun meeting people of their own ethnicities, so they didn’t understand why I don’t like strangers knowing I’m Indigenous. They didn’t understand how my safety as an Indigenous woman is different from the safety of a non-Indigenous woman. They especially didn’t understand why I was crying on the phone to my sister on the other side of the world because I had a bad day where I was reminded of the grandmother I never met and the girls who never returned to their homes; of their vulnerability and my own. Ironically, on this day while my friends celebrated love, I mourned my missing and murdered sisters and siblings. February 14 marked the31st annual Women’s Memorial Marchin Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, a memorial march organized to remember the lives of the Indigenous women, girls and Two Spirit people. On this day, I realized the chasm between me and my non-Indigenous friends. How was I supposed to tell them how scared I was? How much sorrow I felt every day, but especially this day? I did not know how to do it. My stubbornness and pride refused to show weakness or portray my people as weak. We are vulnerable, but we are strong — we are as strong as we can be. The issue is not with us but with those who hurt us. I guess this is me telling them then and me telling you now. Our tears are real, and we feel so much pain. Our pain is built into the society you live in. If there’s one thing you owe us, it is to educate yourself. Even if you’ll never be able to live our pain, try to understand it. We will smile and cry and persevere, fight for our futures and look after our own, but nothing will change unless you change. Help us to end this war we find ourselves fighting.

stanforddaily_2022_45,"On May 25, Dean Arun Majumdar of the newDoerr School of Sustainabilitylauncheda process for creating a set of shared values and goals for the school by the end of this fall. The decisions we make today about hiring and research funding in the Doerr School will shape the knowledge, skills and values that Stanford graduates bring to sustainability problem-solving for decades to come. As we havemadeclear, we welcome the opportunity to join this conversation to critically evaluate the mission-alignment of the programs that will be part of the new school. Incoming Dean Arun Majumdar has mademultiple promisesof a listening tour to engage with students, faculty and staff about the principles the Doerr School will uphold. Thus far, Dean Majumdar’s office has scheduled private meetings with faculty, students and postdocs in each department separately but has not scheduled public forums. We contend that, without including public forums, this approach artificially silos conversations. To ensure that the process for establishing shared values and criteria is as transparent, inclusive, and effective as possible, we demand the following: Dean Majumdar has not responded to our request for details on the administration’s plans for the listening tour, nor have we heard whether or not Town Halls will be scheduled. In the meantime: We therefore call on the Dean to initiate a transparent process for consulting with environmental justice experts and supporters on the school’s hiring, funding, partnerships, and other critical decisions.The process should reflect the findings of theEnvironmental Justice Working Groupand its intergenerational leadership team of students, faculty and staff.Illustrating the broad and longstanding support for hiring EJ scholars at Stanford, the EJWG received over800 signatures in support of its 2018 EJ cluster hire proposal– a priority that should be reflected in new school hiring decisions. A siloed and closed-door decision-making process is vulnerable tospecial interest groupsand short-sighted decisions that will forego deeper inquiry and deliberation on how we might build a new school that benefits the broader global community and generations to come. Given the long-term impact of these decisions, we urge Dean Majumdar and the Doerr School leadership to shape the school in a truly transparent and democratic manner. This is an opportunity for the Doerr School to demonstrate true leadership in this time of climate crisis. We look forward to joining the conversation in coming weeks.

crimson_2022_81,"My first week on campus involved a lot of laughter and looks of confusion. In the hustle of introducing myself to the largest freshman class size that Harvard College has ever had, I would run through quick facts about myself and then wait for the responses of my peers. The responses of mirth and barely hidden chuckles, gasps and words of pity were quick to come on everyone’s faces. No one ever seemed happy or interested to know I was from Oklahoma. I understand that it might be easy to look down upon my seemingly average pan-handled home state from the supposedly extravagant East and West Coasts. But when I introduce myself as a student from Oklahoma, I am not looking for reactions of shock or giggles or second-hand embarrassment. Rather, I am looking for an understanding that our respective hometowns played a crucial role in making us the people that we are today. Reactions that look down upon the place where I was born and raised seem to only cement the notion that my home is less than others, thereby making me less than others. To outsiders, I am simply the girl from Oklahoma, nothing more. I know that Oklahoma deserves some of the negative reactions it gets. And frankly, I disapprove of some aspects of Oklahoma as well, like itstroublesomehistory— such as the Tulsa Race Massacre, where a white mob burned over a thousand buildings and killed hundreds of Black people — andabusive, uninformeddecisions. Even the creation of Oklahoma was undesirable: It began as a territory for the use of the colonizing American government to forcefully relocate thousands of Native Americans on theTrail of Tears. Moving forward through time, Oklahoma hasn’t done much to change that negative reputation. The Bible Belt state leads with some of theworst public schools, the mostdamaged public health, and thehighest incarcerationrate in the U.S. Moreover, two years into the pandemic, much of Oklahoma still opposes measures that prevent the spread of the deadlyCovid-19 pandemic. But this place, with all of its pitfalls, is my home. This is the place where I had my first kiss, my first crush, my first love. This is the place with the most beautiful clouds and fruitful land I’ve ever seen. This is one of the few places where stars still shine undimmed by pollution and where the moon seems to light up the whole night sky. This is a place full of back porch conversations and rampant tornadoes with children huddled around the windows to “catch themselves a ‘nader.” Not being fully south or midwest, Oklahoma still encompasses the classic Southern hospitality and Midwestern “get ‘er done” attitude. This place is my home. I don’t claim or identify with its behavior and continued problems — but I do claim the memories and relationships that I have built here. I claim the rolling plains and the turbulent winds. I claim the open space and the clean air. I claim the smiles through the car windows and the waves as you pass someone on the street. I claim the Oklahoma that helped raise me and nurture me to become who I am today. So when people laugh at or pity a small-town girl from rural Oklahoma, they do so with the limited knowledge that an outsider would have. But when I say I am from Oklahoma, I am not laughing or looking for pity. For my classmates to automatically see my home state as a negative reflection of who I am further alienates me from them. To frown upon others roots rather than being understanding of where they come from is emblematic of the rising division in our nation, perpetuating an environment that is already dense with the disease of “us versus them.” In a world where we are all just striving to belong, why should one person’s birthplace be inferior to another’s? I am simply saying that I come from my home, the same as you. I am a girl from Oklahoma, nothing more and nothing less. Home is not a physical location. Home is where you find your safe space. Home is where comfort can thrive peacefully in the uncomfortable. Let’s rejoice in the diversity of people’s homes, let’s understand that they are complex and can be the worst and yet most important place in someone’s life. Take pride in the place you grew up in, even with all the roses and thorns. Don’t judge your home with the opinions of others, rather see it through the memories of your life. I celebrate my home and know that one day I will bring it change. The parts of it that I don’t claim, the tangled lines of the state’s history, will one day be transformed. One day, we will all find the beauty of each other’s homes and empathize with the roots of each other’s stories. I love my home with all my hate, and you should too. It’s Oklahoma, a love-hate story after all. Hea Pushpraj ‘25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Straus Hall."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_36,"What’s all this hullabaloo over chocolate candy morsels? No more than a miraculously executed marketing ruse — that’s what. In a chain of predictable events, Mars, Incorporated rolled out amakeoverfor its cast of anthropomorphic M&Ms candy characters. They pat themselves on their backs for their progressiveness. EvenFox News host Tucker Carlson went on a tongue-in-cheek rantbecause he no longer wants to have a drink with the “less sexy” Green M&M. Cue the fake outrage and subsequent discourse on Twitter over the human traits assigned to some mascot whose only purpose is selling sugar to the masses. Nobody asked for this, and yet it’s all we’re talking about. That is, until the well of irony runs dry and we simply have no more bandwidth to weigh in on matters of Brown M&M’s frumpy new kitten heels or Orange M&M embracing his generalized anxiety. By this time, the outrage economy will have churned out some other nonsense to dilute consumer intelligence and clog Twitter feeds for the next 48 hours. The news media never disappoints in this regard because, as consumers, we’ve made it so easy. Pearl-clutching might as well be the new national pastime. One has to give it to Mars for concocting this perfect ploy, which has successfully diverted any unwanted attention from their unethical business practices. Surely the recent class-action lawsuit alleging that Mars’aiding and abetting of child slave labordoesn’t warrant more scrutiny than the pressing matters of computer-generated footwear. Asconservative pundits lamentthe loss of M&M’s libidinal appeal and liberalsmiss the joke entirely, corporations get to dodge accountability on the real issues. All the while, we’re reduced to thememe of two Soyjacksscreaming and pointing at each other. Is anyone else feeling secondhand embarrassment? Something’s got to give before everything in front of us becomes one big smokescreen. We play right into the hands of corporations when we signal both our support and contempt for their “more nuanced” M&M character’s personas and their supposed commitment to “increase a sense of belonging for ten million people by 2025,” whatever that’s supposed to mean. Their vague missions and even more shallow means by which they plan to achieve them are mere distractions. Indeed, this is a rather silly and absurd example. We’re talking about chocolate candy after all. And yet, it epitomizes exactly where we are culturally. Which is to say that meaningful culture is scarce, and these are the scraps we’re left to grapple with. Rather than engage with the latest in visual arts, music, literature or anything that provides valuable discourse, we instead feel inclined to mull and argue over branding and marketing optics. Everything has become commodified, and we’re the agents. It doesn’t take much to see there is more to this than theusual rhetoricà la “this is the future liberals want.” The stakes are much higher. This is the future corporate stakeholders want. “Woke capitalism” will continue to run rampant while nothing changes and society becomes further alienated. Eventually we will move on as a collective into some new partisan debate, only to be further divided. Subject matter as trivial as this can only keep the public’s interest for so long, and by the time you read this, Green M&M’s go-go boots will feel like a distant memory. Rest assured, as Super Bowl LVI looms just around the corner, Mars, Incorporated has likely spared no expense for the commercial debut of their new, more inclusive chocolate candies.

wildcat_arizona_2022_50,"Digital illustration of alien listening to music in headphones. During the past few summer months of unbearable sweating and Tucson monotony, I got stuck shuffling the same music I have been for years now. I was never — and still am not — quite sure why I became so apprehensive towards any new artists. I used to keep up with my Spotify-curated Discover Weekly playlist, and I used to spend my nights exploring indie music while surfing Pinterest trying to manifest my vision of a dream aesthetic. Although simple, those times brought so much productivity. When I had new music to listen to, I looked forward to waking up, walking out the door and strolling to class with some fresh tunes to make me feel cool in front of all the strangers I walked past. I even felt cool in the library while I was struggling so hard to understand cellular respiration and organelle functions. No matter how boring or arduous life became, I at least had music to come back to. Since I spent the whole summer on a constant Tame Impala, Wallows and Phoenix loop, I figured the beginning of the school year would be the right time to start exploring once again as I melt on my way to class. New year, new me. Even better, I decided to abridge my search to strictly University of Arizona student artists and found quite a range of genres (although I will be making no attempt to define or identify them here . Whether you find yourself in the same boat as me or not, I invite you to give these four artists a listen. After all, they may be in your psych discussion group or you might walk past them at the same time every Thursday afternoon on your way to the Student Union Memorial Center. Plus, listening to them now will grant you bragging rights in the future because you discovered them before they became a huge deal. Vic Mystic You can listen to Vic Mystic onSpotifyandApple Musicand give him a follow onInstagram. Solo artist Vic Mystic offers his rhythm and cool tone in a very unique way. I often find small artists can blend together, though his sound is distinctive and his songs have a way of lingering in my mind. I find his subdued voice to be the perfect accompaniment to his electronic skills and sweet guitar riffs. At the same time, as I scrolled through his discography, his growth is apparent. From 2019’s “Sonic Summer” to “Broken Screen” released this year, he shows impressive improvement with his guitar riffs, creativity behind production and voice tonality. It’s difficult to compare Vic Mystic to any popular artist, but if you enjoy Djo, Foster the People or Still Woozy, Vic Mystic’s inventive music is sure to catch your attention. RELATED:OPINION: You should fall in love with reading ettkhett You can listen to ettkhett onSpotifyandApple Musicand give her a follow onInstagram. On Sept. 1, an artist by the name of ettkhett released her second strictly instrumental album. She is a self-described industrial trip-hop producer which sounds like the perfect description to me — someone who knows nothing about subgenres of music and subgenres of those subgenres. What I admire about her music is that she is evidently imaginative and, through her music, carries a certain dark brilliance about her. With titles like “the promised land,” “I Don’t Need to Be Human” and “child eater,” ettkhett’s music radiates an obscure vibe. At times, she uses the common piano or drums melody but always manages to include something bizarre like zombie-esque screams, drilling noises or crackling static that elevates her creativity to a level like none other. moon nite You can listen to moon nite onSpotifyandApple Musicand give him a follow onInstagram. If you want to wallow in your sorrows but feel comforted that you are not alone, I suggest checking out moon nite. He presents a lovely softness in his voice and melodies alike as he sings about longing, loneliness and love: the three deadly ls. “Shedding My Skin in the Front Yard” may give you the mental image of a heavy metal concert nightmare, though you would be surprised by its calm repetition. I want to say moon nite draws inspiration from Radiohead and lightly resembles Eyedress with his laidback voice and almost somber guitar. Overall, there is great quality behind his production and each instrumental accompaniment and guitar riff seems to be carefully and effectively chosen to enhance his lyrics. Dante Olita You can listen to Dante Olita onYouTubeand give him a follow onInstagram. Let us not forget that good music can be classical too. A very skilled artist from UA is classical guitar student Olita. To put it simply, watching Olita play is inspiring. He almost always plays with his eyes closed which is even more impressive considering he uses finger-picking techniques as opposed to strumming. He becomes one with his guitar, dancing along with the phrases as each breath in leads up to a climax and each exhale makes its way to a resolution. Please, I beg you, do not sleep on unprocessed music without lyrics. You may be unmotivated to try it out, but Olita’s playing is both rewarding and stimulating. Although he has yet to publicly release original pieces, Olita possesses a unique sense of music theory and emotion that will lead him to compose and arrange without flaw. Final Thoughts After dabbling in a bit of these four very distinct sounds, I look forward to expanding my pursuit of new music. I find that the music you listen to at any given time in your life can bring back memories and feelings when you listen to it again in the future. Maybe some of these artists will become nostalgic for you at some point; maybe the artists they lead you to will. Even if you don’t relate to them, I hope you at least appreciate their artistry and recognize that to find some of the most innovative young artists, you don’t have to venture too far.

Before Operation Varsity Blues popularized college admissions discourse, large components of the competitive college admissions process already favored the rich and predominantly white. And as colleges have become increasingly competitive, the lengths to which students and parents will go to ensure spots at an “elite” institution have grown. Legacy and athlete admissions have come to the forefront of discussion as examples of unfair back doors into colleges, exemplifying the ways that wealth and privilege give students a “in” to college well before they even begin the admissions process. Sources struggle to find a specific definition of a “back door” into college admissions, but largely everyone agrees that there is one. When describing his scheme to parents, Rick Singer, the man who conducted Operation Varsity Blues,called the back door an“institutional advancement, which is 10 times as much money.” He followed up by saying, “If you wanna go through the back door, Harvard’s asking for $45 million … Stanford’s asking for $50 million.” Not all donations secure one’s spot at a school, but large enough sums of money do. But a donation smaller than $50 million can help you out if you have legacy — that is, if you are the child of a school’s alumni. At Harvard alone, legacy students comprise about 14% of the undergraduate student body, and at many elite universities, legacy status could make a student 25% more likely to get accepted than non-legacies. The Harvard admissions committee asserted that legacy preference “helps to cement strong bonds between the university and its alumni,” which the university values because it relies on these alumni for “financial support” in the form of donations. The — probably correct — assumption in the discussion around legacy consideration is that these students come from financially flourishing families. Harvard’s president, Lawrence Bacow, mentioned in a statement that legacy applicants are already some of the most qualified applicants that the school receives, so of course they would be admitted at a higher rate. Legacy students likely have access to the best high schools and summer programs to make them more competitive applicants preciselybecausetheir parents went to a prestigious college and likely receive a higher-than-average income. Why, with a$38.7 billion endowment, does Stanford really need to encourage alumni gifting by explicitly perpetuating a cycle of privilege? According tothe data Stanford submittedto the California state legislature in June of 2020, 16.2% of the class of 2023 were the children of Stanford graduates, and 1.5% of the class had no legacy status but had a record of family philanthropy noted in their file. These figures together are shockingly close to the composition of first-generation students in that same class, 18.5%. That year, Stanford’s admissions rate hit a record low of 4.34%. This past year, the class of 2025 hit another record low admissions rate of 3.95%. Former Stanford President John Hennessy stated in 2013 that the “admissions rate for legacy students is two or three times higher than the general population.” While Stanford hasn’t recently confirmed the accuracy of this multiplier for legacy students, these students still compose a significant portion of their classes. Yes, ultimately two or three times higher than 3.95 is not that large. When we’re working with numbers this small, however, any boost counts. In a pool of academically qualified applicants, the children of Stanford alumni get possibly admissions-winning boosts. But not everyone agrees that a “back door” comes solely in the form of financial gifts from a family to a college, and many have pointed to other factors that can increase a student’s likelihood of admission and dubbed them “back doors,” too. One increasingly popular move seems to be the most consistent back door across the board: athlete admissions.At Harvard, recruited athletes with high academic scores on Harvard’s scale of rating applicants are admitted at a staggering rate of 83%, while non-athletes with the same academic rank are only accepted at a rate of 16% — not to mention the school’s5% acceptance ratefor the general public. Athletics even trump legacy in terms of admissions preference, with athletes receiving a 48% bump. And playing a sport at a collegiate level in high school can costupward of $12,000in equipment, traveling, and tournament fees. Wealthy students even have an advantage in recruitment practices, because, according toa recent studyin the Harvard Educational Review, “due to their community and social networks, they are better at navigating this process.” A Washington Poststudy from 2019 found that 12% of Stanford’s undergraduate population is enrolled in a varsity sport. While not all of Stanford’s athletes are one-percenters, the money and time to play competitive sports in college gave many of them a significant admissions boost. As a final note, Stanford asserts that all of its students are academically qualified to attend its school. Legacy students and athletes have to maintain high GPAs and earn incredible test scores to even be considered — on top of that, athletes have to play their sport at a collegiate level in high school. The purpose of this article is not to berate these students, but rather to point out that the wealthy and white have historically had access to higher education, and thus students of this demographic are more likely to carry legacy status and/or to be a competitive athletic applicant (requiring the time and financial resources to play their sport in high school . With increased numbers of applicants and a seemingly ever-lowering admissions rate, these “back doors” of legacy and athlete admissions tend to favor those who come from a wealthy, WASP-y background.

stanforddaily_2022_53,"I took an extra long winter break this year. With classes moved online for the first few weeks of the quarter, I decided to stay home in Los Angeles. The extra time led me to looking through stacks and stacks of family photo albums, and one childhood photo of myself, in particular. I’m two years old or so, wearing socks and sandals, standing in the yard at home and clutching the day’s newspaper. Unfolded, the paper itself was probably as big as I was. I don’t remember this precise photo being taken, but returning to the image nevertheless brought to mind a rush of other memories. Growing up, my Sunday mornings began with the LA Times. For as long as I can remember, my dad and I would head down Franklin Avenue to the neighborhood grocery store and pick up a copy of the weekend edition. (The rare occasion that I was able to pay for the newspaper myself with the spare quarters in my pocket made me feel very adult. That was our ritual. Coming home, newspaper in hand, and sitting around the dining table to read the sports section. That was home. Ritual, however, is probably not a word I would have used to describe this routine until I got to Stanford and realized just how impactful these Sunday mornings were. Last fall, I took ENGLISH 180A: “Periodicity” — an early modern literature class that, among other topics, explores the inception of the English periodical in the eighteenth century. In one text that struck a particular cord with me, Kevis Goodman describes the ritualization of news consumption that envisions a routine mass ceremony, where readers look to the news each morning and night simultaneously. He writes, “The significance of this mass ceremony — Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel observed that newspapers serve modern man as a substitute for morning prayers — is paradoxical. It is performed in silent privacy, in the lair of the skull. Yet each communicant is well aware that the ceremony he performs is being replicated simultaneously by thousands (or millions of others.” It was the same sort of communion that I had experienced growing up — not just the action of reading itself, but the corresponding community and collective consciousness that it brought. Although, of course, the means of our news consumption continues to change into the 21st century, that very sentiment — the mutual forging of reasoning and understanding among the public — is what prompted me to join The Daily and what has kept me around for four years. This ritual of news production and consumption, especially sports reporting, has spanned my entire Stanford experience and perhaps facilitated some of the most meaningful connections I’ve made. Before even enrolling as a student, The Stanford Daily brought me community. In a makeshift high school reunion over Admit Weekend, Sarah Wishingrad (then a graduating Stanford senior encouraged me to join The Daily, recounting on Meyer Green her own fond memories over the past four years. Fast forward five months, and Bobby Pragada was enthusiastically convincing me to choose the sports section over a table at the activities fair. And soon enough I had found a new, just as meaningful, ritual. Instead of reading about USC football with my parents, it was editing Jack Golub’s column with him in Soto at 2 a.m., attending midweek football press conferences and walking to Treehouse to pick up pizza for production. Most nights, the routine, however, was just arguing that we print a sports article on the front page. Without Claire Wang’s willingness to take a chance on me as a freshman managing editor, I probably would not have bonded with my roommate in the same depth. My roommate played varsity lacrosse (a sport totally foreign to this Angeleno , so when tasked with editing coverage of the Stanford team, I asked her to explain the ins and outs of the sports she loved. Those conversations, with me sitting on my bed and her across the narrow dorm room on hers, or similar ones with my student-athlete friends Mason Gonzalez and Allie Jones, among others, brought us all closer over the course of the school year. Through these friendships, I forged another layer of my Stanford routine. Writing and editing, especially as I assimilated to Stanford during my freshman year, gave me a sense of purpose, focus and community — both within and beyond 456 Panama Mall. As a leader in a traditionally male section and traditionally male field at-large, perhaps the most important personal takeaway of working as a sports journalist and editor was harnessing my voice. Often theonly woman in the room(and probably the youngest, too , I had to advocate for myself and what I believed in. Perhaps that was construed as being insubordinate at times, but I would like to think that my presence and efforts helped other women carve out their own places in the sports journalism world. The necessity of speaking out and writing’s potential to prompt change became especially apparent during my coverage of36 Sports Strongand, in particular, themen’s volleyball team’sefforts to save their program. Speaking to players and alumni showed me in practice the way that journalism could bring people together. But hearing about theintended cuts, simultaneous to sports around the country being put on holddue to the pandemic, also made me realize how devastated I would be if a team/club/organization that I cared about was suddenly defunct or out of reach. More than anything, it made me appreciate the people, routines and laughs that The Daily has brought me. I’ll take those memories with me, like the childhood photo albums, long after I leave this university — freshman year autograph sessions after my full-page graphic on the baseball team and muddy Ink Bowl Games and headline games and Zoom Kahoots and breaking down Pac-12 football in EVGR with Daniel Martinez-Krams and interviews outside Jimmy V’s with Zach Zafran and weekends at the beach with Tammer Bagdasarian and Cooper Veit and Drew Silva’s NFL jerseys as we wait for TAP on Draft Day and FloVolleyball games with Madeline Grabb and trivia nights with Benjamin Zaidel. I decided at the start of my senior year that I would save a printed copy of each week’s Stanford Daily so that, by graduation in June, I would have a journalistic record of my final year on campus. So, in packing up my undergraduate dorm room for the final time, I find myself in an oddly familiar position. Like the photograph from 20 years ago, I stand with an armful of newspapers, ready for whatever’s next. Cybele Zhang 22 J.D. 26 is a Senior Staff Writer from Los Angeles.

crimson_2022_78,"Two years ago, as the Harvard student population was getting kicked off campus, I was celebrating my entrance into legal adulthood. On Saturday, March 14, 2020, I turned 18, the first of what I assumed would be the many steps toward the gradual transition from adolescence to adulthood. The transition I hoped would be picturesque and idyllic, however, was abruptly compressed by the entrance of Covid-19 onto the world stage. My 18th birthday marked the beginning of quarantine, an event that precluded me from properly saying goodbye to many of my close friends, some of whom I have not had the opportunity to see since. This is not a unique experience, but rather one I share with countless of my classmates. Covid threw most of us into a foreign new world, with little guidance or precedent on how to navigate it. Alone on campus, the Class of 2024 in particular felt the full effect of the break of tradition. There was no First Chance Dance, no Harvard-Yale, no Commencement, Visitas, or Activities Fair. Annenberg remained empty, and instead of getting Quadded by a mass of Cabotians outside of my dorm, we got Quadded by an anti-climactic Zoom meeting. Covid-19 was like the little kid who, seeing a single file line of ants, steps on the middle, leaving the latter portion confused and with no path to follow. We arrived with no signposts or manuals, surrounded by stories of traditions we were missing and buildings we weren’t allowed to enter. We didn’t know what we were missing, what a normal year at Harvard was meant to be like. Quite frankly, though, we were the better for it. As a freshman in what was supposed to be an intensely competitive and at times formalized social scene, I was thankful for this social vagary. The Class of 2024 is uniquely socially interconnected, owing to the pandemic and the lack of formalized sports, clubs, and societies by which our social lives would have been defined. Friendships were made that crossed what would normally have been solid social divisions. Relationships were had by people who typically would never have even crossed paths. The lack of in-person classes, clubs, and dining halls left people wandering around campus, introducing themselves to anyone who would listen. The fact is, Covid-19 turned Harvard’s campus into virgin land, ready to be explored by a group of idealistic freshmen who didn’t yet know that Falafel Corner is a better late night food location than Jefe’s. Friends were made in the Mather courtyard, rather than Annenberg. Going into Boston became a weekly event, instead of a perpetually postponed plan. This newfound freedom from tradition was’t limited to the Class of 2024, however. When we fnally returned to campus, only one class had experienced a full in-person academic year. The lack of experience allowed the entire student body to embrace an idealism that we’ve only felt when we first stepped foot on campus with our lanyard around our neck. For all intents and purposes, the pandemic made us all freshmen. There’s value in being a freshman. With no elder guidance, there’s no one to tell you that you can’t organize a walkout while the University President is giving a speech. Thinking like a freshman has led students to run for the Undergraduate Council with a campaign to overhaul the entire system, or create an Instagram account devoted to imbuing within Harvard the school spirit of a state school. The pandemic eroded the forceful authority of history and replaced it with the promise of a future latent with possibility. Sure, the Institute of Politics may be historically full of cutthroat wannabe presidents, but this post-pandemic generation didn’t know that this was their role to play when they first comped. The past culture of competition, toxicity, and disillusionment is a positive feedback loop that can only be broken by something as jarring as a global pandemic. Covid-19 shook us awake from that four year long trance that had many of us shuffling through Harvard, stepping where we were told to step. It changed the status quo, allowing us to ask questions of what we used to think was a fixed system. Traditions were lost, but new ones were made. Change is hard, and many times painful. But, many times, though, change is good. Manny A. Yepes ’24, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Cabot House. Have a suggestion, question, or concern for The Crimson Editorial Board? Clickhere."
wildcat_arizona_2022_46,"An illustration of Tucson’s Sentinel Peak, also known as “A” Mountain by Mary Ann Vagnerova. Look, this is a safe place to be vulnerable. You don’t need to be ashamed to admit it. We’ve all been there. Face-to-face with some mountain with nothing but the thought, “That’s a lot of rocks.” Perhaps your experience was more impactful, though hopefully not in a literal sense. If you’ve spent any amount of time in Tucson, you have seen a myriad of mountains in every direction. While you might not be the type to rank mountains in your free time, the massive Mount Lemmon would likely come to mind first if you did. However, somewhere on your list, you would eventually be forced to mention Sentinel Peak: a mountain known more commonly as “A” Mountain. While it may not be the best mountain in Tucson, it’s certainly the best “A” Mountain. I wasn’t always the mountain enthusiast that I am today. I was once like many others, looking at and instantly forgetting every hill I saw. They blended together into one amorphous gray blob in my memories. Then, everything changed. However, it’s at this point that I must disclose a potential conflict of interest before I go any further. The “A” Mountain that came to my mind when you and I shared that insightful observation about rocks was not Sentinel Peak in Tucson, but rather Hayden Butte in Tempe. I attended Arizona State University during my undergraduate years and even guided tours of the campus. As a tour guide, I always began at the base of the hill that graced the smoggy Tempe skyline. “A” Mountain is a local icon in Tempe, reminding over 60,000 students what rocks look like. It’s involved in numerous traditions tied to ASU school spirit and athletics, as well as a very popular place for local teens to practice their skills with a lighter and some kind of pungent incense. I had made the brief trek many times to gaze over the flour mill and man-made lake during my time there. Never once did it occur to me, a Tempe native, that the only “A” Mountain I had ever known was just a hill. When I first moved to Tucson, I set eyes upon a proper mountain, adorned with a single block letter just as I had seen in my hometown. I had no prior knowledge of Sentinel Peak and readied myself to defend one of the few iconic attractions of my home from mimicry. “How could the imitation be better than the original?” I rhetorically asked myself for the sake of moving forward with this article. But Sentinel Peak is the indisputable, bonafide original “A” Mountain, and Hayden Butte is nothing but a sloppy copy. If ASU were somehow a person rather than a part-time academic institution and full-timetax-exempt real estate company, they might ask you to consider the history before you jump to conclusions about which mountain is better. They might even ask how one “A” Mountain can be fairly compared to another, but since ASU is not a person, I don’t have to answer that question. In fairness, the whole picture is important to keep in mind as I attempt to convince you to have strong feelings about a natural rock formation. First, there’s a height difference which – for those who have not spent as much time thinking about the two “A” Mountains as me – may be surprising to know as Sentinel Peak is nearly twice the size of Hayden Butte! It may also be helpful to know that Hayden Butte is younger than its more impressive counterpart in Tucson. Hayden Butte is thought to have been inhabited between750 and 1450 AD, whereas Sentinel Peak has potentially been home to civilization for over4,000 years. It also might explain why ASU was late to the party when it came time for the newest fad of putting letters on tall rocks. Not only did soon-to-be ASU not put up their letter “A” until 2 years after the University of Arizona, they originally put an “N” for the Tempe Normal School. It took a fulltwo name changesand 21 years before ASU decided to embarrass Hayden Butte with an “A” of its own. Since Hayden Butte is the little brother in numerous ways, it may seem unfair to criticize it. However, since both mountains will get to laugh into eternity as they watch future generations of my family become the dirt that will one day cover its immortal facade, I think we can have a little fun right now. The two peaks share more than a history ofclaiming a site of Indigenous significancefor a vanity project in the form of the letter “A.” Both involve the same sensory blend of loud music and the pungent aroma of some very strong incense carried by a gentle desert breeze. One very important difference is the location. As mentioned earlier, when you stand atop Hayden Butte, you are limited in your view to Downtown Tempe and reminded that this humble hill is the lone preserved natural habitat in a sea of apartments and corporate realty. When fortunate enough to summit Sentinel Peak, you can’t help but be humbled and awestruck by the Saguaro National Park to the west and Catalina Mountains to the north. The area around Sentinel Peak is home to many more species of flora and fauna which make the destination ideal for connecting with nature. While it still seems shameless of ASU to give their mountain the same name and decorative “A” merely 113 miles from the other, the mimicry goes both ways. In a rare moment of triumph for Hayden Butte, only it holds claim to the first mountainside performance of appreciation towards healthcare workers when the “A” in Tempe waspainted bluea month before the“A” in Tucson. It’s a sweet gesture visible to all the local healthcare workers overburdened with fighting the spread of COVID-19. It’s a gesture that would have been more meaningful as a student at ASU at the time, and current medical student, if either university had backed it up with more support such as time off for the healthcare workersexperiencing unprecedented burnout. But if you’re going to hand out empty gestures, it’s at least nice to be the first to do it. RELATED:OPINION: Out-of-state students should vote in their home state As Homecoming approaches, there will be no shortage of discussion about the ways in which the UA is superior to ASU. I just ask that you not forget about the mountains. I ask that when you think of Hayden Butte, pity the hill unfortunate to live in the shadow of a mountain twice its size with an original claim to its name. Hayden Butte is a sweet little hill that makes for a fine outdoor walk to get a better view of Tempe. Go and visit both, learn their history and come to your own conclusions. Regardless of whether you agree with me or not, these two mountains need our help to preserve for future generations to compare. There is a longstanding history of mountaintop vandalism from students at both universities. In addition to frequent repainting in the opposing team’s colors, the “A” in Tempe was also onceblown up by dynamiteand the nearby rocks on both mountains are frequently obscured by graffiti and trash. We must remind ourselves that beneath the shared facade of school spirit, both mountains serve as historic sites of early civilization, and are home to a diverse array of regional plants and animals. Regardless of who wins the football game, rest assured that you’ll still be able to look down on ASU from 3,000 feet above the ground.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_20,"When Kanye West, now legally Ye,bought a housedirectly across the street from his estranged wife Kim Kardashian many people thought nothing of it. After all, he’s just trying to be an involved co-parent, right? Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Recently, it has become clear that West’s motives go beyond providing for his children. He has had many social mediaoutburstswhere he has publicly attacked Kardashian, her parenting choices and her current partner. In addition, West spent many months living inWyomingaway from his family, ultimately leading to Kardashian asking for a divorce. West’s erratic behavior online, combined with his decision to purchase the house directly across the street from Kardashian paints a clear picture of domestic abuse. To some, West’s erratic posting on Instagram can seem comical or just another attempt to get media attention. Similarly,media outletshave consistently reported on the abuse but framed it as just another batch of celebrity gossip. However, for many who have witnessed or been victims of emotional abuse, it seems concerningly familiar. In the past few months, West has been sharing aggressive posts to his 15 million followers. The posts largely target his former wife and mother to his children, Kardashian, and her new partner, Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson. The string of heated social media posts began inthe fallwhen Kardashian was first linked with Davidson. However, recently they quickly escalated with West’s outrage over his daughter North’s presence on TikTok. On Instagram, in all capital letters, West harassed Kardashian for allowing their daughter to be on TikTok“AGAINST HIS WILL.”While Kardashian has been trying her best to ignore her estranged husband’s cries for attention on social media, his decision to involve their children was apparently too far. In response, Kardashian issued a statement calling West’s outbursts“painful” and “hurtful for all.” One painstakingly clear line that West crossed during his social media tantrum was postingprivate messagesbetween Kardashian and himself to his social media. By exposing these private conversations without consent, he is harassing Kardashian. Even further, West mentions in his post that he had to find Kardashian’s new number, as she had changed it to avoid further harassment from him. West’s behavior is akin to stalking Kardashian after she made it clear that the public blowouts and abuse must stop. The constant intimidation on social media turned to physical stalking when West reportedly startedshowing upto places where Kardashian and Davidson had planned to spend time. West’s actions must be acknowledged for what they are: abuse. In many of hisposts, West attempts to use his followers to directly manipulate the custody situation of his children. He asked his followers foradviceon what he should do to get his children back — influencing many of his followers to immediately support West and attack Kardashian for anything that he might have brought up. This only further added to the sources of harassment already targeted at Kardashian, as fans of West flooded herInstagramcomment sections. In another string of abusive Instagram posts, West repeatedly blames Davidson, who he refers to as “Skete” for tearing apart his family — even going as far as telling his fans toscream at and tauntDavidson if they ever saw him in person. West’s behavior towards his ex-wife’s new partner is potentially putting Davidson at risk for physical harm. West’s attacks show that he not only feels possessive over Kardashian, but that he also doesn’t see himself and Kardashian as equals. Why is it that West can start new relationships, yet when Kardashian does it, it’s tearing their family apart? West’s double standards also display many of his misogynistic tendencies. After all, Kardashian isn’t the first woman West has publicly harassed. At the2009 Video Music Awards, he stormed the stage and interrupted singer Taylor Swift, who was only 19 at the time, after she won Best Female Video of the year. This moment would become infamous in pop culture as it represented West’s impulsive and degrading behavior. More recently, he accusedBillie Eilishof “dissing” his friend Travis Scott when she stopped her concert in Atlanta to stop a fan who was struggling. Although Eilish never mentioned Scott’s name, West still publicly demanded she apologize. As evident by the number of people West’s outbursts have affected, it is clear that he is repeatedly abusive and degrading. While it is no excuse for his actions, it is important to recognize West’s battles with mental illness. Mental illnesses can often have effects that extend past those of the diagnosed individual. West was diagnosed withbipolar disorder, which could further compound the outbursts and levels of abuse. However, the greatest effect is on Kardashian — who is being forced to endure this emotional violence publically. Kanye West is publicly abusing Kim Kardashian, yet media and news outlets continue to latch on to his behavior as mere juicy gossip. A dangerous choice, as it normalizes abusive behavior between celebrities. West’s repetitive abuse must be publicly recognized from all sides and, most importantly, he must leave Kardashian alone. Hollywood cannot keep covering up abuse. The time is now to hold West accountable. Claire Schad is an Opinion Staff Writer. She can be reached atschadc@uci.edu."

The divestors willdecrythe makeup of the Harvard Management Company’s investment portfolio, raising consistent and often successful dissent to push for divestment fromfossil fuels,prisons, andPuerto Rican debt. The workers willcondemnHarvard’s stingy and inhumane employment practices: With a $53 billion endowment and a $283 million budget surplus, why did the graduate student union need tofighttooth and nail to gain a measly cost-of-living raise in one of the most expensive cities in the country? Why were workersthreatened with potential layoffs andleft unpaidduring Covid-19? The aspiring populists willwarnagainst the University’s acceptance of government relief funds. Flush in cash, Harvard should never accept federal funds doled out in crisis. Use your endowment, our aspiring Josh Hawleys willchidethe administration, and never accept outside help. Harvard hasheededtheir advice in the past, but they will doubtless raise their voices in the future as well. The native Bostonians willdenounceHarvard’s insufficient contributions to the city’s Payment In Lieu Of Taxes program. In 2020, the Universityfailedfor the eighth consecutive year to pay the full amount requested by Boston officials as compensation for tax revenue lost due to Harvard’s nonprofit status. Given the massive direct and indirect costs that Harvard’s expansion into Allston and Longwoodinflictsupon residents, our institution —with its Slovenian economy-sized endowment — can well afford to pay the relatively insignificant $12.8 million requested under PILOT. I’m certainly sympathetic to each of these lines of endowment discontent. But to me, none of them grasp at the fundamental question at play in this absurd drama of abundance. For the most part, criticism of the endowment and its role in Harvard’s austerity politics accepts the premise that it’s OK for a university to operate a hedge fund in the first place. It is not only that the types and methods of HMC investment are wrong; rather, it is the very logic of constructing an unlimited endowment that is immoral and in violation of the core values of the Harvard community. Fifty-three billion dollars is a lot of money, with a lot of capacity for good. It’s enough toexpandSection 8 housing to cover all eligible households,quadruplethe size of the Head Start preschool program, orendhunger for one-tenth of the starving world — all with $10 billion left over, still more thanall but ahandfulof American universities have in their endowments. To state the obvious, Harvard is not pursuing this type of massive, system-scale social intervention. Year over year, 95 percent of the endowment is held in invested funds, with a5 percent (and often less yearlypayoutcovering only one-third of the University’s operating budget. Falsely claiming scarcity, the HMC manages its funds under a conservative mindset of austerity —stonewallingnecessary change,eschewingtransparency, andreducingits support of the University at the drop of a financial hat — all whilepaying out$31 million yearly to its six top investment managers. To live up to its core obligations as an affluent institution in democratic society, Harvard must cease its deference to this imagined scarcity. Universities’ role in democracy includes democratic fiscal action: they have a responsibility to put their resources toward the development of an active, educated, and healthy citizenry. For a democratic institution with such pecuniary abundance, it’s not enough to educate a few thousand “citizen-leaders” each year. Harvard must use its resources to enable as many people as possible to become citizen-leaders beyond the walls of the University. In a society suffering poverty, homelessness, and climate crisis under the weight of stifling institutional austerity, Harvard’s endowment is a hoarder’s trove, an inexcusably unjust concentration of affluence. In recognition of this truth, Harvard should put an end to its unjustifiable greed and begin devoting its massive resources to the public good. So let’s defund the HMC! Enough with the false logic of boundless growth and endless hoarding — let’s set reasonable limits on Harvard’s accumulation of wealth that safeguard the University’s sustained operations while using its abundant excess to fulfill its democratic obligations to the society in which we live. Waging our resources as a weapon of the social good, let’s spend, spend, spend! For too long, Harvard has focused on truth at the cost of goodness. A logic of unlimited accumulation has blinded the institution from its commitments to democracy. But it’s not too late — nearly 400 years of history, however heavy a burden, is not destiny. Replacing veritas with veritas popularis, let’s push a new generation of Harvard humans to pursue the democratic truth to which our University is obliged. Noah B.

stanforddaily_2022_9,"At this late hour of Stanford history, can anyone hope to bring up a serious subject in a dining hall? Every so often I listen in on campus table talk, only to be a little disappointed. All of it seems general — all of it about asking for the hundredth time which courses someone is taking, or what they plan to major in, or whether they, too, find the pollock objectionable. Too often when someone advances toward a serious idea they retire swiftly, conversation palls, and the table scrambles to lower the tone of conversation. Kanye West (one hears , is a bad human being. Now, what of the latest Fizz post? Such banalities dominate not just the talk at dining hall tables, but the talk in section, in lounges, in Main Quad: everywhere, in short, that Stanford students gather. And yet, each of these students, if whisked away for half an hour, is not poor company; they all have opinions on serious matters; they are willing to talk about them at some length. Why, then, is Stanford not made up of a thousand Bloomsburies? Why have so many extraordinary individuals made for a culture that is altogether unextraordinary? That the social life of Stanford is in a bad way is by now a commonplace. Articles have been written about it inPalladium, TheStanfordDaily, and theStanford Review. Each of these writers has made much of the party scene, has cited the administration’s efforts to thwart or dampen it as proof of Stanford’s decadence, and is agreed that the brilliancy, creativity, and irreverence that once distinguished Stanford have long gone. The college has slunk into a fatal torpor from which it is unlikely to awake. They are right, of course. Parties do signal irreverence. Bureaucrats do meddle where they shouldn’t. But much as I agree with them on what the University is now, I can’t make myself share their vision of what it ought to be. The troubles of Stanford aren’t, I think, purely social: at bottom they are intellectual and spiritual. Stanford isn’t to be judged by how often its undergraduates drink or party, important as those things are. Stanford, in my view, is to be judged by its table talk. The word “spiritual” may make you recoil — I’m skeptical of it myself — but the University does have a spirit, and I shall try to explain what I mean by it. In the first place, the University exists so that its students may lead the life of the mind: so they may seek truth and search for beauty, and in so doing come to recognize the limits of those pursuits. Of course, the University does much else besides: it prepares students for their careers, offers them something of an education, and helps them along on the way to adulthood. All of that is good and important. But to be a student at a University is, above all, to accept an invitation to the intellectual life. For each of us has a complex of impressions and attitudes and values that, even if it doesn’t fully stand up to questioning, supports all that we build on top of it. Like an invisible armature this framework of ideas shapes every new belief we have about art, or science, or politics, or what you will. Many of these beliefs are bequests from authority, and as time passes many of them inevitably come to show their seams. There are of course those who’ve never doubted the assumptions they’ve lived by; they are, in the psychologist William James’ phrase, the “once-born.” But most of us doubt: we can’t help it, our strength goes that way, and once we do we are, as it were, born again. “In the religion of the twice-born,” Jamessays, “the world is a double-storied mystery. Peace cannot be reached by the simple addition of pluses and elimination of minuses from life. Natural good is not simply insufficient in amount and transient, . . . there lurks a falsity at its very being. . . . it can never be the thing in tended for our lasting worship.” Which in other words means that the twice-born make life more trouble than it needs to be. And quite right, too. People who are successful in a worldly sort of way are often opposed to this; they are convinced they know what’s what, and in their brisk, aggressive way refuse to entertain a pure idea for more than a minute. I detest and fear such people. They seem to me coarse, their worldview gauche and bereft of beauty. College should be a protest against their ways; and to accept an offer of admission is, I’m convinced, to heed the call to be born again. But heed how? William Blake inJerusalemhas the angel Los put it like this — I must Create a System, or be enslav’d by another Mans I will not Reason & Compare: my business is to Create Which Los does, in “fury & strength.” Once an old view has given way, we the twice-born must arm ourselves again; and to refortify ourselves like this, Blake says, is “to create a system.” He is clear, too, about what happens to those who don’t do this: they are enslav’d by another Mans. One does not adopt a system, in Blake’s sense, as one chooses a new pair of socks or a new shade of highlighter. It’s far more vital and profound than that. And we needn’t answer alone, either. The call is sounded not just to individuals but to all of us together. No one can drift alone in the world of ideas; no one can spin a good system in mid-air without even once having made contact with the world. If a system is to have any value it must evolve through talk, out of some wish to make sense of the world together. That feeling of being bound to one another, not by some set of courses, not by some quirk of identity, but by a shared intellectual quest, is what the college experience ought to be about. That, as much as Eurotrash, must give the University its spirit. For everything is against the likelihood that an individual can cultivate himself on his own. As a culture draws on, as a tradition lengthens, it can no longer be possessed whole and entire by a single individual. Plays and paintings and novels and sonatas all vie for our attention; all of this must be marked, docketed, filed away; and once that is done, a little of it must be enjoyed. The second we may do alone; the first however needs institutions. As stewards of this material, libraries, museums, theaters, and opera houses all serve their turn, but the greatest steward of all is the University. I’d bet that this is the ideal most people cherish of the University. They may say that the University as it stands does no such thing. But if I, a foreigner, were to ask an American where the best and highest of American culture ought to be embodied, he would point to the University. This, he would say, is where men and women go to cultivate themselves. Of course, a quick look out the window will disprove him. The very set-up of the classroom conspires against him. There the professor is supreme: she hands out the grades; he directs the conversation. One need never talk sense to anyone else. After a while the stop-start rhythm of the quarter system takes over; one ends the quarter no better acquainted with the other students than at the beginning. The next class beckons, except the humanities curriculum has grown so fragmented and perfunctory that nothing need ever build on anything else, and the teachers must presume their new batches of students—not unjustly—to be in a state of perpetual ignorance about everything. These complaints aren’t new. I daresay anyone who’s taken a Stanford course has had them. The classroom is not where we go to cultivate ourselves, which is why, perhaps, most people I know who take the intellectual life at all seriously chase the ideas that intrigue them all on their own. But it’s a lonely pursuit; always one feels an idea pressing in, nudging insistently, crying out to be talked over, only to find no one to talk it over with. And life gallops on; the University is a mint; there is money to be made and far too many people wishing to make it. Before one knows it, crass commercial necessity has sent the idea, whatever it was, back into hiding. But why shouldn’t ideas be at the forefront of the University’s social life? Why shouldn’t the life outside classrooms be devoted—if only in part—to questions of the mind? Why shouldn’t we discuss Whitman or Keynes or Galois every so often at dinner? And why, instead of managing it ourselves, should we ask the University to foster this? For I don’t think it can; or, in any case, I doubt it can do better than to point to its classes and lectures, and ask what use we have made of those. No; if ideas are to matter at the University, they must matter to us, its students. So long as we cordon off the social from the intellectual, it is futile to take the University to task for its air of deep malaise. Is this a strange conception of the University? Our image of the intellectual is of the lonely recluse shut up in her room, scribbling away on note-paper: Sylvia Plath perhaps, or Emily Dickinson. It would not have surprised the ancients, though. Socrates talked in the marketplace; the Indian rishis gabbled together in the forest. Nor would it have surprised a certain type of Oxford student. InThe Moving Toyshop, an Oxonian who reaches Oxford late at night is momentarily worried about finding a bed to sleep in— . . . suddenly he smiled. Such things didn’t matter in Oxford. He had only to climb over the wall of his college (he’d done it often enough in the old days, God knows and sleep on a couch in somebody’s sitting-room. Nobody would care; the owner of the sitting-room would be neither surprised nor annoyed. Oxford is the one place in Europe where a man may do anything, however eccentric, and arouse no interest or emotion at all. In what other city, Cadogan asked himself, remembering his undergraduate days, could one address to a policeman a discourse on epistemology in the witching hours of the night, and be received with neither indignation nor suspicion? Such scenes may no longer play out at Oxford: I wouldn’t know. Perhaps after Oscar Wilde no clever student has ever walked through Magdalen College. But truth or fantasy, isn’t it a lovely idea, and a lovely ideal? For why shouldn’t the intellectual life be a public affair, communal and companionable? I’m not asking for a crowd of undergraduates all grave, withdrawn,sérieux. I’m asking instead for the college that Cadogan remembers—a light and playful place, whose students have nothing of the solemnity of a cloistered disciplinarian, but a puckish intelligence that glides smoothly and quietly, apparently still, but that then, with a mischievous wink, sails off and away. And so I don’t think I differ so drastically from the writers who wrote the articles for Palladium or the Daily or the Review. Our call is for the same thing: for spontaneity above all, for a fellowship of the mischievous. I’d only add that matters of the spirit come before matters of the flesh. I’ll close with a Tennyson poem. In “The Palace of Art,” an artist decides to shut himself up within the lonely vision of a higher intellect, and bids his soul build a towering palace for him where he may spend the rest of his days in contemplation. However, the soul quickly finds the isolation of the palace intolerable; and she seeks to purge her guilt instead in “a cottage in the vale.” It’s hard to live in the Palace of Art—the advantages are so few, so unobvious. One can’t say one becomes more moral, more tolerant, more popular, more cheerful, more sexually successful, by living there. The life of the mind defends itself by surviving, or by giving a pleasure so rich yet so obscure as to be beyond analysis. It is its own ground for being. And hardly anyone lives there forever, either. It does get tiring. Like the artist in the poem, one may decide the open country is better (or the marketplace, or the office cubicle . But a student who has been issued an invitation there, as we’ve all been, is obliged to make use of it. It’s only proper to pass at least once through its halls: to treat coffee and conversation as ends in themselves. True, we can’t go on forever; I don’t suppose that we can talk about Truth and Beauty in the abstract always, because after all the coffee has been drunk and every half-formed opinion aired, the abstract really does need to be freshened by contact with the concrete. Life must be lived outside the Palace, in the open air with the wind blowing, where the card-house theories of undergraduates can hardly hope to stand. But where else but the Palace can the foolishness of youth hold forth on questions that elude even the august serenity of age? Despite the futility, the extravagance, the pretentiousness of the endeavor, the Palace of Art must be purified; and it cannot be purified by the lonely aesthete shut up in his tower, but only if all mankind comes therein to dwell, even for a time. Or so at any rate I’ve often thought, sitting in Wilbur Dining, overhearing the conversation. A hundred undergraduates are venturing a hundred opinions aboutMidnightsand boba. TikTok, it turns out, is even more important than we’d imagined. Affirmative action is “like, good.” The broccoli is under-seasoned. The pollock is unpalatable. And so it goes. But it would be uncharitable, even on this showing, to think them content with the laziness, the small talk, or the broccoli and the pollock. All that free interchange of idea and opinion I have called for does not exist yet; but the desire for it must be there, gestating, underneath. Sometimes I remember the young boy who ferried Johnson and Boswell to Greenwich, and reminded Johnson of Orpheus on the voyage of the Argo; and who, whenasked, “What would you give, my lad, to know about the Argonauts?” — said proudly, loftily, memorably, “Sir, I would give all I have.” That boy has kindred souls at Stanford yet. We have only to call them forward. David Neese is a junior studying physics. He is not as curmudgeonly as this article would have you think. In his free time he likes to play the piano, listen to Scriabin and read Dostoevsky. Ayush Majumdar is a junior studying computer science. He is just as curmudgeonly as this article would have you think. In his free time, he enjoys writing & translating fiction and reading British & Bengali literature."
wildcat_arizona_2022_11,"Large heart-shaped balloons float outside of the Forbes building on the University of Arizona campus on Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2018. “Love Yourself,” “practice self love,” “put yourself first” are phrases that are heard and seen often in our society and on social media. But what is self-love anyways? The Merriam-Webster dictionarydefines self-love as “an appreciation of one’s own worth or virtue.” Self-love is not just done through words or looking in the mirror and saying “I love you” to yourself; it goes far beyond this. It’s more than just saying a few positive affirmations and moving on with your day. Self-love is when you accept yourself for who you are, treat yourself with kindness, don’t compare your life to the lives of others, put yourself first and take care of and appreciate yourself. Leslie Ralph is a clinical psychologist at Counseling and Psych Services at the University of Arizona, and she is also the coordinator of mental health promotion. RELATED:OPINION: Is pretty privilege real? “The most basic way I think of self-love and self-compassion is treating yourself like somebody worth caring about and worth taking an active interest in, and then, by extension, choosing to take care of ourselves as if we are somebody worth taking care of,” Ralph said. An article byMedical News Todayexplains the concept of self-love by stating, “for many people, the concept of self-love might conjure images of tree-hugging hippies or cheesy self-help books. But, as many psychology studies attest, self-love and -compassion are key for mental health and well-being, keeping depression and anxiety at bay.” The journey to find self-love can be difficult and it takes time. It’s not something we are able to accomplish overnight. We are our biggest critics, and it can be hard to appreciate ourselves for who we are and let go of small mistakes and challenges that we run into. “I think because we’re with our own selves 24/7 and so we are very intimately aware of things that feel like a big struggle,” Ralph said. Ralph explains that the “insider view” we have of ourselves and our own life can sometimes make the self-love and compassion journey difficult for us. RELATED:OPINION: Let’s talk about love bombing When we don’t show ourselves self-love and self-compassion it often means that we are giving into the negative self-talk and thoughts, neglecting our own feelings and not doing things to make ourselves happy or feel our best. Practicing self-love and compassion is beneficial for our mental health, well-being and happiness. There are small steps that we can take to practice self-love and self-compassion in our daily lives. For example, listening to our thoughts and stopping the negative self-talk and thoughts we may have about ourselves. Treat yourself how you would treat your best friends and family members. “Start prioritizing our own self care just in daily life. Asking ourselves things like how do I want to feel today or how do I feel today, and then choosing to do something about it,” Ralph said.

Every single break, whether it’s in December or in April, I think about all the cool places I promised myself to go during the semester and how I didn’t go to any of them. It’s so easy to slip into the monotony of school and abandon your hopes and dreams of learning every bus line in Vancouver. I relate to the feeling of being trapped on campus. I moved to UBC in the middle of my first year, and because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself confined to my room in Totem Park, the Forestry Tim Hortons and maybe The Nest if I was feeling adventurous and ready to trek through an unfamiliar campus. But as I spent the summer and this past academic year in Vancouver, I’ve pushed myself to explore the city and you should, too. Put that Compass card to good use! Whether you’re “Vancity born-and-raised” or from a small town halfway across the world, Vancouver — or even the entire Lower Mainland — is a sprawling city filled with a million-and-one possible things to do during your downtime. Yeah, you have the touristy stuff like riding bikes on the Seawall, travelling to Granville Island for a rose quartz necklace so your POLI crush will fall in love with you or visiting Burnaby Village Museum (where thisbangerwas filmed , but there are tons of super cool things to do in Vancouver that you haven t already done a million times. Breaking through Blancais hard, especially when you don’tneedto. On (or near campus, you can get a coffee, go grocery shopping and grab drinks with friends. But it sucks to be nearing the end of the school year thinking, “I’ve only left campus a handful of times this semester and the furthest I’ve gone is to the Breka on Alma.” Vancouver appeals to many niches. There are so many people to see and places to go when there isn’t the looming threat of a global pandemic at the forefront of our minds (so maybe tuck this advice to the back of your head and save it for more precedented times . Though you must hear this almost a hundred times a day, the world really is your oyster. You can walk amongst the Lululemon culters in Kitsilano, explore the IKEAs in Coquitlam and Richmond or memorize the best bar at every 99 stop along Broadway. Not only will you have fun trying new things, but you’ll see that there is so much more to Vancouver and life as a student than hanging out at the Life Building and waiting for the 68. You can also see the city on a budget.Tons of things in Vancouver are free. You can look at flowers at Queen Elizabeth Park, go to the many beaches, visit Lafarge Lake in Coquitlam, explore Chinatown or head to the Vancouver Art Gallery on Tuesday evenings, when admission is by donation (although the city has severalfree galleries.

wildcat_arizona_2022_8,"Teenage femininity is a battle against every societal standard that is shoved down your throat from a young age. Teenage girls are consistently picked apart for their interests, hobbies and habits. Whether it is liking One Direction or sports, there is always someone there to comment on how obsessive they are or claim they are just trying to seek some form of attention or validation from others. The term “fangirl” comes to mind when I think of ways society has picked apart teenage girls. If you google “sports riots,” dozens of searches come up with the titles “top-12 insane sports riots,” “here are five American cities which rioted after sporting success,” and yet fans of boy bands are constantly ridiculed for their obsessive and dramatic tendencies. I don’t remember anyone setting a car on fire when Zayn left One Direction. Speaking of One Direction, in an article forStudy Breakswritten by Katherine McLaughlin, she detailed the issue of why One Direction was never taken seriously for their success. She said that “a group that is statistically extremely successful still faces some of the most intense social loathing of their time.” Is it a coincidence that their general fan base consisted solely of teenage girls? Not at all. I even remember feeling inclined to dislike One Direction when “What Makes You Beautiful” rose to popularity because of how much everyone in my sixth grade class seemed to complain when a few girls requested our teacher to play the song. It’s not even the question of whether their music was good, people were solely hating on them because of who loved them. Analise Bruno wrote in an article for theViking Timesthat “this culture often puts impressionable girls under the microscope and perpetuated the idea that we all only like things that are weird, shallow, basic, or done for the direct attention of guys which makes it hard for us to like or do anything without the looming fear of being judged.” If a girl is interested in makeup, it doesn’t mean she is shallow and looking for attention. Enhancing beauty can work wonders for self-confidence and help a woman feel comfortable in a society that is always looking to highlight her flaws. During a beauty secrets video withVogue, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez commented on this by saying, “there’s this really false idea that if you care about makeup, or if your interest is in beauty and fashion, that that’s somehow frivolous. But I actually believe these are some of the most substantive decisions that we make, and we make them every morning.” Whether you do full glam or just mascara for class, it doesn’t give anyone the right to claim that it is indicative of your character. TikTok is another rabbit hole of pushing narratives upon teenage girls and shaming them for their interests.Voxpublished an article where Rebecca Jennings wrote, “teen girls and their interests have always served as punchlines, but on TikTok, once enough teen girls publicly enjoy something, the backlash can grow even bigger.” This is later followed by “TikTok accelerates meaningless cultural cycles faster than any machine or platform ever has, which means that as soon as something gets popular enough, it’ll trigger a near-immediate backlash.” One example that immediately comes to mind is the sudden backlash making its way through TikToker Emily Uribe’s comment section. It seemed as if the world was rooting for her when she was posting herself engaged in mock interviews with comments similar to “can’t wait to see you doing this for real.” But now, she’s walking red carpets and interviewing movie stars while continuing to post on TikTok and is now met with comments like “Don’t tell me she’s serious” or simply “no” or “uh.” While her audience may have shifted, her comments used to be riddled with joy and genuine encouragement for this creator. Once she gained immense popularity and attention from magazines and media outlets, Uribe was suddenly met with criticism and hatred that wasn’t shared before. She’s finding success and being dragged down for it with faceless commenters claiming she’s not ready for it or is undeserving. What makes her any less deserving than her male counterparts finding their way to fame? As someone who was a teenage girl very recently, I can say confidently that my interests and hobbies have been poked fun at or even ridiculed for their frivolous nature. I’m going to continue to read and watch rom-coms, listen to One Direction and do my makeup when I want to because those are things I truly enjoy. Stop trying to put teenage girls into a box or corner for one aspect of themselves. Women are multifaceted and should not be treated as one-sided beings.

stanforddaily_2022_8,"In early June, there was a stir among the Stanford circles I tend to find myself in. Stanford alum Ginevra Davis ’22 had published an article in Palladium magazine titled “Stanford’s War on Social Life,” and everyone was talking about it, from current students and professors to alumni who graduated in the 90s. It was the coalescence of rumblings I’d heard from older students (those pre-covid ones about Stanford’s languishing social life — something I was seeing for myself as a transfer student who had just finished my first year. This was surprising to me; after all, I had transferred to Stanford in 2021 from the school whose unofficial motto was the place where “fun goes to die.” Yet, in my first quarter at Stanford, I found myself missing the unique community hubs that so easily brought people together at the University of Chicago: the student run coffee shops, each with its own personality (the one for indie kids, the one for econ bros and their adjacents, the one for more edgy, subversive “alt” students, etc… , the student center, even the silent Harper Library, which was a place for me to hang with friends and meet new people. The school where fun goes to die was somehow doing a better job at facilitating a flourishing social scene than the school which I was promised was so much fun that it basically felt like summer camp. When I was at UChicago, there was an active effort underway to make the school more appealing to the general high achieving high school student; essentially, to transfigure itself into more of an ivy league-type school. This involved embracing looser restrictions (at orientation, each dorm was told by residence staff that alcohol use was permitted in one’s room, which is evidenced throughResidential Life Policy’semphasis that consumption is only banned explicitly in common areas and a newcommunity-driven student life strategy. It seems to me that Stanford is heading in the opposite direction, embracing the “where fun goes to die” mantra that UChicago is trying so hard to shed. I decided to apply to transfer during my freshman fall at UChicago in 2019. I wanted to be at a school that was “more fun.” Now, that’s, of course, an extreme oversimplification of my reasoning to apply out. I had faced an emotionally draining fall quarter at UChicago with the sudden loss of one of my first and closest college friends, Matt. After that, nothing seemed quite the same. I felt stuck in time and space like a beetle trapped in amber. My once exciting future at UChicago was so quickly obscured from view, and my past happy memories there were filled with images of Matt. What was left for me was this troubled present. I couldn’t sleep at night and couldn’t stay awake in class. The oppressive gray skies of January and February were little help in uplifting me. So yes, what I needed was some levity and a little more sun. I sent out applications right before the pandemic sent us all home. When I was accepted to some schools, I faced a tough decision. Though I had a difficult fall, I had weathered through it and formed close friendships with people from different corners of campus. I would miss the Thursday wine nights and the late nights in the library with friends (our library was actually open late, and we could talk with friends without being glared at from across the room . I would miss the gothic architecture, the beauty of spring in Chicago’s south side, venturing into the city, jumping into the lake, and hosting bonfires. But what I didn’t realize I would miss until I had left for Stanford was how easy it was to meet new people. Even though UChicago is an urban campus where most upperclassmen live off campus, I had no trouble making friends across class years. I expected an even more vibrant community at Stanford whose campus was much more contained than UChicago’s. I was excited to have an intensely fun social life at Stanford, as many alumni assured me they had experienced. It would be so unlike my many gray days at UChicago. But, when I arrived at Stanford in the fall of 2021, I saw a dull and tired campus, one that had forgotten it was supposed to be the fun California school. Life here seemed sterile in a way, scrubbed of any imaginative inspiration. I spent much of my time working in my room, and I am someone that hates working in my room. But there were few social places to work on campus where you could meet new people. I felt awkward and unwelcome when I walked into the first floor of Green to absolute silence and stares from people as the squeak of my shoes seemed to fill the emptiness of the space. The lack of central, social working spaces was just the tip of the iceberg. Stanford has been eroding away traditions (such as Full Moon on the Quad and historical community hubs through the Neighborhood System. This was easy for them to do — there was an entire year of remote schooling in which traditions were not passed down to the incoming class, and so their demise was imminent. Though such traditions may seem frivolous, it is exactly these small, uniquely Stanford events that bring people together. Walking around campus, I felt that the cautious attitude of much of the administration had infected the student body, with few students trying to reclaim any sense of a normal college social life. Even the palm trees lining much of campus served as a taunting emblem of the broken promise of being the summer camp school. Some might say these opinions are trivial. After all, a school’s purpose is foremost the education of its students. Yet, I would argue that classes are one of the least important things about Stanford and college in general. Of course, the ways of thinking you encounter are incredibly valuable, but the facts and pure knowledge are a means to an end in learning. I know that in a few years, I might remember about 10% of everything I learned from my classes here, and that is a generous number. Rather, what makes college so valuable is the relationships you make with others across wide and varying backgrounds. Ultimately, these interactions will shape our values and outlooks and even our selfhood. But we must have access to abundant social interactions and involvements for such meaningful growth to take place. So, I implore you, Stanford, to embrace “fun” again, revitalize our unique campus culture, not simply for the enjoyment of the student body but to allow your students to build themselves into complex and diverse beings."
wildcat_arizona_2022_10,"PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: Women use makeup to fit into society’s constantly changing beauty standards. Makeup trends have changed throughout the decades to fit with the progression of how society thinks women should look. What does it mean to be beautiful? This is a question with an ever-changing answer. In our society women are expected to fit with the constantly changing beauty standards that have been set for them. In our world today beauty standards for women are high, almost unattainable to reach. Beauty standards are a part of women’s history, and women have always been put under pressure to look a certain way. The beauty standards can be seen in the media, whether it’s on social media, magazines, movies or tv shows. Beauty and the desire to be seen as beautiful is an obsession in our society, which is why many individuals will go to extreme lengths to fit what the current definition of beauty is. Taking a step back in time and looking at the history of what has been defined as “beautiful” over the years, beauty standards have changed. In the 1920s, the trend was shorter hair and many women began to follow this. The 1930s was a time when many individuals strived to have an hourglass figure and shape to their bodies. The 1980s was a time period when big hair was essential for beauty, and in the 1990s pale skin and skinny figures were what was glorified. RELATED:OPINION: The dangerous trends surrounding food on TikTok In the early 2000s women strived to have a flat toned stomach for low rise jeans and spent a lot of time in tanning beds to get a bronzed glow. In our world today, women spend thousands of dollars on hair extensions, lip fillers and cosmetic surgeries to look like the celebrities that are praised because of their beauty. Many women feel pressured to change their appearance to try their best to match society’s beauty standards. This could include dying their hair a different color, dressing a certain way, working out more to fit a specific body type and even cosmetic or plastic surgery. According toDoSomething.org, a survey found that more than 40% of women would consider cosmetic surgery. The changing definition of beauty and the standards set by society and the media can be toxic and harmful to women. Throughout history, women have felt the need to live up to and change themselves to match what is glorified and labeled as beautiful. The pressure put on women can be toxic and harmful, leaving those who don’t match the current definition of beauty feeling like they are not good enough. Dovecompleted a study called “The Real Truth About Beauty” where they found that only about 4% of women worldwide think of themselves as beautiful and 72% of women feel pressure to look beautiful. Many women lack confidence and society’s beauty standards that are set for us play a big role in this. “80% of women agree that every woman has something about her that is beautiful, but do not see their own beauty,” according to Dove’s research findings. The problem with beauty standards is that they are an unrealistic image that society has set for women to live up to. They frequently change throughout the years and women are expected to change themselves to fit the image if they want to be perceived as “pretty” or “beautiful.” Follow Julianna Strano onTwitter Julianna is a senior majoring in journalism and sociology.

ubyssey_2022_36,"March 7, 2022 Written byUbyssey news staff All year, we’ve been attending governance meetings and keeping an eye on what’s going on in the AMS, Senate and Board of Governors. We’re familiar with the issues and the pressures of each position in student government. This elections season, we talked to all the candidates, attended all the debates and fact-checked their claims and platforms. Here’s the result. We’re not here to tell you who to vote for, but we will be honest about each candidates’ strengths and weaknesses. Behold,The Ubyssey s guide to all of the 2022 AMS Elections candidates. Bhangu is one of two highly-qualified candidates running for AMS president in this year’s crowded field. She is part of the AMS establishment, but she seems to genuinely care about students. Through her work as VP academic and university affairs and a student senator-at-large, she has championed student interests by acquiring KN95 masks, extending the drop deadline for term two and pushing UBC to enact stronger vaccination and mask policies. But her personal attacks against a fellow exec during debates call into question her ability to play nice with execs — a trait that could hinder her ability to fulfill her many promises. Choi said it himself: “I am so unqualified.” While he said he will read up on AMS policies and rules if elected, the learning curve will be steep. Still, Choi’s heart is in the right place. His interest in fostering a community for students coming out of the pandemic is rooted in his personal experiences — he feels disconnected from campus after transferring from UBC Okanagan to online classes at UBC Vancouver last year. He is also arguably the most approachable and genuine of this year’s presidential candidates. The question is: how far does approachable get you? Of the newcomers, Harakal is the most qualified, but they still don’t have a good understanding of how the society functions. They performed well at the debates and would bring an important voice as a Queer, Indigenous person to an organization that has historically lacked this perspective. Their goals of creating more study spaces and social opportunities seem achievable, but their desire to oppose tuition increases by adding more students to the Board of Governors is unrealistic. Harakal has some good ideas and has potential to represent students well, but they would need to read up more on what an AMS president can actually do. Kaufman wants to remove all COVID-19 measures on campus, cut AMS frill expenses and make financial resources for BIPOC and low-income students more accessible as AMS president. Although Kaufman says he’ll advocate against COVID-19 restrictions like vaccination requirements for gyms, he might be overestimating the president’s role in lobbying the provincial government. His debate performance also showed that he’s not very familiar with the society’s policies. Kaufman is the VP of Students for Freedom of Expression (SFE , a student group heavily criticized for attempting to bring controversial speakers to campus, like far-right pundit Lauren Southern. He said he would resign from SFE if elected. The Pan is an inanimate object. It also doesn’t want to get elected. It’s funny — although it did call learning about the Equity Action Plan ahead of the election “unpaid labour” — and has some good ideas on creating a more spirited community. However, if students are upset at the current AMS administration for its lack of effectiveness, an AMS under The Pan would be worse. Again, it’s an inanimate object. Maybe students are so fed up with the AMS that they believe a cooking utensil is their only option. But if students want to see actual change, they should look outside the kitchen. The Pan’s human representative is Thomas McLeod,The Ubyssey sOpinion & Blog Editor. He is not involved in this year’s election coverage. Remy is literally a rodent. Although he has questionable hygiene – because he’s a rat – Remy has seemingly good platform points like climate justice, food security and student engagement. But, his performance during the debates has shown that he doesn’t know AMS policy well, potentially indicating that he wouldn’t be able to follow through on platform promises. Also, he can’t read. After being kicked out of Open Kitchen, Remy’s looking for a new home, but he might not be able to handle the heat in the kitchen if elected president. Shoaib is another highly-qualified candidate in this year’s presidential race. After serving as associate VP external and VP external, he can point to his successful campaigns to permanently end student loan interest and to set minimum standards within post-secondary sexual violence policies. But, as has been brought up often, he recently met with anindependent MPwhose previous sexual assault charge was highly publicized. Shoaib also knew about the charge ahead of time — but said he didn’t know the “extent” of it. He has apologized, but this controversy reflects an error in judgement that some students might not be able to easily forgive. First-year Arora seems excited to help students but doesn’t appear to have done much background research or have clear goals. In her interview, she was unfamiliar with open educational resources (OERs , something previous VP academics have focused on in their advocacy. While it’s expected that newcomers won’t have the knowledge that comes from in-depth experience in student government, Arora could have filled a lot of the gaps with a cursory look through the AMS and Senate websites. However, as the only international student running for VPAUA, Arora does provide a perspective that other candidates may not have. Kanji has a wealth of experience in the AMS and with the office of the VPAUA through his work on the Advocacy Committee. Kanji’s proposals and stances span much of the VPAUA portfolio and show an aspiration to deliver for students while being tempered by real-world experience. Fellow candidate Dana Turdy did make a solid point when she mentioned in the debates that he had no mention of sexual violence prevention in his platform. But if Kanji is able to achieve his goals with regards to OERs, lecture-capture technology and Black student support, he’ll be able to improve the lives of virtually every UBC student. Sandhu’s passion for making UBC students’ lives better is clear. As a two-time senator and the AMS sustainability coordinator, her resume is strong. However, her responses at the debates were often lacking in substance. The VPAUA needs to stand up for students in tense situations with top university admin and her debate performance didn’t make it clear she’d be able to do that. She does stand out as the only candidate to mention graduate student stipends in her platform and her focus on affordability and wellbeing could lead to real changes for UBC students. Overall, Sandhu is a passionate candidate with relevant experience, but might not be the most effective advocate for students. While many candidates promise to better engage students, Turdy is one of the few who has a solid plan: she wants to introduce formal consultation guidelines. Furthermore, Turdy came off well at the debates and she’d undoubtedly be just as quick on her feet when lobbying the university as VPAUA. But after keeping her hands clean for most of the two debates, she sprang some (mostly valid attacks on her fellow candidates near the end, denying them a chance to respond if she had criticized them earlier in debate. Still, Turdy is clearly passionate about making life better for UBC students and has plans to make it happen. Du has extensive experience with the VP admin portfolio from his time as associate VP. He also has specific plans for how he’ll achieve his platform which is focused on helping clubs return to pre-pandemic membership levels and activity, increasing transparency and improving communications with clubs and constituencies. But during the debates, Du showed a lack of knowledge on some specific policies that impact the portfolio, specifically I-17, the AMS’s Sexual Violence Policy. Du also expressed a blasé attitude to being uncontested, which is concerning given this is the second year in a row the VP admin race has been uncontested. As this year’s associate VP external, Cabangon already has some experience advocating for students at the highest levels of government. Through the campaign, he displayed knowledge about every aspect of the portfolio and was aware of his predecessor’s shortcomings. He brings some new ideas to the table, namely his focus on lobbying for climate action. Cabangon is certainly a qualified candidate, but may have overemphasized that fact. His focus on the inexperience of other candidates during the debates brings into question whether he would be interested in giving others the chance to gain the knowledge needed to succeed him. Co maximized her time in the VP external office, gaining lobbying and policy-drafting experience, despite officially being associate VP campaigns and community engagement commissioner. She showed a passion for helping other students and has specific ideas on how to do so on a broad range of issues. She is no AMS newcomer, and her platform is trying to move forward on accomplishments the office has made in years past. What sets Co apart is her experience working on campaigns and student engagement, both in and out of the AMS. With that, she seems best equipped to change the VP external’s reputation as being disconnected from students. Jain came into this race with a personal angle, wanting to respond to racially-charged hate crimes and international student issues. While being a newcomer to the AMS can help bring in innovative ideas, Jain brought general plans but not enough policy knowledge. Jain had difficulty articulating how he wants to accomplish his goals, often falling back on saying he would speak to as many students as possible to find out what their concerns are. He says he would give the position his all if elected, but the steep learning curve might make it difficult for him to be an effective advocate. Gill has many big ideas for the VP finance role, but those ideas may not be feasible. His promise to eliminate the AMS’s one-size-fits-all health and dental plan involves significant negotiation with the organization’s insurers, a task that would take longer than Gill’s term and would likely extend beyond the VP finance’s scope. Similarly, his promised participatory budgeting would extend the budget process significantly. Gill also lacks the financial background and knowledge of AMS systems and processes. He views the VP finance role as a learning experience, but he’ll need to learn quickly to keep afloat if elected. Having worked for a major financial firm in the past, Jassmann has experience in finance but seems to lack long-term vision. His pitch to increase mental health subsidies to $2,000 per student — while admirable — is likely unaffordable without a referendum to increase student fees. Jassmann has misunderstood the AMS’s relationship to the Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office — which is UBC-funded — on multiple occasions, and could not speak on the basics of the new financial system at the debates. Both these details demonstrate a lack of research, with Jassmann instead falling back on transparency and consultation talking points. Like Gill, Jassmann will need to read up if elected. Jin currently works within the VP finance office. As associate VP finance, she is clearly very familiar with the AMS’s financial systems. This experience makes Jin a qualified and prepared candidate for the VP finance role. However, this leaves her complicit in any financial issues faced over the past year. She also seems significantly less interested in transparency compared to her opponents. Jin is certainly the AMS establishment candidate and she seems confident that this fact will carry her to victory. Time will tell how this confidence, and potential lack of interest in student engagement, will affect her capacity to effect change. Incumbent Agosti-Moro is a passionate advocate for students. He has tangible goals centring around seeing through structural and systemic change in the Senate, implementing a permanent standing committee for equity, diversity and inclusion and the appeals committees’ processes. Out of all the candidates, he appears to be the most involved and knowledgeable on the administrative side of the Senate. During his time in the Senate, he co-chaired the Student Senate Caucus and chaired the Elections Committee. He’s also one of two Senate candidates only running for one position. His passion for structural change and his experience in leadership make him a strong candidate. Incumbent Bhangu is running for reelection as a student senator-at-large and has a good track record. Although her goals are ambitious, her time in the Senate proves her ability to deliver. One of her biggest successes was when she drafted and pushed for the drop date extension to February 6. Additionally, as the primary author of Senate 2023, she is well-versed in policy and emphasizes the importance of fighting for students in committee meetings, where student senators are a minority. All-in-all, Bhangu shows that students are at the forefront of her platform, and that she delivers on her promises. Bhangu is also running for AMS president. Hajizadeh is friendly and confident. She has done her research and has adequate knowledge of the Senate. Her experience is in the Arts Undergraduate Society and the AMS — she is currently an AMS councillor and the chair of the AMS Human Resources Committee. She’s also one of two Senate candidates only running for one position. She has a strong platform, but it might be too ambitious for how focused senators have to be to get anything done in a slow-moving body. Hajizadeh’s focus on transparency and student engagement is admirable, and she has experience in it — she organized AMS town hall on Instagram recently, albeit “town hall” is a loose term for the result. If elected, Hajizadeh will have to narrow her focus. Kanji has a lot to say and his drive clearly comes from a good place. He articulated his platform well during the debates, showing awareness of both pressing student concerns and the Senate’s previous policies. Kanji managed to ground his OERs and lecture capture promises in the administrative and technical steps needed to achieve them. As well, his goal of creating dedicated spaces for Black students shows he’s been paying attention to what the Black Caucus has been requesting. Also running for VP academic and university affairs, a seat on Senate would be useful if he wins. While his plans are ambitious, Kanji has done his research and can likely use his previous experience in governance to pull them off. Kaufman, a newcomer to UBC governance, is committed to advocating for “freedom” and representing the “genuine student voice,” though it’s unclear which students he’s referring to with this statement. His advocacy includes returning fully to in-person learning, holding in-person examinations and lifting COVID-19 measures. He did propose alternative accommodations for immunocompromised students, but displayed a lack of compassion toward concerned students, telling them to attend a different university if they don’t want to attend in-person classes. As a member of Senate, Kaufman also says he’ll fight for international students and those from conflict-ridden countries, but set out no specific plans to do so. Sandhu has two years of experience on Senate, which can be a huge asset as a senator-at-large. She’s approachable and said she has good relationships with other senators. Her platform, however, was based largely on ambiguously-phrased goals that most of the candidates also promised, such as increased student engagement and improved accessibility on campus. With the triennial review coming up, Sandhu wants to drive change within the Senate through rewriting committee terms of references and creating a code of conduct. However, she hasn’t been a prominent student advocate in the Senate in the past, raising the question of how she’s going to accomplish these lofty goals. Despite being a newcomer, Turdy is well-versed in Senate policy and has been paying close attention to past meetings. Her passion for advocacy will likely help her achieve her goals, even if she may have a difficult time doing everything she has set out to do within the body’s restrictive bureaucracy. She also lacked some specificity at times, particularly around her interest in creating a task force on accessibility. As she is running for AMS VP academic and university affairs, it would make sense for her to also be a member of the Senate where she would have more opportunities to advocate for student interests. Yee has an accessible platform focused on equity and Indigenous consultation that proposes some great ideas. Her push to include more voices from marginalized communities makes her a good bet to help create a standing Equity, Diversity and Inclusion committee. Yee has an agreeable personality that makes her likely to form connections and bonds easily, but she can have a difficult time getting to the point in her answers, making her a little unclear at times. As an incumbent senator, she has the advantage of understanding the Senate body, but it’s unclear what changes she’s personally effected since becoming a member. Holmes says this year would be his last if he is reelected to the Board. The sixth-year student is running for a fourth year on the Board after a lengthy stint in student governance. He has proven himself to be an effective advocate for students. Most recently, the university finally made progress on a Student Affordability Plan, something Holmes has championed for years. He also spoke in detail about his plans for advocacy for Campus Vision 2050 — something his competitors didn’t do. He has the relationships, the knowledge and the drive. While many may think Holmes has overstayed his welcome (and maybe he has! , he wouldn’t be a lame duck in his supposed last year in student governance. Students for Freedom of Expression vice-president Kaufman walks the line on most Board issues but often provides fewer specifics than someone who truly understands the policy. Kaufman is also running for AMS president, and if he wins, he would often be prevented from voting on any Board motions the student society was consulted on due to conflict of interest rules. This would mean there could be one less student vote on student-facing issues. Additionally, Kaufman’s focus on freedom of expression doesn’t necessarily align with the work the Board does, and could alienate him from governor allies and actual student interests. Yee is seeking a second year on the Board. She’s made her commitment to equity, climate action and transparency clear, and has strong community ties. However, it is a bit unclear what she’s accomplished on the Board over the last year. In interviews, she highlighted her work in bringing voices of disabled students to the Board, but in open Board meetings, Yee often doesn’t speak up or bring up specific concerns. However, Yee is a returning governor, so she would be able to get right back to work on the formation of a Disability Task Force, something that would benefit many. The Sexual Assault Support Centre’s (SASC usage has tripled in the time since its last referendum in 2019. SASC’s fee currently sits at $9.58, and the SASC team wants to bump it up to $16. This is a biggish ask — an increase of $6.42 — but we think that’s a small price to pay for such a valuable service. SASC has been asking for another increase for a while now, and this change would allow it to hire more staff to meet the growing demand students have for its service. SASC provides survivor support, hospital accompaniments, educational workshops and much more for free to UBC students and their family or friends. Even if you haven’t personally used SASC’s services, you probably know someone who has. Paying the price of a bubble tea is worth it to support survivors. This referendum is a whole swath of bylaw and constitution changes stuck into one question. Most of these are fairly straightforward and understandable — some of them are basic asks such as aligning the society’s bylaws with amendments to the Societies Act and updating the VP academic and university affairs’s responsibilities to match their real-life duties. But there are a few changes to flag: first, this referendum would allow the Finance Committee to pass budget amendments under $5,000 without Council approval, potentially lessening financial transparency. The society is also asking to add personnel “activities” to its bylaw on requesting records — meaning that any activities of staff deemed harmful to the society to release, such as a personnel investigation, cannot be requested. The president said this change is minor, and simply to ensure the society is protecting employee confidentiality, but it’s worth a deeper look into this one before you vote. This referendum includes fee reductions and an amendment to require digital opt-outs for all opt-outable fees. We support the fee reductions, given the large amounts currently in the funds. Voting on this referendum won’t save students a lot — if the referendum passes, students will only save a total of $3.37 — but every bit counts! On the digital opt-outs part of this referendum, we support it in principle because allowing people easier access to opt-out of fees is important, especially in a pandemic. But, we’re concerned the AMS didn’t properly consult with affected groups. When asked at a recent Council meeting whether the president has talked to those groups, President Cole Evans said he hadn’t. It’s also still unclear which groups will be impacted.The Ubysseycould be impacted, but we’re unsure due to a lack of communication from the AMS. If this referendum passes, we urge you to research the fee or service you’re opting out of. Many of them, includingThe Ubysseyif we are impacted, depend on these fees to function. The Bike Kitchen is a beloved community service. It’s been struggling financially for years, a challenge that has only been made worse by the pandemic. The bike shop is asking for a modest increase of $3.86, which would raise the tiny fee from $1.14 to $5. We think this is worth a ‘yes’ vote, as it would be a shame to see this valuable service disappear. The Bike Kitchen services bikes for an affordable price and has a community-based environment in which people can learn to fix bikes. It also gets a gold star on sustainability — what’s more sustainable than encouraging people to ride their bikes? However, if this passes, we urge the AMS to keep a closer eye on the shop’s finances going forward. The financial troubles stretch back a few years, and it’s important to ensure that going forward, the Bike Kitchen doesn’t return to the same dire financial situation it’s in right now.

(Courtesy of Tina Vo Many college-aged students have not put too much thought into what the Equal Rights Amendment is. A lot vaguely understand that it works to ensure gender equality in the United States constitution, but do not think about how it can affect universities and the legal rights of college students. TheEqual Rights Amendmentis a proposed amendment to the Constitution that guarantees equal legal rights for Americans regardless of sex. It is vital that college students and universities across the country recognize the significance and take steps to implement the ERA because it affects all genders and marginalized groups. On Jan. 27, Reps. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., and Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., presented HJ. Res. 28, a resolution to the House recognizing that the Equal Rights Amendment has met all legal conditions to be recognized as the 28th Amendment to the Constitution. “It is long past time to cement gender equality in our nation’s most important text, the Constitution, once and for all. With the ERA, we secure equality under the law for women and all marginalized genders,” stated CongresswomanMaloney. The inequality woman and marginalized genders face on a day-to-day basis cannot be tolerated, and both college students and the University of Arizona need to recognize that. RELATED:From classroom to courtroom We as students need to push ourselves and the University of Arizona to fight for the ERA’s guarantee of gender equality and stand up for anti-discrimination policies that could make the UA a more equitable place. Women and people of all genders are continuously facing a plethora of challenges due to a lack of legal protections — but the acknowledgment of equal rights in our constitution and on our campus should not be one of them. Shira Griffith, the state director of Generation Ratify California, a youth-led movement to ratify the ERA, states that colleges across the country should, “update the Title IX policies and other equity policies to reflect the ERA.” Not only should the UA and colleges across the country support the ERA, but they should also begin to take steps to ensure that the ERA is reflected and required in education. If the UA were to enforce and support the ERA, it would greatly alter and benefit students by changing how public institutions deal withTitle IXprocesses and regulations. Title IX prevents discrimination on the basis of sex within education, however there are many loopholes within Title IX that the ERA can close, benefiting the lives of women and marginalized genders across campus. If the UA and universities across the country choose to implement the ERA, “colleges will have to update their equity policies to reflect the much-needed changes in this country,” Griffith reaffirms. This can cause major changes that would ensure survivors receive just treatment, discriminatory practices and policies are eliminated and a clear judicial standard for every issue relating to discrimination based on sex is addressed. RELATED:OPINION: Has the Student Union gone overboard with their prices? Dianne Post, the head of the ERA Task Force in Arizona states that there is, “nothing wrong with a state school supporting a national constitutional amendment,” and that the impact of support from universities could put, “pressure on the legislature to get this done.” We need to urge the UA to apply the ERA to provide equal rights to all students on campus. If you are a student who wants to get involved, Post said that students can advocate through educating about the importance of the ERA, lobbying your own state legislators and using the ERA to argue when faced with discrimination. I insist that all students remain aware of this critical piece of legislation. It affects every single one of us. If we want to begin to care about equal and accessible education for all at the UA, we need to include in our discussions the importance and need for the ERA. We need to drive the UA to do what is right and that is reflect the ERA in all its policies and practices.

crimson_2022_79,"The fundamentals of public speaking and Expos 40 dictate that we should eliminate filler phrases from our speeches. Rather than filling silences with “like”s and “um”s, we should simply pause, collect our thoughts, and resume in anObamaesque manner. It’s emphatic, our teachers tell us. After making an important point, the silence carries the gravity of our words — whatever that means. But somehow, we always find ourselves saying, “like.” For many, the word “like” evokes images of “Valley Girl” — a movie most of our generation probably hasn’t even seen — and stereotypical teenage ditzes. For me, “like” invokes a memory of a conversation I had at Harvard with someone who said “like” six times in a row because they lost their train of thought. That’s not to say using filler phrases is a bad thing. The word “like” is a pleasant reminder of how we ditched the formality of unmuting and muting on Zoom and returned to in-person conversations. Listening to that person’s struggle to rack their brain for the thought that just wouldn’t resurface, I was reminded of countless memories of being in the same position. Contrary to what a debate coach might say, using filler phrases can actually be a good thing. Astudyfrom the University of Texas at Austin found that people who use filler phrases such as “like” and “you know” actually appear more thoughtful and deliberate. Filler phrases tend to appear more commonly among “women, younger participants, and more conscientious people,” who “use discourse markers, such as ‘I mean’ and ‘you know,’ to imply their desire to share or rephrase opinions to recipients.” Having devoted their full attention to the conversation at hand, they are thinking carefully about how to convey information in a nuanced manner. A natural consequence of these findings to me seems that using “totes my goats” is linked to being unpopular. The details aren’t important, but like, you get the gist. Such is the duality of filler phrases. They invoke images of “Valley Girl” and surfer bros, but also a sense of familiarity — a reminder that despite others’ world-class achievements, they’re just as human and prone to verbal tics as we are. Even at Harvard, with classmates who have sat in on Parliament meetings and performed in Carnegie Hall, we can’t stop ourselves from saying “like.” But beyond that, filler words serve a functional purpose. Discourse markers help us evaluate whether the people we converse with are invested in our conversations, as well as their personality types — infinitely helpful for the fretful Harvard freshman trying to “find their people” a week before the semester even starts. In fact, some studies have suggested that speech-lacking filler phrases cansoundtoo reserved, careful, or even unfriendly (that probably explains why your crush has never said “like” or “um” around you . When declining an invitation, saying “um, well, like, sorry” canappearmore polite than simply saying, “no” (a tip for when someone confesses their crush on you — not that it’ll ever happen . Filler words, in the right time and place, are comforting. Used in informal conversations, certain phrases, such as “like” and “you know what I mean,” can actuallydemonstrateattentiveness and help convey your ideas more clearly. Used in the middle of a presentation or interview, however, they can detract from your credibility and overall message; repeating “um” suggests that you’re unprepared even when you aren’t. To sum it up for the ruthlessly results-oriented Harvard students among us: use filler phrases when graded on participation; ditch them when graded on presentation. Filler words represent a microcosm of the dichotomy between formal and informal conversation, a dichotomy that shouldn’t exist. Removing them from our parlance doesn’t change who we are or the quality of our ideas; just because someone (i.e. that onesection kid speaks with formal language doesn’t mean they’re smarter or merit more attention. Instead, we should acknowledge that great ideas are great ideas, regardless of how they are communicated. Doing so necessitates realizing that we oftensubstitutemental shortcuts for more difficult problems, such as evaluating the quality of one’s ideas based on how one speaks. Increasing tolerance for filler words can rightfully shift our perception of professionalism. For now, though, I don’t recommend using “totes my goats” in your next interview. You’re a Harvard student, after all; you’ve got to speak to impress. Andrew P. Y. Zhao ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Grays Hall."
stanforddaily_2022_52,"Dear Maya, Just as I leave Stanford, you will be starting your journey. You have always made sure to blaze your own trails, but I am so excited that we will both be able to call this wonderful, complicated place home. And I know Stanford is excited about the better Martinez-Krams. The campus looks and feels so different now from when I first stepped onto campus as a student four years ago. There were no neighborhoods, masking guidelines or Barrillaga. My dorm, Freshman Sophomore College, no longer exists. When I was interviewed on a radio show before an Oregon State vs. Stanford baseball series, I could proudly say that The Stanford Daily was still a daily. I remember telling you that I joined The Daily and how I won the lottery. Bobby Pragada ’19 pulled my name out of a hat, randomly placing me in the press box next to King Jemison ’21 for a Stanford football game day. I asked King what to wear, what to bring and how to write about Stanford’s collapse against Utah, but the best advice I received that night came as we left the press conference and walked across the south end zone. “Do you want a picture?” King asked. “No, I’m okay,” I told him. “Are you sure?” “Well, I guess.” The picture was on my Instagram story a few hours later and still serves as my Twitter cover photo. I stopped to smell the roses, commemorating what became my first of three seasons covering football for The Daily. I appreciated the moment when I announced women’s soccer in North Carolina on KZSU 90.1 FM, as mommies texted me material to discuss during a 30-minute delay. I glowed when I interviewedTara VanDerveerfor the first time. I texted our family group chat in awe as soon as I finished my interview withJulie Foudy. I faltered as well. I watched from the right field press area at Sunken Diamond during the NCAA regional tournament and envisioned returning to the spot in a year. I wish I had paused that moment. The pandemic wiped out the entire tournament, and I was back home living with you. It is so easy to rush through college thinking of what is ahead. When taking out your pencil for a Monday morning lecture, it is easy to dream of a Friday afternoon nap. But if you rush through that week, you won’t enjoy the Stern burrito bowls on Tuesday, the friend with a nice smile in your Wednesday morning section or the sunset over Hoover Tower on Thursday. It took me a while to grasp this, especially in my writing. You can read back through my early stories and know everything that happened on the field or the court, and nothing that happened outside the lines. Eventually, though, I began to capture the people in the story. Cybele Zhang and Iwrote about the Stanford players on the U.S. women’s national team, and then you and I traveled to France andyour photographappeared in The Daily. I wrote about thepeople making noisein a fan-less Maples Pavilion. I asked players, coaches and media members about Tara VanDerveer’s1,098 wins. I told the story of the football teampracticing in the park. I foundmy voiceamid tragedy. I am so thankful for the many people who helped me outside The Daily. Nick Sako wrapped me with his parka when I was shivering from the postgame cold as I interviewed David Esquer ’87 in shorts and a short sleeve shirt. Janie McCauley and I shared desserts in empty arenas, as she shared tips about how to humanize my stories. Jacob Rayburn inspired me with his writing and understanding of an entire campus’s worth of athletics. As you know, I played club baseball at Stanford. Throughout my whole life, I wanted to end on a good swing whenever I practiced, and I would ask for “one more” until I got it. This year, I stopped asking for “one more.” I looked at the calendar and realized this was my final year playing baseball. Instead of relying on “one more” swing to fix my mistakes, I treated every day on the field as my last. Therefore, when I caught COVID and isolated while my team played in the regional tournament in Lancaster, I grieved having to follow along on GameChanger, but I knew that I made my last swing my best. You will never know when you will be doing something for the last time. You may go to TAP once a week until you spend your last dining dollars and never order another Pac-12 Burger. You will celebrate turning in your week 10 Math 51 problem set, knowing you will never take another math class. Once, I waved goodbye to sophomore year friends, not knowing the pandemic would delay our next hello by two years. I learned to appreciate every moment. I am so excited about yours.

wildcat_arizona_2022_47,"An image of an out-of-state voter using the absentee ballot system. As college students, we have the opportunity to participate in the electoral process and help steer the direction of politics. Younger generations have a unique opportunity to understand the political process due to outlets like social media, which aboutone in fiveAmericans use to access their political news, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study. Due to this level of access to political resources, young people have an extraordinary opportunity to learn about the political process and participate in elections. The officials we do or don’t vote for in this process make decisions that will affect us. They vote on topics like student debt, social rights, funding for higher education and the economy. Other decisions that politicians make today will also impact what kind of world we enter upon graduation, so casting a vote is our way to express and decide what we want for our lives and futures. Out-of-state students are in an even more unique position when it comes to elections, as they can decide which address they choose to register to vote under. However, out-of-state students should vote or continue to vote in their home state. The policies implemented at the local level will have the most impact on out-of-state students, even while they are away at college. Families, friends, the larger community and even the student can experience political tension from local politics, which can impact the student’s college career. As an out-of-state student from Tennessee, I see the need to continue voting in my home state while in Arizona. Tennessee is known for its predominantly Republican legislature and conservative values. Since these values don’t align with my own, the only way I can try and make a difference within my home state and see my own values reflected in the politics there is to vote in Tennessee. It gives me an opportunity to vote people into office who will make economic and educational decisions at the federal level that may impact my college career. Young voters are increasingly becoming a stronger presence in elections. Millennials and Generation Z had arecord-breaking turnoutin the 2020 election, foreshadowing great potential sway in elections to come. Despite these encouraging statistics and opportunities, young adults within these generations had thelowest voter turnout percentage (51.4% among all other age demographics in the 2020 election. Most of the low turnout likely stems from lifestyle and voter registration blocks, as many students and young adults struggle to make time to register to vote or make it to the polls, because of the unpredictability and instability of their schedules. This can be especially true for college students with loaded schedules. Therules aboutregistration deadlines, voter ID requirements and residency requirements, which can be complicated for out-of-state students, can impact new and young voter turnout as well. RELATED:OPINION: The Inflation Reduction Act is a big win, but we can still do more Older voters show up to vote in midterm elections about twice as much as younger voters, according toa journal published bythe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and Arizona State University. The gap continues to widen for local elections, proving that younger voters and students need to be more active in politics, particularly within their own local elections. However, this can be especially difficult for someone who is an out-of-state college student. Navigating one’s local and home state politics while away can seem overwhelming, as well as keeping up with registration deadlines and voting days. Despite this, there are many ways students can stay active within their home state. There are manyorganizations and resourcesavailable for students who want to register to vote. Around campus, many activists attempt to persuade people to register to vote as well. Out-of-state students can also participate in local elections and midterm elections throughabsentee ballots. If out-of-state students do not see themselves living in the state they are attending university for the long term, they should continue voting in their home state. Doing so can not only increase the younger voter turnout rate but can also ensure a student’s voice and values are heard within their permanent state of residence. This is how more diverse opinions and views can be seen in state governments and how youth can begin shaping the society they will enter while in college. As someone who has felt underrepresented and undervalued because of their views within their own state, and as someone who also had the opportunity to live elsewhere for college where this was not the case, I realize that voting is the only way to possibly change these circumstances for me and others that I care about in Tennessee. This is why it is essential to vote as a college student and not let residency constraints due to attending a college in a different state get in the way of this fundamental right.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_21,"Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this article did not contain thesourceto the authoritative retelling of Martha Nasch’s story of imprisonment and poetry writing. When you think of poetry, do you think of pretentiousness, political statements or pompous words? When was the last time you read poetry without it being a requirement for a class? Do these rhetorical questions perhaps remind you of a contemporary form of poetry? Martha Nasch, a housewife from St. Paul, Minn., wrote thesewordswhile confined to a psychiatric hospital in the 1920s: “ … I’m judged as a goof and a nut, And classed far less than a mule Behind thickened walls, where Satan now calls, I play the asylum fool.” For seven years, poetry served as Nasch’s escape from the hospital walls and window into the real world. Today, her granddaughter and great-granddaughter have compiled all of her poems in a book titled “Poems from the Asylum,” including an account where Nasch is restrained against her will. Nasch’s poetry is enough to remind us that words are truly the only legacy that can persist through the damage of space and time. The escape that her words provided her is now able to give her readers an insight into different worlds. If mere words can provide this vivid escapism, then why is poetrydying? Even though the general readership of poetry itself is on therise— according to the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA , the number of adults reading poetry between 2012 and 2017 grew by 76% — there is a sense of niche poetry culture thatisolatesthe general public from the art since a large part of its popularity is concentrated in younger generations that are looking at poetry in itscontemporaryforms. Poetry has power because of its ability to make large statements in the smallest amount of words. It can help express the ideas that many of us may not have the capacity to fully articulate. The simple schematic arrangement of words also has power in the comfort it provides to its readers. The power of poetry has toppledgovernmentswith its revolutionary ideas, and Amanda Gorman’s poetryperformanceduring President Joe Biden’s inauguration created a sense of togetherness after the long, tumultuous first weeks of 2021. For centuries, poetry has been an expression of love, regret, anger, celebration — even natural imagery is celebrated by the most lucid descriptions in rhyme. This medium can express anything and everything, but its decreasing mainstream popularity suggests that either the poets of the world are doing something wrong or that readers aren’t being exposed to the variety of works in the world. As searches for poetry become morecyclical, students searching for resources for their coursework are often the ones taking an interest in looking for poetic works rather than individuals who wouldindependentlyread poems. This general hesitation towards poetry can be attributed to the way that it is taught in schools. Most language class curriculums focus on poetic devices, techniques and other linguistic complexities behind creating different types of poems. Students are taught about sonnets, villanelles, found poems, haikus, meters, ballads and more. For example, students learning sonnets written in older English focus on the rhyme schemes, syllables, meter and devices used in the poem instead of how and why the author used certain words to respond to certain occurrences. As haikus become defined by 17 syllables and found poems become methodical searches for complex words, students end up tediously categorizing works of literature. They then may end up developing a sense ofresentmenttoward poetry and later associate it with analytical work and time consumption instead of the escapism and relatability that poetry stands to offer. By focusing on the rhetorical aspects of poetry, the original emotional impact intended by the authors is often lost. UCI professor Rebecca Schultz, who teaches English 16: The Craft of Poetry, expresses similar sentiments regarding her approach to teaching poetry. She focuses on trying to help her students “experience the poem,” and even ensures that the experience is fun by choosing poems that feel “alive,” comparing Shakespeare’s sonnets to contemporary sonnets about bar hopping. Calling it “Shakespeare trauma,” or the fear of studying older and complex poetry because of the difficulty it presents to students in high school, she acknowledges students’ various past experiences with the study of poetry. As a result, Schultz makes sure to stray away from the analysis of specific literary devices so as not to trigger past fears of rote, or memorization-based learning, and students can instead focus on immersing themselves into the author’s perspective. Schultz’s approach chooses to help students understand how poems are rooted in the world and universal experiences. In looking at how a decreasing number of people take a vested interest in poetry, Schultz also expressed concerns regarding the Common Core curriculum taught in American schools from kindergarten to 12th grade. She argues that there is an unseen pressure on teachers to emphasize teaching for tests that take students away from learning the power of poetry and understanding the inherent desire to respond to worldly issues with language. Instead, students’ curriculum often replaces the immersive, sensory experience of literature with robotic memorization of poetic devices. With her experience in working in publishing, Schultz also mentioned that the promotion and publication of newer poets tend to be much more market-focused. Since stories tend to be “easier to enter,” poetry often cannot provide the same form of entertainment that is expected of prose found in books and narratives. The lack of access to classic poetry with the shift in the education system has also led to a decrease in enthusiasm for the attention to language that poetry itself demands. Since poetry does not always target a specific age group or demographic, the newer forms that seem to attract readers are those that focus on relatability for all reading groups. According to Schultz, creating a “real” poem means “using language to capture an experience that communicates specificity to the reader — something true but unsayable.” The social aspect of poetry has been decreasing in popularity as well. With the rise of “BookTok” and “BookTube,” communities on TikTok and YouTube platforms dedicated to literary discussions, contemporary writers have been gaining immense recognition, encouraging younger generations to become more interested in the different genres of fiction. The lack of analysis and interpretation necessary to understand prose helps move it forward in the literary race, while poetry gets left behind. As fiction and its genre companions, like self-help and essay collections, gain constant promotion, poetry tends to be viewed as a difficult form of work. Poetry is often considered unappealing to the general reading population, with only poetic collections published by celebrities tending to gainspacefor review and critique. Even though the seemingly decreasing interest in poetry may imply that it is an acquired taste, this couldn’t be farther from the truth. The beauty of poetry originates from the fact that it doesn’t need to be understood. It leaves spaces open for interpretation and application to our own selves. When Joy Harjo, the current National Poet Laureate,wrote: “Everybody has a heartache — This silence in the noise of the terminal is a mountain of bison skulls. Nobody knows, nobody sees— ” Harjo doesn’t just tell her own story; she tells a universal story of stifling loneliness in crowds. Every poet may just be writing how they feel, but in doing so, they are expressing how the world feels too. Reading more poetry doesn’t exist because it seems fancy to quote obscure writers in everyday conversations; it exists because it allows us to find relatability. And in moments of confusion, everyone can find somewordsto hang onto: “ … To those I one time knew On Earth, wide and blue, I’ll send them my thoughts in a poem.” Nandini Sharma is an Opinion Staff Writer.

crimson_2022_96,"A few days into my first semester, I found myself herded into a group of prospective students, wide-eyed tourists, and other bored undergraduates wandering about Harvard Yard. One heel back, then the next: The tour guide had absolutely nailed the infamous backwards stride. Suddenly, we were stopped at a set of foreboding steps and met with an anecdote about valuable books, an unsinkable ship, and a rich mom who survived and honored a son lost at sea. Thestoryof the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library is undoubtedly an interesting one. The library itself? Beautiful, although intimidating at first. The reading rooms are eerily quiet, and during my earliest study sessions at Widener, the thought of dropping so much as a pencil — let alone a Hydro Flask — was horrifying. Once I got over that mildly irrational fear, the long stretch of shelves and tables that is the Loker Reading Room became one of my favorite spots. Recently, as I’ve found my gaze drifting from dense readings to the stunning craftsmanship on the ceilings and along the walls, I’ve begun to consider something else: What did this space look like 60 or 70 years ago? Surely not like it does today — well, not exactly. This library may have been built by a woman, but it certainly wasn’t built for women. As the classic tour tale goes, when book collector and Harvard alum Harry Elkins Widener ’1907 died on the Titanic, his mother Eleanor Elkins Widener — who escaped the tragedy on a lifeboat – sought to build a library in his memory. In 1915, after three years of planning and construction, the library opened to the Harvard student body. Though female students from Radcliffe College — the all-female counterpart to an all-male Harvard — were occasionally permitted to use Widener, they wereonly allowedin a “small cell” in the upper level of the building. In June of 1946, women at Radcliffe who were enrolled in summer classes wereawardedfull library privileges akin to those held by Harvard men, but only for that term. It was also around this time that Harvard’s classes officially became co-ed, although the mix of students did not extend far beyond the classroom. When Lamont Library was founded in 1949, Radcliffe women were fully excluded from the premises, a move which was later justified as a measure to prevent “undermining ‘male emotional stability.’” It was at this point that female undergraduate students were officially allowed to use the main reading room in Widener, but they could not sit down and had to exit the building by six o’clock. There were also specifications about where women could walk so that they would not distract the studious men. The precise timeline of the full integration of women into the male-dominated Harvard way of life is slightly ambiguous, but by the late 1970s, with the “non-merger merger” of Radcliffe and Harvard, women were allowed to use most of the formerly male-only facilities. More than 20 years later, in 1999, the two institutions officially merged. This university has a deep and complicatedhistorywith women, and this brief transcription hardly scratches the surface. However, one thing is clear: Women have only been widely considered more thanmaidsand distractions for less than a quarter of Harvard’s nearly four centuries of existence. For most of Widener’s history, the trek up the marble steps was not daunting for undergraduate women because they were afraid of dropping pencils inside the reading room. The stairs were unwelcoming in the truest sense of the word. Today, although I am able to fully take advantage of the library, I am also forced to confront the truth that this space wasn t meant for me. Harvard was not founded with the intention to educate women — especially not women of color, trans women, queer women, disabled women, or poor women. Even Radcliffe and the other Seven Sister colleges initially catered towards primarily wealthy and elite white women. Sexism is still ever-present in academia, and anyone who is not a cisgender white man is subject to systematic discrimation in some form: lower pay, lack of representation in higher positions, much higher rates of sexual assault, and minimal recognition for their work. Institutions like Harvard continue to perpetuate harmful and exclusionary environments byprotecting menwho take advantage of power dynamics until student outrage forces them to act. Nonetheless, through the efforts of women like Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, who founded what is now known as Radcliffe College; Florynce R. Kennedy, who organized a “pee-in” to protest the lack of women’s bathrooms at Harvard; and The Radcliffe Union of Students, who pushed for the development of both a Women’s Center and the Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies department, there has been significant advancement in gender equality on campus. Today, Harvard is marked by a diverse student body, flourishing gender-inclusive organizations, an increased amount of tenured female faculty, and constant engagement inimportant conversations. Progress still needs to be made, but as I stare at the intricate molding that lines Widener Library, I find comfort in knowing that the white men for whom it was built would be very angry that I sit here regularly and continue to make noise — metaphorically, of course, as long as I’m in the reading room.

stanforddaily_2022_122,"—Monte Fischer is a Ph.D. student at Stanford In case you haven’t heard, Stanfordmandatedthat students must get boosted by Jan. 31 — or else. When Paul Offit — director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, decades-long enemy of the anti-vax movement and co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine — tells his own twenty-something sonnot to get boosted, you might start to ask some questions about the wisdom of Stanford’s latest mandate. It is becoming clear: Mandating boosters is an affront against the medical and bodily autonomy of Stanford students. That is why I starteda petition to Stanford leadershipto rescind the booster mandate. I will lay out my case here, but I encourage everyone to read the petition itself and draw their own conclusions. If you agree that getting boosted should be a personal decision,let Stanford know. To start with, our campus is already extremely well-protected against covid. We areover 95%fully vaccinated. Our student body is overwhelmingly young. The latest CDC weekly COVID-19 hospitalization rate estimate for 18-49 year old, fully vaccinated people is9 in 1,000,000. If you’re under 30, that’s a weekly rate of4.5 in 1,000,000. This is on par with the pre-pandemic rates of hospitalization from the flu for18-30 year olds, but Stanford (rightly didn’t mandate flu vaccines back then. It is a farce to pretend that booster vaccines will save us from the spread of COVID-19 on campus.The CDC itselfdoes not claim this.Even Dr. Fauciis now saying that Omicron will reach “just about everyone” and that, speaking of the vaccinated and boosted, “some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected.” Or take it from FDA acting commissionerJanet Woodcock: “most people are going to get Covid.” Take it from exploding case rates on campus and across the world:vaccines aren’t stopping the spread. Many people have justified and compassionate concerns about overwhelming the hospital system with COVID patients. But let us not kid ourselves by thinking that mandating boosters for Stanford students will prevent this. Besides being ineffective against Omicron transmission, COVID vaccines are not risk-free. In particular, young men aged 16–29 experience vaccination-induced myocarditis (heart inflammation at a rate of10.69 in 100,000. Our understanding of booster vaccine effectiveness itself is still preliminary, with a recent UK Health Security Agency report suggesting that 10 weeks after boosting, vaccine effectiveness had fallen toaround 45%.We are in a situation with preliminary data and uncertainty about long-term outcomes. This should have prompted caution and humility from University leadership. Instead, we got a mandate. Despite the risks, there are also good reasons to get boosted, especially if you are old or have preexisting conditions that put you at greater risk from COVID. By all means, let us make boosters available and easy to get! But by mandating,Stanford is paternalistically making our own medical choices for us. Note that we have received no argument for whythe sudden need to get every student boosted outweighs our rights to choose medical treatments for ourselves! There are good medical reasons to eat healthy meals, take up jogging or abstain from drinking alcohol (for those of age . But we would rightly be outraged if Stanford forced these decisions on us. That would be an unethical infringement on our basic rights of privacy and bodily autonomy. If you believe that boosting should be a personal, uncoerced medical decision,let Stanford leadership know. Our silence is interpreted as support, so let’s stop being silent. Everyone, boosted or not, has a common cause in this. We must stand for our right to our own bodies. We must not quietly submit to this performative and offensive mandate. Let us send a message to the University:treat us as adults.If Stanford thinks we should be boosted, let it persuade us with evidence and reason instead of holding our futures hostage and bullying us into compliance.

Stanford’s inadequate response only exacerbated this betrayal. We were incredibly disheartened by Stanford’s institutional reaction. There was no public statement, only a vague email signed by the Dean of the Medical School and the Executive Director of Vaden Health Services on June 24 stating that “this is a controversial issue.” Blandly pointing out that there is a “controversy,” while technically accurate, is a woefully lacking response to such a calamitous setback. As an academic institution with considerable privilege and voice, we are responsible for speaking out against injustice and not catering to both sides. As women at Stanford, we were shocked and frustrated to receive an email with no clear stance supporting the right of all people to bodily autonomy. Although a semi-apologeticresponseto the first communication was later sent out to the Stanford Medicine community, it was not sent to the entire university, and we did not receive it in the School of Engineering. We expected more from Stanford’s leadership, especially since this Supreme Court decision was leaked in May (at which timeStanford Law Professor Bernadette Meyler expressed concernsthat the leaked decision would substantially set back gender equity in our country . That should have provided ample time for University administration for University administration to plan a stronger response to such a monumental injustice. In an email sent announcing Stanford’sRally for Reproductive Rights, Senior Associate Dean for Global Health Michele Barry warned, “this decision will deepen inequities, jeopardize access to safe healthcare, and cost lives.” The shifting legal framework is already forcing doctors to leave “people waiting until death’s door before treatment is given” in order to avoid legal repercussions, asKate Shaw, Director of Gynecology at Stanford Health Care, explained at the rally on June 27. Moreover, Stephanie Melchor, an OB/GYN resident, drove home the sobering reality that this regressive decision disproportionately impacts marginalized communities. The Supreme Court ruling highlights the lack of diverse gender representation across our government’s highest offices. Five of the six individuals on the Supreme Court who signed the majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson are anatomically exempt from the consequences of their decision. The same lack of representation extends throughout our other branches of government, institutions, companies, and Stanford.As of 2020, only 19% of the faculty in the School of Engineering are women. In the School of Medicine, only 33% of the faculty are women. The representation of racial and other gender marginalized groups is even lower. This lack of representation is an issue in academia beyond Stanford, with concerns now being raised that the fall of Roe couldhalt or reverse progressin including more women in academia. Why has Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne, who hasworked extensively in the medical industry, not made any statement about this monumental stripping away of Americans’ fundamental rights? Previously, our President and Provost issued ajoint statementin honor of International Women’s Day: “We will continue the vital work of making our university more fully inclusive and supportive of all women.” If Stanford leadership wants to say they support women, they need to demonstrate it when our fundamental human rights are under attack. Rather than assurances about how Stanford will “abide by California state laws,” we want Stanford leadership to drive a call to action across universities, similar to howCalifornia has led the countryat the state level in protecting a woman’s right to choose. We call on Stanford leadership to clearly and publicly affirm that abortion access is an internationally established human right asdefined by the United Nations, and that the impacts of repealing Roe v. Wade are catastrophic for women and other people seeking reproductive healthcare. We call on Stanford to take direct action and issue a much stronger, university-wide statement supportingreproductive justice, in line with previous promises to women and marginalized communities. This statement should come from Stanford’s President and Provost, and should be sent to the entire Stanford community and posted publicly on Stanford’s website. University presidents at peer institutions (such as theUniversity of MichiganandUC Berkeley have taken much stronger public stands. We also call on Stanford leadership to take direct action and transparently inform the community about ongoing actions to improve gender equity across campus. Tell us what initiatives are ongoing to address the lack of representation of women and gender marginalized people in Stanford’s faculty. Amplify the voices of women law professors at Stanford such asJane SchacterandMichelle Mello. Highlight and support innovative research related to reproductive healthcare from the School of Medicine and beyond. For example, the Doerr School of Sustainability, which will open on Sept. 1, can connect and fund research related to theintersection of reproductive justice and environmental justice. Without the recognition that the Supreme Court overturning of Roe has life-threatening impacts on women and those seeking abortion-related healthcare, any response falls short. There is evidence that lack of access to legal abortions results inincreased rates of domestic violence, and yet women in Missouri arenot allowed to get a divorce while pregnant. Any legal decisions upholding or reverting toward a more patriarchal society have incredibly harmful impacts on people of all genders, with harms disproportionately falling on marginalized and exploited communities. In Stanford’s2021 IDEAL DEI survey, 46% of trans people, 40% of gender non-binary people, and 21% of women experienced harassing behaviors, a significantly elevated proportion relative to men (15% . Recently TheStanford Daily reportedthat professor Vincent Barletta, who still remains a tenured faculty member at the University, was the subject of three Title IX cases that found that Barletta had harassed one of his students. This situation is just one part of an ongoinghistory of sexual violenceon campus. These statistics and stories highlight Stanford’s struggles to create an equitable environment, which directly relates to the underrepresentation of marginalized genders in positions of power and also helps explain the insensitivity and inadequacy of Stanford’s institutional responses. Our disappointment in Stanford’s lack of a public stance is no doubt amplified by the amount of energy we and other marginalized students, faculty, and staff have personally invested in making Stanford live up to its ideals. As women in academia, we have witnessed firsthand how women and other marginalized groups (inacademiaandbeyond bear the brunt of unpaid labor, including in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI efforts. This is routinely frustrating and tiring, but becomes downright infuriating when Stanford’s leaders miss the mark as badly as they did on June 24th. At the same time, we are continually inspired by women leaders in Stanford Medicine who provide and advocate for this essential reproductive care, and others throughout the University who strive to improve DEI, despite institutional hurdles. As Shaw put it: “At Stanford, let’s be leaders and advocates in ensuring comprehensive, safe, and legal access to abortion and that all essential healthcare can be decided by an individual and their doctor.” We remain hopeful that Stanford’s leadership will take this opportunity to listen to, learn from, and amplify the voices of our very own experts on reproductive healthcare and realize that neutrality only ever supports the oppressor.

crimson_2022_80,"Two years ago, I heard the metallic clink of tiny coffee spoons against porcelain reverberate through a cafe in downtown Florence; the espresso machine, operated with fast, frantic precision, filled the looming frescoed ceilings with high pitched squeals. I fidgeted with two euro coins in hand as I stood in a crooked line, bothered by the inconsiderately animated conversations around me, the elderly people squinting their eyes haltingly to discern the glossy glass dessert case contents, and the wonderstruck tourists who took up too much of the limited space. As usual, the jokes and small talk exchanged between cafe patron and cashier held up the line and made the transaction most inefficient. But having grown up partly in Florence, coffee is a religious affair, and ever since I can remember, this crowded cafe has remained one of my family and friends’ favorite gathering places. So as always, I waited. I can be impatient, though. I can recall too many times that I hurried through the ritual to rush into the pristine emptiness of the piazza, to break from the noisy bustle — even though it was this wonderful chaos I would come to miss the most. A few waves of pandemic out, I regret my irreverence. I should’ve listened closer to the coffee spoon clinks calling strangers, friends, and family to gather. Treating these endangered moments of connectedness and noise and chaos as a duty rather than a privilege, I squandered the tiniest, most wonderfully insignificant moments. I feel this sensibility more than ever now, as I’ve witnessed cafes in post-pandemic Florence grow quieter. The welcoming clinks no longer ring out from open doors and street corners, but rather echo occasionally from behind thick, beige-walled apartment buildings. Ever since the lockdown started last year, the clinks have mostly been replaced with the muted shuffle of paper takeaway cups. These antiseptic units usher customers in and out of the cafe quickly. They make coffee appear most unnatural in the hand of an Italian — someone who has internalized devotion to the sanctity of a singular moment of pause that can come in a porcelain cup. One year ago, I visited the cafe for one last time before a complete lockdown, before it would close indefinitely for the first time since World War II. This time, with no line, I proceeded all too quickly. Soft jazz music, ordinarily drowned out by voices, played overhead — a sound too cinematically and uncomfortably fitting. I could see the glistening marble countertops too clearly — the same ones usually covered by leaning arms and gesturing coat sleeves. The bottles of liquor at the bar were arranged too neatly. Like the emptiness of Piazza Duomo or the perfect stillness of Piazza della Signoria, everything was too quietly flawless and statically beautiful. The coffee tasted better when we sipped rubbing elbows with strangers, overhearing snippets of the lives we would probably never come to know. I felt the loss of the old coffee ritual so deeply because chaos colors the lives we live. The tangential moments we share and the small unimportant things matter. And in the face of big, uncontrollable things, they matter even more. Months later, I visited Harvard hoping that being physically on campus might somehow fill the college-shaped void in me. But without shouts across the Yard, or the shuffle between lectures in Sanders, or even the whirring threat of nearly getting run over by a scooter, the millions of tiny red bricks and the still gaze of John Harvard offered little solace. This year, returning to life on campus finally hushed that silence. Off Zoom, it’s easy to appreciate the tangibles that make Harvard a special place: the resources, the academics, the beautiful Houses we inhabit. But what makes it truly alive are the moments we bring into its spaces. It’s the way we live in them. The way our conversations flow from common rooms to dining halls or the debates that keep us up too late at night. It’s the sound of us and all our passions, the continuous Cambridge traffic background noise included. While distanced from Harvard, I found that, oddly, I was as nostalgic for the good, serendipitous moments as the messy, even distressing ones I encountered while on campus. The good and the bad of chaos, inextricably intertwined, cannot exist one without the other. But in the silence, it felt like neither. And as the pandemic waxes and wanes, the sounds come and go — but when I do hear them now, I listen a little more closely, maybe just a little more patiently, too. Each sound is a heartbeat, and when they become more frequent, they create a pulse. Or maybe each sound is the ticking of a clock. Things change around us, but the clock keeps on ticking, time keeps passing, and for better or for worse, everything keeps on going. It is at once unnerving and comforting to realize these moments are all we really have. And if that’s the case, then we should appreciate them all the more — for all their color, chaos, and wonderful insignificance. Serena G.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_37,"The Supreme Court recentlyagreedto hear challenges to affirmative action policies practiced by colleges like Harvard and the University of North Carolina (UNC . The group that brought the case to the court,Students for Fair Admissions(SFFA , claims that evaluating college applications based on race — the basis of affirmative action — is discrimination, specifically mentioningallegeddiscrimination against Asian Americans by Havard and UNC, and white students applying to UNC. With these criticisms revitalizing during a time where the court leans towards aconservativemajority, it seems that affirmative action policies in college admissions may soon reach their end. The end of affirmative action policies could jeopardize the potential for an equal playing field for minority students living in marginalized communities, ultimately reiterating the economic, educational and racial disparity that the United States is known for. A ban on such policies would only supplement the ongoing racial inequity problems that the U.S. has long sought to fix. In the long, controversial history of inequity in America, there have been many attempts at achieving equity in education before affirmative action came to be. Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs , for example, were created to give black youths the opportunity to receive quality and equal education that schools and universities at the time did not want to give them solely because of the color of their skin. They are an example of what racism in the educational system resulted in, eventually leading to practices such as affirmative action, which benefit, not harm, students. So why is SFFA claiming that schools like UNC actively discriminate against white students? It seems that they completely forget the fact that decades ago, it was white southerners such as SenatorHarry Byrd, not minorities, that were discriminating against minorities in opposition to the integration of schools allowed byBrown v. Board. Although there is some truth that schools such as Havard and UNC discriminate against Asian-Americans and make it harder for them to be selected for admission by engaging in racial stereotypes that describe them as“book smart and one-dimensional,”their college enrollment rates remain the highest of any racial or ethnic group in the country, reaching 62% in 2019accordingto the U.S. Department of Education. Astudyconducted by Howard University student Whitney Wright analyzes the disparity between education in suburban and urban areas in the U.S., stating that education between these two sectors are “… drastically different due to resources, teacher attrition rate and lack of parental support with Funds being allocated to the top performing schools, leaving many low performing schools at a plateau to produce mediocrity.” With a clear discrepancy between these two sectors, it is hard not to think about the students that are overworking themselves in order to be on the same playing field as their affluent counterparts. Where educational and economic disparities lower their chances of success, they are likely participating in more extracurricular activities and enrolling in any Advanced Placement (AP classes that are provided at their school. It seems unfair that these students have to maneuver around various educational and economic setbacks in order for them to be an ideal candidate for a prestigious university while affluent students — who have little to no disparities — do not have to endure that many obstacles. Along withurban schoolsenrolling more diverse students from other ethnic and racial backgrounds, and 27% Hispanic and 15% Black studentenrollmentcomprising public schools, it seems understandable that affirmative action should be kept due to the various racial, economic and educational disparities these minority groups may face compared to affluent, majority students. However, if some people are not swayed that eliminating affirmative action may do more harm than good, at least take into consideration that some universities such as Havard are accepting students based onlegacy admissions, illegal bribery or bywealthy parentsdonating money in exchange for their kid’s admission into schools. These forms of legal and illegal bribery are much more detrimental than affirmative action since these spots may go to applicants that are not well-qualified for that school’s academic rigor. Scandals such as actressLori Loughlinpaying half a million dollars in bribes in order for her two daughters to go to USC and Hip-Hop legendDr. Dre’sdaughter being accepted into USC after his $70 million dollar donation in 2013 are examples where money is exchanged for college admissions instead of their kids’ academic achievements. The end of affirmative action would be another disparity among minorities trying to have equal footing with their counterparts. With the ongoing racial, economic and educational disparities these groups encounter, it is necessary that affirmative action policies in colleges that practice them continue in order for the disadvantaged to receive opportunities that otherwise would not have been given to them.

wildcat_arizona_2022_51,"Environmentalists gather to protest climate change in El Presidio Park in downtown Tucson, Az., on Friday, Sept. 20, 2019. Protesting can be an impactful way of changing climate legislation. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act, despite a misleading title, is a groundbreaking piece of legislation that is a step in the right direction for the climate fight in the United States. The act stems from President Joe Biden’sBuild Back Better Planthat was introduced at the start of his presidency. Originally proposed last year, the bill was thought to be too expensive by moderate Senators Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., leading to a pause in the process in the Senate. After months of meetings between senators, the bill finally passed as a scaled-down version onAug.12. However, the law, while a great step forward in climate legislation, is not enough. Students should be demanding more climate legislation going forward, especially since the midterm elections will take place soon. Certain successes of the law include establishing fair labor protections, as it creates good-paying, clean energy union jobs across the country. These jobs will help reduce emissions throughout different sectors of the economy and expand tax andbonus creditsto businesses that pay high wages for these registered apprentices. With talks of an upcoming recession, students should pay attention to this aspect of the law, as it could help some secure higher-wage jobs with labor protections upon graduation in the future. This could provide meaningful opportunities and careers for graduates in the upcoming years. Tax credits also apply to corporations that support clean energy in their supply chains. Other parts of the law include raisingcorporate taxesto 15%, eliminating tax loopholes for the wealthy, lowering the cost of prescription drug prices and incentivizing lower and middle-class Americans to make clean energy upgrades in their homes withtax breaks. Overall, the bill is a giant leap forward for climate policy in the United States, but there is more that could be done. Despite the Inflation Reduction Act’s climate progress, it did also give wins to oil and gas companies. Manchin, a Moderate Democrat who is usually the carrying vote for Democrats in the tied Senate, provided wins for oil companies as well in order to secure his vote on the act. He released some energyprovisionshe would like to see happen, one including the completion of theMountain Valley Pipeline. The Mountain Valley Pipeline is a gas pipeline that runs through Manchin’s state of West Virginia, as well as through some of Southwest Virginia. This provision would not only be a win for oil and gas companies, but it would interfere with current climate objectives and have steep environmental impacts in theAppalachian region. The pipeline requires the use and clearance of forests. There are numerous reasons that deforestation is bad for the planet, but the main one is that trees absorb and store carbon dioxide. If forests are cleared or disturbed, theyrelease carbon dioxideand other greenhouse gases. Releasing more greenhouse gases would make parts of the Inflation Reduction Act seem redundant, which is why we must continue to demand that our elected officials put climate first. RELATED:Climate change advocate Defend Our Future making push at the UA About83 acresof the Jefferson National Forest will be used during the construction phase of the pipeline, and about 42 acres during the operational phase. It also affects wildlife and will displace many animals, some which are of threatened and endangered species. The pipeline covers areas with high susceptibility tolandslides, which could damage certain homes near the area. The construction process of the pipeline has also faced certain issues with permits for waterway crossings, causing some of its progress to be halted for two years. These issues prove that, while the Inflation Reduction Act is going to do fantastic things, it still isn’t enough protection for the climate and we need something else. Politicians continue to take advantage of the democratic process by making decisions that benefit companies, not Americans or the climate. There are many things students and other young people can do to start making change. Staying informed on political events and laws like this one is the first step. Continuing to learn about the climate and understanding what is being done to keep the Earth clean is the best way to then spread the word to others, protest, join organizations and vote for politicians that will protect the climate. This law shows why it is important for students to care about climate change and legislation regarding green energy. It not only has many aspects that apply to young people’s futures, but it has also shown us that we need to continue being active in politics if we want to see more aggressive climate action from the government in the future. If a collective group can come together and understand why this is important, then climate progress can be made, and we can end the war against our planet that corporations and politicians create.

stanforddaily_2022_13,"The “Women in STEM” movement is regarded as inherently good, promising to close both a “confidence gap” and a pay gap. Particular attention is drawn to the opportunity for employment in the“fastest-growing and highest-paid jobs of the future.”Increasing the number of women in the STEM workforce has the added benefit of increasing the STEM workforce overall: No one, to my knowledge, is suggesting we close the gender imbalance by getting rid of any of the men. This happy accident should give us pause: Is Women in STEM really about empowerment? History gives us examples — Rosie the Riveter, The Space Race — in which people, particularly women, were encouraged to join particular fields. Looking back, we know now that these movements were not about empowering people, but rather using them in service of the short-term interests of industry. Will history judge the current race to push women into STEM the same way? Rosie the Riveter and the “We Can Do It” poster was part of a broader campaign launched by government and private companies to recruit and retain female workers during World War II. Bilge Yesil, Associate Professor of Media Culture at City University of New York, writes that“wartime propaganda idealized the image of the war worker woman and portrayed her as the strong, competent, courageous ‘unsung heroine of the home front.’”Historians James Kimble and Lester Olsen argue that the feminist, rather than pragmatic, interpretation of the “We Can Do It!” poster is an imposition of the present upon history: the original poster was“far from the feminist icon it has retroactively become.”In an article forThe Atlantic, writer Lane Wallace unpacks “The Complex Legacy of Rosie the Riveter,” writing that“as soon as it didn’t suit their purposes anymore, the same people who told women they could do it … told them they couldn’t do it anymore.”The employment-oriented view of empowerment shared by the two movements should give us pause as to the feminist motivations of the “Women in STEM” movement and who its narrative of empowerment ultimately serves. The influence of The Space Race on American education is also relevant, as an example of the way in which national interests influence students’ educational trajectories. After the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I in October 1957,the U.S. federal government used National Science Foundation funds to overhaul public school curricula in science and math fields, with the goal of training scientists who would help the nation reach the moon before the USSR.Technological innovation now plays this role. Big Tech companies not onlyencourage lawmakers to support STEM educationbut also“donate”to the causethemselves.This use of private funds to influence public education is cause for concernand should also, once again, lead us to question the beneficiaries of the “Woman in STEM” sub-movement of the broader STEM push. Meanwhile, American literacy isn’t doing too well,with 54% of Americans reading below sixth-grade level. In fact, California has the poorest literacy of any state. In the face of this problem,the shift away from the humanities in higher education seems a frivolous concern. The tension between STEM at the expense of the humanities is not about being able to appreciate Jane Austen or ponder Sartre. On a more fundamental level,reading is required to be able to gain knowledge, to follow complex arguments, to expand our horizons and to change our minds. It is crucial to the functioning of democracy. We could use non-technological ways of thinking to see that any problem has multiple solutions. There are two ways to even the gender imbalance in STEM: Instead of solely encouraging women into STEM, we could also encourage more men to study the humanities. Similarly, we could envision non-technological solutions to problems created by technology. We could address misinformation and fake news not solely through algorithms but alsoby allocating resources to education to make people better readers and critical thinkers. My point here is not that the solution is either/or. My point is that there are always multiple solutions to any problem and that we should always be skeptical when a solution is presented as self-evident — especially when it happens to benefit the powers-that-be. At Stanford, everyone is so focused on how to wield their immense privilege that they forget that they can also be a tool. I used to believe the “sell-outs” were evil masterminds. Now they seem more like pawns. Everyone — gender aside — I invite you to take a class in the humanities. You might like it. You might feel empowered by it. You needn’t major in it. It won’t land you a high-paying job of the future. But what I want to get at here — and what I think the humanities can teach us, all of us — is the importance of questioning the stories we’ve been told.

crimson_2022_38,"At the beginning of the school year — what seems like eons ago — I took a trip to the eighth floor of the Smith Campus Center searching for information about parking permits and inadvertently walked into an administrative wasteland. Doors upon doors of largely empty offices spanned the corridor, each emblazoned with a name cobbled together from academic-professional buzzwords like “coordinator” and “vice provost.” A few doors vaguely reminded me of emails I had received (and promptly ignored from various Harvard officials or names thrown around in thesearch for University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s successor, but most I had never heard of. As I made my way to the Parking Office, I had to ask myself: Where did all these people come from? And do we really need them here? Concern over administrative bloat has become more salient in recent years as universities, especially elite institutions such as those in the Ivy League, have come under political scrutiny. Rising stars on the right wing have criticized universities as bastions of liberal indoctrination, growing suspicious over the size of endowments like Harvard’s and how exactly such money is spent. After President Joe Biden announced his student loan forgiveness plan, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis railed against universities’ “bloated administrative budgets” and tendency to use high tuition to “expand … the DEI office.” In response to Harvard advocating against taxes on its endowment, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley tweeted that “Universities have become woke hedge funds with students’ and parents’ money.” It is no secret that Harvard and its peers have amassed fortunes that are largely kept safe from the clutches of the Internal Revenue Service — apart from the 1.4 percent excise tax created under President Donald Trump, against which Harvard continues to lobby fiercely. Amidst rhetoric among Harvard students calling for higher taxes on large corporations and the wealthiest Americans, it seems strange that Harvard’s $53.2 billion, Yale’s $42.3 billion, and Princeton’s $37.7 billion are left off the hit list. Ostensibly, universities have this mostly tax-free status because they are charitable institutions serving educational missions, an exemption which dates to one of the first American income tax laws passed in 1894. This status makes sense. Harvard is one of the world’s preeminent universities; surely it has used its billions of dollars of accumulated wealth to primarily invest in its educational program, building an unparalleled roster of top professors, expanding offerings to students, and reducing class sizes. Right? Wrong. Harvard has instead filled its halls with administrators. Across the University, for every academic employee there are approximately 1.45 administrators. When only considering faculty, this ratio jumps to 3.09. Harvard employs 7,024 total full-time administrators, only slightly fewer than the undergraduate population. What do they all do? Most administrators have a legitimate function. I will happily concede that the University does need administration to operate effectively. No professors want to handle Title IX compliance or send institution-wide emails about Covid-19 protocols. Yet of the 7,000-strong horde, it seems that many members’ primary purpose is to squander away tax-free money intended for academic work on initiatives, projects, and committees that provide scant value to anyone’s educational experience. For example, last December, all Faculty of Arts and Sciences affiliates received an email from Dean Claudine Gay announcing the final report of the FAS Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage, a task force itself created by recommendation of the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging. This task force was composed of 24 members: six students, nine faculty members, and nine administrators. The task force produced a 26-page report divided into seven sections, based upon a survey, focus groups, and 15 separate meetings with over 500 people total. The report dedicated seven pages to its recommendations, which ranged from “Clarify institutional authority over FAS visual culture and signage” to “Create a dynamic program of public art in the FAS.” In response to these recommendations, Dean Gay announced the creation of a new administrative post, the “FAS campus curator,” and a new committee, the “FAS Standing Committee on Visual Culture and Signage.” Regardless of your stance on the goal of fostering a more inclusive visual culture, the procedural absurdity is clear. A presidential task force led to the creation of an FAS task force which, after expending significant time, effort, and resources, led to the creation of a single administrative job and a committee with almost the exact name as the second task force. I challenge anyone other than the task force members themselves to identify the value created for a single Harvard student’s educational experience. Such a ridiculous process may seem relatively harmless, but the aggregation of these frivolous, bureaucratic time-and-money-wasters may have made college as outrageously expensive as it is. In 1986, Harvard’s tuition was $10,266 ($27,914 adjusted for inflation . Today, Harvard’s tuition is $52,659, representing an 89 percent increase in real cost. The Harvard education is certainly not 89 percent better than it was 36 short years ago, nor is it 89 percent more difficult to provide. Rather, the increased cost seems to lie within the administration and its tendency to solve problems by hiring even more administrators. In a 25-year timespan within the same window, American colleges added over 500,000 administrators at a hiring rate double that for faculty. I propose that we cut the bloat. Knock on every office door and fire anyone who does not provide significant utility to the institution. However — recognizing the impossibility of convincing the Leviathan to purge itself from its eighth-floor lair — we may need legislative solutions as well, such as tying tax-free status and grants to responsible spending or outright raising the endowment tax. I do not know what specific bill will actually slay the bureaucratic beast. Nevertheless, I am hopeful that growing scrutiny on American higher education will eventually deliver our universities from the administration’s clutches and into the worthy hands of those to whom the institutions rightfully belong: students and teachers.

ubyssey_2022_20,"June 24, 2022 Written byDaphnée Lévesque I always procrastinate my work by going on YouTube. I love a good video. While doing this recently, I remembered some videos that always uplift my mood and make me feel more positive about the world. Here they are. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. This video follows the journey of someone suffering from mental illness and how they learned what supports they needed. InMy Pill Journey, you get a realistic picture of what it’s like to take medication for your mental health and how everyone’s journey is different. I love talking aboutboundaries! Boundaries are so important, but most people find them difficult to implement — myself included! In this video, Brown talks about the importance of boundaries, and how she discovered the value of them through her work as a researcher. What stuck with me was the idea of letting others know what is and is not okay Brown believes that the mistake we often make is we allow people to cross our boundaries, and we end up resentful and judgmental – or ‘sweet’ on the outside, yet bitter on the inside. She says that one of her biggest life lessons was learning how to set boundaries even though it was uncomfortable at first. This video introduces the idea of mindfulness and how mindfulness can help us cope in our everyday life. I enjoy the example in the video — being stuck in traffic. It can be irritating and can leave you feeling angry for hours. But, practicing mindfulness can help you make wise decisions and help you pay attention; as a result, you will feel more grounded in the present moment. As an English literature student, I have a deep love for slam poetry. This clip features one of my favourite poems on body image and body positivity. We live in a world where fatphobia is real — it harms people. Poems like the one in the video remind me that learning to love yourself is important.

Voter intimidation and suppression are increasing around Arizona, and people need to mobilize to protect the right to vote.

They were also barred from speaking to people within those parameters unless they were spoken to first. They were calling for armed vigilantes, which even if no violence happened, it s still threatening, and we have strong witnesses who felt very threatened by their presence, said Pinny Sheoran, the president of the League of Women Voters of Arizona. This is a clear example of voter intimidation and suppression, as ballot drop boxes have proven to be asafe and securemethod of voting. Yet, it took time for any restrictions to be put on the groups seeking to intimidate Maricopa County voters. In late October, the same federal judge, Michael Liburdi, ruled that groups could watch the drop boxes. Liburdi s newer order did not outlaw the monitors entirely, as there is still clear wiggle room. Their allowed presence is a clear cave to the right-wing efforts to suppress and intimidate voters. The occurrence does not stand in a vacuum; it is a historical legacy of the U.S. to exclude people who it does not see fit from voting or otherwise attempting to have power over their own material and social conditions. It is a systemic factor of how the U.S. operates to oppress working people and specifically certain types of working people. If it were a different type of person – someone who looked differently, maybe a different color – who was out there in tactical gear, and they seemed to be intimidating, it s highly likely that those people would be stopped from engaging in those activities, said Patty Ferguson-Bohnee, the director of the ASU Indian Legal Clinic and the coordinator for theNative Vote Election Protection Project. Researchfrom the Brennan Center showed that non-white communities face many more boundaries when voting than white communities do. This is a direct consequence of the U.S. s capitalist society based on domination and exploitation, where those who dominate have the most power to influence democracy. The voter intimidation and suppression that is taking place at Arizona ballot drop boxes are a continuation of that legacy. Explicitly anti-democratic propositions and candidates also sit on the ballot for voters to vote on, both in Arizona and the U.S. READ MORE:Opinion: Arizona voters should oppose anti-democratic candidates and propositions ASU is not excluded from this conversation. As votinghappens onASU s different campuses, the school has a responsibility to protect and encourage voting rights. Arizona State and (other universities are doing nothing, other than sort of an academic exercise, Sheoran said. Places of learning used to be powerful places for the people to show up and fight for democracy and for their rights. Unfortunately, it seems that even our publicly funded universities are focusing to be chasing a different agenda. However, as Ferguson-Bohnee discussed, there are measures that the University can take. On election day, it would be really great if students had the day off. Through that day off, they could participate as poll workers, Ferguson-Bohnee said. I know that there are some voter registration drives on campus, but especially with the voter ID laws, (they should make sure that students are aware of those, how they can meet those ID requirements and whatever the new changes are going to be. ASU students should demand that the school do more to protect and encourage voting in the upcoming elections and beyond. And they should also fight back against the institutions that seek to continue the cycle of oppressing working people. Edited by Sadie Buggle, David Rodish and Luke Chatham.

stanforddaily_2022_87,"What do you call it when thousands of people threaten to rape and murder a woman, online strangers tell her to kill herself and protesters post her home address online so that mobs can seek her out in person? The words that come to mind include “harassment,” “cyberbullying” and “criminal threats.” No decent person would find such behavior acceptable, particularly if they were committed to tolerance, equality and peace. But apparently the rules are different for J.K. Rowling, who, over the past few years has been flooded with death threats and even doxxed by people who claim to be pursuing justice. Her crime? Defending women’s rights. Rowling’s hesitance to embrace policies set forth by transgender advocates is not rooted in bigotry of any sort. Rather, it’s guided by concerns about how these policies have been abused and the subsequent threat to women’s safety. And though no one is obliged to agree with what Rowling has to say, we should at least respect her right to say it without being threatened and maligned. The controversy began in 2019, when Rowling tweeted out in support of Maya Forstater, a British woman wholosther job due to her belief that sex is immutable. (A court ultimatelyruledthat the decision to fire Forstater violated her protections under the Equalities Act. As the situation unfolded, Rowlingtweeted, “Dress however you please. Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with any consenting adult who’ll have you. Live your best life in peace and security. But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real? #IStandWithMaya”. There’s nothing hateful about these sentences; in fact, the Tweet explicitly endorses an extremely socially liberal viewpoint. But the mere support of theideathat sex is real was taken as evidence of undeniable transphobia. The outrage continued in June of 2020 when Rowlingpointed outthe dehumanizing language in anop-edabout “people who menstruate.” She’s hardly the only one to point out the insulting trend of referring to women primarily in terms of their reproductive function, including phrases like “birthing people” and “bodies with vaginas.” Not everyone who menstruates self-identifies as a woman, and not all women menstruate, but menstruation, vaginas and giving birth are still properties of the female body. Denying this is simply illogical, and it makes it more difficult to address aspects of gender inequality such as female genital mutilation, period poverty and maternal mortality. Other outlets’ coverage of the row were overblown to the point of absurdity. VoxaccusedRowling of “perpetuating the type of pernicious hate and misinformation that leads to trans women, especially teens and black trans women, becoming victims of sexual assault” without bothering to explain how the basic fact that women menstruate could account for violent crime.Vogue,VultureandThe Washington Postjoined the chorus, too, doubling down on the denial of basic reality by insisting that menstruation is a “non-gendered” experience. Soon after, Rowling published a rich and poignant essay that culminated in an account of her experience as a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault. This, Rowling explains, is the final reason behind her concerns “about the consequences of the current trans activism”: “When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he’s a woman — and, as I’ve said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones — then you open the door toany and all menwho wish to come inside.” Emphasis is mine. The issue is not with trans people. It’s with policies that allow men to enter spaces designed to keep women safe. And it’s with the people who take advantage of those policies to harass, intimidate, assault and terrorize women in such places. This essay should have opened a door to conversations about balancing trans people’s dignity with women and girls’ safety. You’d think that people invested in ending gender-based violence would be particularly sympathetic to what Rowling has been through. But none of this seemed to matter to theactorswhose careers she launched, the countless media outlets that reported on her “transphobia” as if it were a fact, not an accusation, the former fans who have taken toburningher books (and bragging about it on TikTok , the user behind a since-deleted account thatthreatenedher with a “pipe bomb” and the activists who recentlydoxxedher. (The following day, they took down the post containing Rowling’s address not because encouraging harassment is wrong, butbecausethey had “received an overwhelming amount of … transphobic messages” in response. And despite it all, Rowling refuses to capitulate. Over the last year, she’s continued to use her platform to speak out about thedifficultiesfaced by detransitioners, the concerningtrendof medical professionals prescribing children puberty blockers despite long-term healthrisks, thelunacyof police documenting rapists with male genitalia as women and thefearlesbians face within the LGBT community. Of course, part of why Rowling continues to stand up for what she believes in has to do with the fact that she’s the author of one of the most successful book series in human history. Those who share her beliefs but not her fame have lost their jobs, faced ostracization and been threatened with violence. The demonization of J.K. Rowling is a symptom of an increasingly illiberal climate that stifles dialogue, punishes dissidence and threatens the ideals of a free society. Those of us who believe in the liberal values of tolerance and open-mindedness can no longer remain silent. Support Rowling’s right to speak her mind without fear, and you’ll be defending your own right to do the same. Sit back — or worse, take part in the hate — and you’ll be feeding a monster. As Albus Dumbledore told Hogwarts students at the end of “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” “There will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right.” The rest of us have that choice, too. Let’s make the right one. Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that the photo that initially accompanied this article was not chosen by the author.

crimson_2022_43,"On May 5, after two years ofcommitteeresearch, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay laid out anew processfor denaming — removing names from — Harvard entities. Though theprocesshas flaws — why can’t you, as of today, submit a request to rename a building? — it is reasonable. A denaming request ought to address the person’s life with care, including the moral standards of their own time and the extent to which their legacy is tarnished by problematic actions. Many advocates of denaming have not been so nuanced, however. InThe Crimson Editorial Board’s opinionon the topic, we describe several namesakes of Harvard buildings solely by their worst actions, proclaiming sweepingly that “names affiliated with white supremacy and its atrocities should be the first to go.” I understand where this line of thinking comes from. These offenses, viewed from a modern perspective, are often repugnant, and implicate aspects of our history that still resonate powerfully today. This makes engaging with them deeply personal and emotional. Issues of systemic oppression are extremely important, and we should doall we canto address and change that legacy. However, denaming might not be the right strategy. Many of the namesakes of Harvard entities are people from the old Harvard: University presidents, Massachusetts governors, business tycoons, and the like. And these people had flaws. Take Charles W. Eliot — a member of the Class of 1853, Harvard University President and namesake of Eliot House, he was a staunch opponent of labor unions, in favor of racist policies, and skeptical about educating women. But Eliot, the longest-serving president of Harvard, also elevated the status of the College drastically, embraced courses in the sciences, eliminated strict course requirements to create the modern flexible liberal-arts curriculum, and removed wealth-biased barriers to entering the College like knowledge of Greek. And, while he was in favor of racial segregation, Eliot’s presidency saw Harvard’s first Black graduates, honorees, and professors. There was more to his legacy than the actions we look back on today with shame. Broadly, questions about legacy and memorial should take into account the entire person, assessing actions in both their original moral context and our modern one. There are situations in which denaming is obviously the correct choice — for someone like Robert E. Lee, whose legacy is doing something horrible. But usually the calculus is more complicated. One of the issues most oftencitedin reexaminations of our history is chattel slavery, a horrible injustice, but one that was relatively widespread practice in the 17th century. At least deep down, many seemed to know it was immoral: ministers, for example, urged their congregations to treat enslaved servants with kindness and often published anti-slavery writing. A good test case is the Mathers, father and son. Increase Mather, Class of 1656, was namesake of Mather House, a minister, President of Harvard, and a complicated man. He participated in the Salem Witch Trials yet advocated that they uphold the presumption of innocence. He opposed freedom of religion but made way for scientific advancement, including promoting smallpox inoculation. And he held one slave, given to him late in life by his son, Cotton Mather, Class of 1678, an active participant in the slave trade. We know almost nothing about Increase’s relationship with this slave, only that he freed him in his will. Does this tarnish Increase’s legacy enough that we shouldn’t honor him? I’d argue not — his personal impact on slavery was limited, by the standard of the time, and his choice to largely avoid the practice and ultimately free his slave seems to show that he had doubts. But the same doesn’t hold for Cotton, who was doing much more than just playing along. It’s all well and good to debate the nuances of legacy. But why should we continue to celebrate these people, when there are surely less controversial figures to uphold? Because Harvard rests on the shoulders of those who have built it. And replacing those names with others — even those whose legacies may have been moreupstanding— whitewashes our history. Without them, the next generation will not have an accurate picture of how their new home has developed over time. Choosing to leave names in place does not imply that we condone the namesakes’ bad behavior. Instead, it conveys that despite their flaws, these people did great good for Harvard, and that this good is not overshadowed by an anachronistic re-assessment of their actions. “As we consider removing names, we should examine these lives with humility,” the denaming committee said, “recognizing that our own ideas and behavior may one day be looked upon with dismay by generations to come.” The crimes of the past should not be ignored; Harvard’s history should be told in all its ugliness. And, upon critical assessment, there may bepeople— like Cotton Mather — who deserve retrospective sanction. That’s the purpose, after all, of the denaming request form. All I mean to do, ultimately, is advise caution. We would set a dangerous precedent by striking people from our collective memory when we judge that their actions have fallen too far behind a shifting moral line. And, more broadly, we should not define people by their greatest failures, nor conflate the ills of past societies writ large with the personal character of actors born into and constrained by them. “We should approach our history through reckoning, not forgetting,” the committee on denaming wrote. I agree. Ian D. Svetkey ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Eliot House."
stanforddaily_2022_68,"Dear reader, Our campus was built by earthquakes. Palo Alto is flanked by the San Andreas fault to the west and the Hayward fault to the east. In 1906, and then again in 1989, the ground under Stanford’s campus was rearranged. Two people died. Main Quad buildings shifted on their foundations. Entire library collections were ruined. Statues fell headfirst through the pavement. But afterward — once the shaking stopped — Stanford evolved. The proximity of the disasters made it impossible not to. The 1906 quake spurred immense research efforts in engineering and geology, setting up the University to be a global leader in both fields today. Students mobilized to provide disaster relief in the destroyed cities of San Francisco and San Jose. After 1989, iconic campus landmarks — the Bing Wing, Memorial Church, the Cantor Arts Center — were rebuilt with the integrity necessary to withstand the next crisis. In 2001, the artist Andy Goldsworthy reconfigured 128 tons of sandstone — debris from the destruction 10 years earlier — into a river-like sculpture, buried in the earth behind Palm Drive. There is a lot of debris in our world right now. The past year has been marked by tragedies of all scales, from the global — with the pandemic’s continued toll and the heart-wrenching destruction of war in Ukraine — to the specific, with the recent loss of members of our community. The stories in the issue ask the question: how will we evolve this time? Grind editor Matthew Turk ’24 breaks down the science behind the Marriage Pact, and examines how a generation has come to embrace finding connection via algorithms. Equity Project Director Sarina Deb ’23 gets candid with Stanford students about how the pandemic alleviated or exacerbated their ongoing mental health battles. Staff writer Seamus Allen ’25 follows a Stanford student from her sorority house to the front lines of the Russian invasion. News desk editor Carolyn Stein ’23 examines the past and future of humanities education at Stanford, particularly how Stanford’s Structured Liberal Education program emerged during the Vietnam War era from a campus charged with political debate and dissent. Finally, opinions desk editor Joyce Chen ’25 traces how Stanford’s undergraduate studies came to be dominated by computer science, and questions the implications of an academic culture that favors prestige over passion.

rice_thresher_2022_47,"ByThresher Editorial Board3/8/22 11:33pm After two years, public parties are finally coming back. Two out of four classes of undergraduates have never had the opportunity to attend a public, while juniors had their one year with public culture cut short. Many members of the Rice community are unfamiliar with public parties and all they entail, while others’ experiences are two years removed and they are eager to return to the parties of their underclassmen days. As the return of public parties approaches, the Thresher feels a similar sense of anticipation, but we urge our fellow students to truly embody the culture of care that Rice boasts. Look out for your peers, make sure to support each other in drinking and partying responsibly and be willing to step in and offer assistance. Don’t hesitate to bring someone a glass of water, utilize bystander intervention training from CTIS or, if and when necessary, reach out for additional help. Rice has an alcohol policy that focuses on the reality of college life rather than a poor mimicry of prohibition, and this comes with certain responsibilities. Given the amnesty policy offered to underage students in need of medical attention relating to alcohol, it is our responsibility as members of the community to reach out when that medical attention is needed. While junior and seniors are eager to return to the parties they remember from before COVID, this is a time to recognize that they are the only classes who have experienced large parties like publics; in the case of Beer Bike, only seniors have attended the event on a fully wet campus. Even Dis-O took form in parties scattered across different days and times. Upperclassmen should use their experience to set an example for younger students of what a healthy party culture should look like and to look out for their younger peers. Other groups on campus are aware of this. Students Transforming Rice Into a Violence-Free Environment and the Student Association’s Sexual Assault Prevention committee have been working on addressing thedouble red zonefor sexual harassment which will surely pop up again as publics return and students engage with large parties for the first time. We all deserve to have fun and enjoy ourselves after the last two years, but we need to do so safely. So look out for your peers and show them what culture of care really means. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_146,"Nineteen years ago, on October 17th, 2002, at 8:47 a.m, I was brought into this world. Smiling and wide-eyed, I didn’t even cry as I was pushed out of my mother’s womb into the waiting hands of the doctors surrounding her. Little did I know the incredulous odds of my ascension into this world. About two years earlier, when my mother was 19, she became pregnant with my older sibling. Being 19 years old, how could she have possibly been expected to give up the rest of her life to raise and provide for a child? So she had an abortion. And then two years later, she was pregnant again — except this time, it was with me. Some might argue that this piece of my life should install me as an avid ally of the pro-life movement. But as the one who survived, I am still pro-choice. I am now the very age my mother was when she first got pregnant. As my mother’s daughter, I am now acutely aware of just how vulnerable being young and pregnant made her. Even now that I have achieved my life’s greatest success in making it to Harvard, and gained so many invaluable life lessons throughout my time here, I still do not feel anywhere near mature enough to allow myself to carry a baby to full term. And as a victim of sexual assault, I can only imagine what it would’ve been like had I been impregnated and forced to carry that forced baby. The decision I make every day to wake up and choose to support those who have abortions is a deliberate, intentional one. The fact that I am able to make this decision every day undoubtedly relies on how my mother decided to carry me to term — but even if she had not, there would have been many others in the world making the same decision every day in my absence. As the child who lived, I am comfortable with the knowledge that I might not have. My contribution to this earth is not yet complete — but any such contribution I have made has not been and will not be unique. The crux of the abortion debate is not battling between ideologies of pro-life and pro-choice, but rather failing to understand that our places within this world could have easily been fulfilled by another mind. Another child would have been born on my exact birthdate, made it into Harvard, and contributed something else to society in my vacancy. Knowing the outlook for little girls and women across the country now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned has only strengthened my resolve in my decision. Had I been the product of rape or incest, or had my fetal stage been killing my mother, I would not want to be here today. I would not want to be the source of my mother’s continued grief. I would not want to experience my mother’s residual psychological damage from being forced to carry me after being sexually assaulted. I would not want to live with potential abnormalities or chronic illnesses that would drastically diminish my quality of life, had I been a product of incest. My mother’s mental health would and should always come before the “what if” of my supposed success, defined by men who will never know the gravity of these situations. That is what love is: to make the sacrifice of one’s own life in order to see the ones you love be happy. I know that my mother was ready to become a mom and raise me properly to become the successful person I am today. I am the product of her having a choice to do so. When that choice is stripped away, when women who didn’t want to be mothers are forced to raise children, they cannot put in the effort to raise a child properly. Or worse, young mothers take the decision into their own hands and try dangerous methods of abortion that lead them to kill, scar, and emotionally damage themselves. As my mother’s daughter, I would’ve wanted her to decide to have me. As my mother’s daughter, I would’ve wanted her pregnancy with me to have been safe and filled with love and excitement. As my mother’s daughter, I thank her for having me, but do not burden her with the what if’s of my older sibling. As the daughter who got to live, I am still pro-choice. Kelisha M. Williams ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Kirkland House."
state_press_2022_33,"Dear State Press, you ve got mail. Illustration published on Friday, March 3, 2017. In September 2021, the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR unanimously approvedan 8% salary raise for President Michael Crow, whose salary now stands at just over $770,000. He also accepted payments of $70,000 for housing, $10,000 for transportation and $50,000 for reachingcertain goals. According to theChronicle of Higher Education, Crow s pay reaches nearly $1.1 million, making him one of the highest compensated university administrators in the country. ABOR accepted no questions or comments at the meeting when the raise was approved, which reflects just how ordinary this pay increase is treated, raising questions about the extent to which ASU is not a university, but a veritable corporation with a corporate board and investors. Crow pioneered the idea of a New American University. He largelysucceeded; ASU, regarded as a party school in the past, is now hailed as a research powerhouse — and yes,we are No. 1 in innovation. TheASU charterholds dear the promise of access, claiming the University is to be measured not by whom we exclude, but rather by whom we include. It also claims to assume fundamental responsibility for the economic health of the communities it serves. However,accordingto U.S. News, the median federal student loan debt among ASU students is $20,278. Despite this being lower than the$37,113federal average, which includes students attending expensive private universities, Crow s salary is about 38 times the average ASU student s debt — and this does not account for students who take out private loans. Does Crow s CEO-like pay reasonably further the economic health of our communities? Given the economic insecurity prompted by a deadly, once-in-a-century pandemic, the answer is a resounding no. Students are hamstrung by competing needs such as meals, housing and other expenses. The invisible threat of COVID-19 only heightens anxiety and uncertainty about academic and extracurricular performance. While the decision not to raise tuition for 2021-22 is welcome, no commitment has been rendered to locking tuition rates in the future. Crow can receive up to $35,000 in additional bonuses if he accomplishes more goals in the next three years. With inflation at a 39-year high, expect angry students if there is a proposed tuition raise for the next academic year. The Arizona Constitution holds that college should be as nearly free as possible. Nevertheless, Arizona has seen historic increases in tuition since 2008. ABOR should lock Crow s salary at the current rate until they make good on the constitutional promise of near-free college. ASU s economic responsibility to the community, as outlined by the charter, is far more important than goals like student enrollment. Keeping students financially healthy will pay dividends in terms of alumni donations post-graduation; we are more likely to donate if we incur less debt. Paying Crow a reasonable salary not only adheres to the economic responsibility outlined in the ASU charter and Arizona Constitution, but it reinforces that the president is not a CEO. ASU s unique emphasis on access sets the University apart. Why, then, should the president associate himself with an image not of equity but greed? After all, doesn t such an image deny this promise? Non-profits such as theArizona Student Associationare doing a fine job of advocating for the interests of students in the Legislature. Remember: ABOR and the Crow s office make decisions that impact your education daily. Student debt, tuition costs and Crow s pay are affairs for which you may voice opinions and concerns. The University depends upon your contribution, so please do not remain silent. President Crow s seven-figure income transgresses the inclusion and economic responsibility clauses of the ASU charter. If ABOR continues to unquestionably raise his pay to new mountainous tops, then ASU will be a New American University in name only.

stanforddaily_2022_118,"— Callum Tresnanis a junior studying comparative literature With the end of fraternity rush this weekend, some Stanford underclassmen have received a “bid” — an offer accepting them into a supposedly desirable elite and exclusive social community. When I received a bid to a fraternity my freshman year, I felt a burst of excitement; the social life I wanted seemed possible — good housing (the organization, Sigma Nu, was and still is housed with good food and good parties. I quickly learned that frat life would not live up to these expectations because I, as a queer man, would never feel wholly comfortable, welcomed and celebrated in the fundamentallyheteronormativespace. Following the summer of 2020, amidst a national reckoning with racism and oppression, fraternities paid lip service to inclusivity and reform. It is now 2022. How have they done? Last Friday, I received an email with the subject line: “LGBTQ x Fraternity Life Q&A.” I was struck that these fraternity members didn’t invite any queer members of Abolish Stanford Greek or non-fraternity queer students to talk abouttheirexperiences with fraternity exclusivity, heteronormativity and violence. This is especially significant because the 2021 ASSU Greek Life survey revealed that respondents who identified as LGBTQIA+reportedthe highest levels of support for abolishing Greek Life. To me, this neglect of outside opinions — and outside opinions of queer folks specifically — is characteristic of insular fraternity life and demonstrates a desire to manipulate narratives even in their attempts at reform. This desire is central to fraternity culture. On May 21, 2021, the organization formerly known as Theta Delta Chi (TDX leakeddetailed information to alumni andthe Fountain Hopperabout the events leading up to a late member’s death in January of 2020. The leak was an attempt to rewrite the narrative about the student’s death and to put public pressure on Stanford to accept TDX’s appeal. The members of TDX thought it was perfectly acceptable to share detailed information (albeitfalse information, according to the University about a so-called brother’s last minutes on Earth with the FoHo. This was uniquely sick behavior that traumatized those who are grieving. It revealed an attitude of disregard for human life, for the bereft and for the wider Stanford community. While this event is specific to TDX, it belies an attitude that extends to all fraternity life, including attempted reforms like last Friday’s LGBTQ x Fraternity Life Panel. From these examples, it is clear that fraternities believe that they have the right to control the narratives that shape how the public perceives them. They do this by denying criticism and gatekeeping conversations of reform. For TDX, this meant refusing criticism of organizational failures and rejecting pursuant accountability. For this panel, it meant ignoring potentially critical opinions. There are only two tools that can elevate critical perspectives that counteract the narratives fraternities pedal. The first is personal experience. The more people experience fraternities, the clearer the picture they have. As welearnedin the ASSU Greek Life Survey, each year students are at Stanford, they become more likely to dislike Greek Life. First years have a Greek Life net favorability rating of -9%, and fourth years have a net favorability of -36%. However, because of the pandemic, half of Stanford’s undergraduate body has not been on campus and has not had time to experience frat culture. This means that right now fraternities have near-total control of the narratives about themselves. As rush this year is happening during winter quarter, one quarter earlier than usual, those who are rushing haven’t had the same opportunity to determine if fraternities are right for them or if joining is even ethical. They have to take fraternity members at their word. The second countercurrent to frat power isAbolish Stanford Greek (ASG ,an organization of undergraduates, graduate students and alumni working to de-house IFC fraternities and ISC sororities (i.e. historically white fraternities and sororities . ASGpostsstudent testimonials about experiences with and in Greek Life. ASG is vocal on social media about the reality of fraternity life and its impact on Greek and non-Greek students. It is for these reasons that I was struck on Saturday when the Phi Kappa Psi’s DEI-VIP Committee neglected to invite a single member of Abolish Stanford Greek to the LGBTQ x Fraternity Life Q&A. They ignored ASG voices even though multiple members of ASG — myself included — havespoken publiclyabout our experiences navigating queerness in fraternity life and rush. The panel no doubt stems from the acknowledgment of very real problems of inclusion in Greek Life, and I greatly respect any fraternity’s efforts to speak honestly about queer experience in frat life. However, the recent panel made me realize that fraternity men are controlling who can talk about queer experience in Greek Life. By not inviting ASG nor opinions from other communities such as co-ops, the fraternities demonstrate that they are not interested in giving up narrative power and hearing critique. How can they pursue true reforms without critique? What’s striking is that in both TDX’s attempts at self-salvationandqueer fraternity members’ attempts at reform, they clutch onto narrative power and end up doing harm to vulnerable populations in the Stanford community — the bereft and the queer. Even when they’re trying to be better, fraternities end up doing worse. If this isn’t clear evidence that reform is not worthwhile, I don’t know what is. The Omicron variant has Stanford students even more anxious about social life than ever. But joining a fraternity will not solve your social life. It will not heal Stanford’s community.

rice_thresher_2022_10,"Brandon Chen / Thresher ByIzzie Karohl10/18/22 9:52pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Content warning: This piece contains references to suicide and depression. In December of last year, I drafted an opinion entitled “Dear Rice, We Need to Talk (about suicide .” I chickened out on submitting it to the Thresher because I believed, against my own written argument, that talking about suicidality wouldn’t do anything — wouldn’t prevent death or injury or start the right kind of conversation. I was mostly worried about sending previously-suicidal students back into their own memories, or worse, forcing currently-suicidal students to endure a dialogue so close to their pain. But I believe if we continue in relative silence, the wound will scar, not heal. Rice, we need to talk about suicide. Some seniors might remember the “Rice University Places I Cried” page on Facebook where students disclosed difficult moments and Rice humans, sometimes friends, sometimes strangers, offering support. In a 2018 opinion piece, the page’s moderators rightly warned of its dangers, including the unspoken competition for the most heart-wrenching story and the commodification of pain. For me, their most salient critique was that students would simply post and continue living in distress without seeking or accessing much-needed professional treatment. I worried about this, too. But in reflecting on my three years as a Rice Health Advisor, Orientation-Week mom and STRIVE liaison, I began to see the value of the page, despite its dangers. Yes, it normalized mental illness. At the same time, it normalized voicing one’s pain and asking for help. There are reasons why people initially confide in peers instead of professionals. When I was actively suicidal, I was terrified of being confined to a psych ward — though, in hindsight, inpatient treatment would have been in my best interest. As I slowly opened up to friends, many detected the weight of what I wasn’t yet saying and offered to walk me to the counseling center. Stubbornly, I waited until after trying to end my life to seek treatment, and I can say with confidence there was little any one person could do at the time to prevent my attempt. But in its aftermath, the culmination of each friend’s suggestion to seek treatment led me to real care and real recovery. Walking across the commencement stage in May was so surreal. I had never once envisioned being there. No friend should bear the brunt of mental illnesses’ symptoms in need of professional treatment. However, the reality is that students will commonly be the first to see and hear warning signs. When you believe a friend is telling you they are suicidal, explicitly or implicitly, listen. Reflect back what you are hearing. Ask if they have a plan and/or have acquired supplies to evaluate risk and inform your response. You can let them know you are there for them while also acknowledging that their pain is beyond your scope. Even if they don’t take you up on your suggestion of seeking professional help, know that discussing depression and suicidality can reduce their risk of death or injury. I encourage every student to attend a Question, Persuade, Refer training put on by the Rice Office of Wellbeing and Counseling. Conversations about suicide matter, and being prepared to support a friend, classmate or stranger can be one of the most important things you do in college. My senior year, after former-Miss USA Cheslie Kryst died by suicide, I posted to “Rice Twitter” to let people know that depression was on my mind and that I knew it was on the minds of others, too. A day later, one of my A-team members called me into their kitchen and confronted me about the post, asking me point-blank why I had tried to kill myself when I had so much potential and so much to be grateful for. It was the kind of question that already had an answer; the answer being I was selfish for wanting to die. I felt cornered, defenseless and swallowed whole by shame. I sensed that A-Teams and other adults had never been properly trained on discussing suicide, aside from calling RUPD in emergencies. This is unacceptable. Every residential college adult team member and undergraduate professor needs to learn that there are conversations and steps beyond calling RUPD that reduce suicide risk and protect students. The university should orchestrate this training as soon as possible. Additionally, if y’all can engineer a better version of “Rice Places I Cried” while mitigating its original pitfalls, all the power to you. The forum, whether online or in person, needs to have a low barrier-to-entry and avoid anonymity. When I was shoulder-deep in my depression, it was all the more difficult to admit my thoughts to people who cared about me. I didn’t want to see their worry or crest-fallen faces or their attempts to comfort me with praise I was convinced I didn’t deserve. Crying into the digital void filled with acquaintances and strangers felt easier. More relieving still were the messages from those who had “been there” and offered to chat over Chaus or walk the outer loop. I’m always impressed by the thoughtful, inventive ways Rice students create community for one another. Lastly, I want those of you working through suicidal thoughts to know that recovery is possible. With help, some people no longer experience suicidal thoughts, while others still do and learn to co-exist safely with them. Personally, starting medication and working through the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality framework with a Rice counselor really helped me through my senior year. Sooner or later, I know you will find what works for you. Keep taking it one day at a time and know that simply existing is enough for today. You are never, ever alone in your pain. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2022_14,"I’m balancing my phone on a stack of assorted items so I can get my key in the lock when my mom, watching the ordeal over FaceTime, comments on the large Palestinian flag donning my door. She hesitantly says it looks beautiful. She then proceeds to tell me stories of minority students murdered on their own college campuses for their views. I know she wants me to take down the flag and keep my mouth shut. I’ve been cautious thus far to not flash it in the camera frame when I call her. I think sometimes she forgets that I choose to wear a hijab every day. I have been wearing the hijab, a head covering worn by Muslim women and a symbol of modesty and religious commitment, for more than 10 years now. It is one of the most important parts of my identity. It is also impossible to miss. It’s hard to think of a more glaring visual indicator of being Muslim. If there is ever any Islamophobia around, I am its obvious walking target. There is no more blatant evidence of my beliefs than my hijab — and I could not be more proud of my continual choice, morning after morning, to put it on. I am used to the questions tied to my choice. I grew up in the South, where I was no stranger to the well-meaning “Aren’t you hot in that?” and “If your parents are making you wear it, you can take it off while they’re not here.” I’m lucky that these comments have never fazed me, and I know exactly why: My hijab has always been my choice. It is hard to convey the gravity of privilege that allows me to say that. I live in a country that has never, at least legally, asked me to take it off — see: France’s anti-separatism bill banning students from wearing hijab. Conversely, the U.S. has also never asked me to put it on — see: Iran’s hijab laws and morality police, under which, most recently, Mahsa Amini was detained and died in custody. Amini’s death has sparked global outrage over the past month, from women burning their headscarves during feverish protests in Iran, to women an ocean away in Boston, cutting their hair on the Harvard Bridge in a show of solidarity. Western government officials have released statements and sanctions. Amini’s death and the resulting outrage have flooded all kinds of media outlets, from our personal social media feeds to global newspapers. I find it incredibly inspiring to see the outpouring of support against this clear transgression of rights. I was personally touched by the number of peers that I saw being so vocal on the issue on social media and beyond. That is, until I came across some of them sharing the hashtag #freedomfromhijab. Statements like these are counterintuitive. What are we truly fighting against — the hijab, or restrictions on one’s right to choose? Amini’s death was not due to the hijab, but the lack of autonomy over her own body under the hijab law that led to her detainment — a theme we are all too familiar with. Amini’s death is a symptom of the same problem that plagues India, where women in some states are barred from their choice to actively wear that same hijab, or America, where vital abortion rights are being relentlessly curtailed. I laud my peers atthe Harvard protestin support of Iranian women who emphasized the true meaning of their protest. Signs that read “The problem is not the hijab, the problem is controlling women,” and statements like “I really want people to see that this is not an issue of Islam — this is not the religion that they portray it to be — and I think that is such a common misconception that people in the West are still battling today” — these should be the real focus of the movement. Protests can look very different in different parts of the world. For many Iranian women, protest has involved their choice to take off the hijab. In the West, it can be the exact opposite. I believe myself to be in a constant state of protest. The minute I step out of my room wearing my hijab, I am shouting my beliefs out to the world. Despite the skeptical glances and occasional temptations, my desire to feel spiritually connected through my hijab is enough to spur me on against its potential dangers. Whatever form of protest we take up, there will always be some risk. It is when our desire to preserve our beliefs and rights is strong enough that we willingly take on that risk, that it becomes a testament to our commitment to who we are. I will keep my flag on my door as long as I believe in the cause, just as I keep my scarf wrapped around my head and heart. Labiba Uddin ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Pforzheimer House."
thetech_mit_2022_31,"Many of us know our facilities workers as the friendly faces who brighten our day whenever we see them in our halls, labs, offices, and residences. Our 600 facilities workers — who won their union with SEIU 32BJ 75 years ago — keep MIT safe, open, and running, working tirelessly at all hours of the day to clean, maintain, and repair our labs, offices, homes, and campus. This university, and all of its groundbreaking research and teaching, would grind to a halt without their efforts and contributions. They also kept MIT safe and open throughout the pandemic as essential workers who put their lives and those of their families on the line to allow COVID-19 research to continue on campus. Now, facilities workers are simply asking for a fair union contract that meets the rising cost of living. But, unfortunately, MIT is dragging its feet. MIT’s administration seems to think that our facilities workers deserve what amounts to a pay cut. During the same pandemic year that facilities workers put their and their families’ health at risk,MIT’s endowment skyrocketed by 49% to over $27 billion. Withinflation exceeding 9%earlier this summer, facilities workers came to the negotiating table proposing what they have always won from MIT: a fair raise that justly accounts for the rising cost of living, as well as facilities workers’ critically important contributions to the growing university. MIT has responded with a pittance, initially offering a paltry 1% raise before budging to 2.25% after the facilities workers organized demonstrations on campus. That amounts to a roughly 6-7% pay cut when inflation is taken into account. And that’s not all. The MIT administration is insisting on a drug and alcohol testing policy, which would basically enable MIT to test any worker at any time. Not only is this policy an arbitrary and demeaning invasion of privacy, but it would also open the door for MIT to abuse this testing to discriminate against workers. For example, a supervisor would be able to abuse their position of power to punish a worker who stands up for themselves by forcing them to take a drug test, bullying the worker by threatening their job and livelihood. Where is the respect for our essential workers now? At a time of historic endowment growth, the MIT administration is doubling down on cutting costs at every turn to the detriment of our university and community. For example, MIT is shifting to contracting out graduate housing. The newWest Campus Graduate Residenceunder construction has been leased to and will be fully operated byAmerican Campus Communities, a Texas-based, for-profit real-estate developer. This change will not only exacerbateMIT’s pattern of luxury apartment prices, but could also exclude our unionized facilities workers from working in the new MIT residence, in favor of subcontracted labor. Subcontracting with non-union labor cuts costs by driving down wages, eliminating benefits, and ultimately offering less accountability for MIT. This is at the same time thatMIT closed down our pharmacy and asymptomatic COVID-19 testing. The pattern is clear. MIT s administration continues to chase profits rather than devoting its immense resources to supporting the well-being of the people that keep MIT functioning. But the workers who make this campus run — including our facilities workers, dining workers, librarians, and graduate workers — are fighting back by organizing together through our unions. This fight is not just to improve our working and living conditions, but to build an MIT that truly invests in its people and lives up to its mission. On Wednesday, Sept. 7, ourfacilities workers held a speakout and march, where undergrads,graduate workers, post-docs, and staffcame out in solidarity. The MIT community stands firmly in solidarity with our facilities workers, and we will continue to stand with them until they win the contract they deserve — and beyond. Sign onto the MIT Student Worker Alliance—We Support Our Facilities Workers! petitionhere.

state_press_2022_64,"ASU has gone through six name changes in its 137 year history, beginning as the Territorial Normal School in 1885. At 5 p.m. outside of Old Main on ASU s Tempe campus, students can hear the school s symphonic bells chime the school hymn. When Mirabella resident David Mills first heard them, he started crying. I thought, Holy Toledo, yeah, I remember this! Mills said. Like many residents, Mills was attracted to the University-based retirement community because it felt like coming home to the school he graduated from in 1963. How many students today know that the next (song coming up is going to be the school hymn? What percentage, 10%? I have no idea. The online students wouldn t care at all, Mills said. Will today s students have the same connection that draws older alumni to Mirabella? Nostalgia is a tough sell for a school so different than it was in 1963, or even since ASU President Michael Crow took over in 2002. Crow has demonstrated he can transform higher education by transforming ASU, and it s time the University embraces that by changing its name to reflect that transformation. In 2002, state appropriations contributed almost 40% of the money coming into the University while its roughly 58,000 students contributed a little over 20% in tuition. Today, despite the Arizona constitution requiring that the University, like all public schools in the state, be as nearly free as possible, the Legislature contributes just 10%, while over 152,000 studentsnowpay half, equating $1.7 billion. The state refusing to pay leaves students responsible for covering the difference. To Crow s credit, despite that disproportionate burden on students, the latest data shows enrollment has almost tripled during his tenure.In fact, there are over 61,000 online students this year alone. It doesn t seem fair. The University s naming rights are worth far more than the state is paying. For instance, Don Mullett and his family have been honored with having their name on the new hockeyarenaafter a donation to the program thatequates to almost a quarter of the arena s cost. Hear me out. Our school s name has a history of changing as the school redefines itself. In fact, ASU has gone throughsixname changes in its 137-year history, beginning as the Territorial Normal School in 1885. It was Tempe Normal School or Tempe State Teachers College until 1929, before expanding its boundaries by swapping out the city with the state. We weren t Arizona State University until a ballot initiative passed in 1958. With a presence inCalifornia,Washington, D.C.andHawaii, it s factually incorrect to say the University is just an Arizona school, and if trends continue then online students will soon outnumber in-person students. The school that began as Territorial Normal School has once again grown beyond its boundaries, and tradition dictates we update our moniker. READ MORE:ASU spent hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying California s State Legislature With apologies to our neighbors to the north, the obvious choice would beNew American Universityin honor of Crow s vision. While I understand NAU may not be available, consider this: ASU enrollment is already more than half of the entire University of California system.That s UC Davis, UC San Francisco, UC Berkeley, UC Merced, UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara, UCLA, UC Riverside, UC Irvine, and UC San Diego – combined. Maybe we could catch up even more by just absorbing Northern Arizona altogether? Doubtful. Besides, since ASU already has signage on buildings in Arizona alone fromLake HavasutoMesait may be prudent to find a new name that keeps the initials. America s Scalable University? Closer, but there has to be a better fit. To continue serving everyone in communities, universities must evolve.Panelists on Tuesday talked about creating life-long learners that will thrive in all educational pathways; highlights from the discussion can be found here:https: t.co/KTns0DruoBpic.twitter.com/qGG3Jv2siH One of ASU s most successful growth mechanisms has been theStarbucks College Achievement Program.Forbes reportedin May that nearly 900 Starbucks employees graduated from ASU this past spring, and more than 20,000 Starbucks employees are currently participating. Maybe other corporations would be interested in partnering with ASU. Starbucks only has about 138,000 employees. That s fewer employees than ASU has students. Could you imagine a partnership with a larger company, say, one with 1.6 million employees? Maybe one that shares the values of innovation and scalability? Picture it. AMAZON STARBUCKS UNIVERSITY. It seems a fitting name for a University embracing a corporate growth mindset. Prime innovation to the last drop. It may seem ridiculous at first, but providing access to affordable higher education is a serious matter. Even more so given the growing cost of education, along with the growing cost of pretty much everything else. To be clear, in response to my inquiry, Veronica Sanchez, ASU s media relations and strategic communications director, said in an email there are no plans for a name change at ASU currently. But shouldn t there be? Just think what those companies, or others, might pay for the honor. I imagine Crow could negotiate far more than we re getting from the state. Then the University could once again uphold its constitutional duty. Should we start the bidding at $1.7 billion? Edited by Sadie Buggle, Piper Hansen and Kristen Apolline Castillo.

crimson_2022_111,"While thinking about the faculty vote, anticipated for this Spring, toshiftHarvard College to a system of previous-term course registration, I remembered a faculty discussion about general education. Should requirements be distributed across fields of knowledge, or were some subjects more important than others? Or was it wrong to organize by content at all — would it perhaps be a better idea to teach scientists how humanists think, and vice versa? One colleague offered a simple principle cutting through such abstractions: “We should teach them what we do.” Education, he argued, emerges from the offerings of faculty and academic departments. The mission and scope of the University is the aggregated expertise of the faculty, so we should get the students to follow us as we ply our scholarly trade. Previous-term registration would be, at long last, the victory of this faculty-centric view of education. Caricatures of the preregistration debate are available to suit the audience. One poses it as a battle between administrative convenience and student liberty. Another has it as institutional dedication to high-quality education faced off against student pettiness and unreliability. It’s hard to get past the rhetoric and hypocrisy on both sides without going back to first principles. What is college for? Without any apparent forethought, Harvard has for years been on a path to change its answer to that question. Previous-term registration is another step. Harvard’s view used to be that undergraduate education was about discovery. Students are admitted to no department or major; they have the entire first year and more to learn about academic offerings and to settle on a concentration. It has been considered a mark of personal growth to choose a concentration different from the one on your Harvard application. And under the Harvard model, a concentration was not the defining center of undergraduate education anyway. A liberal education — an education on becoming a free adult — was a voyage of self-discovery. Its success could not be judged by college honors; it could be evaluated only at the end of life. Education was, as President James B. Conant put it, what was left after everything that had been learned was forgotten. Classroom learning was only a piece of this liberal education; for many Harvard students, however much they may have valued their academic experience, extracurriculars were more meaningful experiences. My own career began as a term-time job — I had never touched a computer until I fibbed my way into a programming job in William James Hall. I am far from unique in this scenario: Our understanding of life inside Russia today is heavily informed by a New York Times reporter who cut his teeth writing for The Crimson about general education. Graduate education is sharply different. Given the need to earn a living in their chosen métier, graduate students must be trained according to professional standards; students of the professions need constraint, not freedom. This view of education as training has, by degrees, crept into the College. Social forces — questions about the value of higher education, anxiety about financial security, the national student debt crisis (its limited impact on Harvard graduates notwithstanding — have further contributed to a careerist view of college. Previous-term registration is the natural extension of this career-focused approach to undergraduate education. Especially for first-year students, preregistration makes educational sense only if you think students should arrive knowing what they want to study and college should help them study it. The faculty-centric view of undergraduate education, that the purpose of university education is for faculty to teach students what we do, is also aligned with previous-term registration. It’s not only the scientists who can be charged with treating curious undergraduates as committed acolytes of their discipline. Professors in the social sciences or humanities who greet students searching for meaning in life with lessons on the esoteric vocabulary of their scholarly field are transferring the spirit of their graduate program into undergraduate education. Some will find me the hypocrite here — isn’t the growth in the applied sciences the biggest factor in the professionalization of the college? It’s not so simple. The serendipity that brought many Computer Science students to the field will, regrettably, be rarer in the future, but SEAS will have no enrollment problems under previous-term registration. The consequences for the humanities will be far worse. For every prospective English concentrator who stays in the field because concentration preferences will be stickier under preregistration, two will not show up in English courses at all, they and their families having focused, at home over the summer before their first year, on the importance of courses they associate with material return. Search algorithms will guide them straight to the courses featuring the right words — no worries about distraction by academic curiosity. Other algorithms will efficiently ration the seats in capped courses among the petitioning students. Previous-term registration will make matters cleaner and more orderly; no more messy experiences like the one that a few years ago horrified a student newly arrived from France. What I considered joyful first-week energy he thought appallingly disrespectful, with students lugging their bicycles through the classroom while I was lecturing. “Welcome to Harvard, and to America,” I told him. “You can do what you want here, and that is the way we like it.” Harry R.

crimson_2022_6,"Harvard’s decision tosuspendthe standardized testing requirement for at least the next four application cycles comes with many implications. Since as far as many of us remember, submitting SAT and/or ACT scores has been a requisite for applying to college. We were told that these scores helped admissions boards decide on who could be accepted into their school. When Harvardinitiallywent test-optional, their decision came alongside a slew of other colleges during the unprecedented times of the Covid-19 pandemic. This suspension was later extended through the Class of2026’s application year and, most recently, to the Class of 2030. Removing the standardized test score requirement had to happen in 2020 due to the devastation the Covid-19 pandemic caused to society. In many cases, students quite literally couldn’t take the SAT or ACT due to public health restrictions in place. However, this suspension must end now. Nearly two years into the pandemic, we now know more about the virus and how to reduce the risk of contracting it. Vaccines are now widely available as well, helping reduce the transmission of the coronavirus. Covid-19 is a dangerous disease and its variants pose a threat to public health, but we are learning how to live with the virus as we establish the standards of a “new normal” society. Thus, just as in pre-pandemic times, we should resume the standardized testing requirement. Students across the world apply to Harvard. These students come from various education systems and school programs, each with their own unique experiences. Grade point averages alone, while indicative of one’s success in a particular place, may not be able to predict academic performance in another school. Standardized tests, namely the SAT and ACT, are assessments that are provided nearly everywhere. They can determine how prepared a student is for college, regardless of their background. Suspending the test requirement prevents Harvard’s admissions board from gaining a full understanding of many students’ potential ability to perform well at Harvard. There are variousconcernswith using standardized tests to help determine college admissions, namely how they disadvantage people in lower socioeconomic classes and favor richer students. Although the pandemic exacerbated dire economic conditions of underprivileged individuals, using the SAT and/or ACT as universal tools to determine potential success in college can help low-income students. Richer students havegreateraccess to counselors, extracurricular activities, and advanced courses compared to the less well-off, making it difficult for those in lower socioeconomic backgrounds to stand out as a worthy candidate for competitive schools like Harvard. Scoring high on standardized tests allows low-income students to catch the eye of admissions officers. The concern regarding the disparity in scores between different economic classes should be addressed by finding equitable ways for students to succeed in the SAT or ACT, not by suspending the requirement to submit scores to colleges altogether. Going test optional makes it difficult to determine who should be accepted into a college. William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, stated that students who don’t submit scores will not be disadvantaged due to Harvard’s holistic analysis of applications, but there may be hidden consequences to declining to submit test scores that can affect the future of college applications to Harvard. For example, students with lower test scores could decline to provide their results, inflating test averages for Harvard. The resulting higher SAT and ACT averages can discourage potential applicants from submitting test scores that are not at all low, but appear so in comparison to the inflated average. This would remove one factor in these students’ applications that could have made them look better and boosted their chances in the admissions process. Harvard is a social and intellectual hub where people go to change society and make a positive impact on the world. As such, we should have a universal system to measure college readiness and to help determine who might excel at embodying Harvard’s mission of creating change. Standardized tests are not the only part of college applications, but they can even out the necessarily irregular system of college readiness measurement that comes with a diverse pool of candidates from many different backgrounds.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_9,"Do you know how to assemble a piece of IKEA furniture? If so, you could assemble aghost gun. Ghost guns are firearms that can be bought online and sent to your house for you to assemble with ease. The seller may even include a link to a helpful YouTube video. But there is one catch — they aren’t really considered guns. Well, at least not when you buy them. Since the weapons are sent unassembled in pieces, they are not subject to registration by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF and background checks like other firearms. This lack of regulation allows anyone to buy and assemble powerful, untraceable firearms at home. Ghost guns are real guns, so they must be regulated and treated as such. On April 11th, President Biden in a joint effort with the Department of Justice took the first step toward regulating ghost guns. Biden announced anew rulewhich if implemented, would require all firearms sold online, assembled or not, to have a serial number engraved in them. In addition, sellers would be required to run background checks on all buyers. The new rule would finally treat ghost guns as the real guns they are. While this is a welcome action, like so many other sensible gun control measures, it is long overdue. Since their invention, ghost guns have become increasingly popular, with over 68%of all online sellersbecoming active after 2014. For buyers, it’s easy to find an online seller, pick out a gun kit, pay and have it delivered to their doorstep ready to assemble within weeks. There are no pesky background checks or waiting periods, which are pointsadvertised on some sellers’ websites. Ghost guns are undoubtedly dangerous for many reasons. Firstly, the lack of registration needed to obtain a ghost gun makes themreadily availableto individuals who have been restricted from possessing firearms, allowing deadly weapons to easily flow into the hands of felons, domestic abusers and children. Recently, ghost guns have been showing up in the hands of children in schools at alarming rates. The 2019 shooting atSaugus High Schoolin Santa Clarita, California, left two students dead and three wounded in a matter of sixteen seconds. The weapon used? A .45-caliber pistol constructed from a ghost gun kit bought online. In November 2021, a 15-year-oldPhoenix-area high school student shot and woundeda 16-year-old during an attempt to purchase a ghost gun in a school bathroom. In January 2022 at aMaryland high school, a 17-year-old student used a ghost gun to shoot and critically injure a 15-year-old classmate during a dispute. If the problem of ghost guns in the possession of children at school doesn’t paint a dire enough picture, the number of domestic abusers who obtain these weapons is equally disturbing. In February of this year, a manopened fire in a church in Sacramento, killing his three young daughters and a bystander before turning the gun on himself. The shooter, restricted from possessing a firearm due to a restraining order filed against him, was able to obtain an unregistered, untraceable ghost gun. Ghost guns are clearly ending up in the hands of the wrong people and causing damage; the new rule announced by the Biden administration could stop this to some extent. By requiring background checks and registration, the firearms would not be able to be seamlessly purchased by those restricted from having them. After all, if a person is restricted from possessing a firearm, the rules should still apply, even if it is sold in pieces. A gun is a gun, no matter who assembles it. Like any potential rule related to gun regulation in the United States, the ghost gun rule is being met with intense criticism from gun rights groups and politicians alike. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz,, in collaboration with fellow Republicans Mike Lee , James Lankford and Mike Braun introduced aCongressional Review Act Joint Resolution of Disapprovaljust days after the new rule was announced. The senators argue that the new rule unfairly targets law-abiding gun owners and that it will not have any effect on crime rates. If the gun owners that the aforementioned senators are referring to are indeed law-abiding, then the proposed rule should not be a problem. They will still be able to purchase DIY gun kits online and have them shipped to their doorstep. Ghost guns are not being banned; there will just be safety measures added to the buying process. Ghost guns are real guns and they must be regulated. These firearms cannot be available for anyone, regardless of age or background to buy, construct and use. More lives will be lost if nothing is done. The new rule targeting ghost guns announced by the Biden administration is long overdue and must be adopted. Claire Schad is an Opinion Staff Writer.

stanforddaily_2022_29,"In response to community outrage andnewscoverageof thereported assaultover the weekend, Stanford sent out another email entitled “Campus security.” Its contents were insufficient and left me with more questions than before. If Stanford truly cares about the safety of our community, the university owes us answers, now. First, note that Stanford doesn’t promise to execute the basic security measures the email mentions (“outdoor lighting, keycard access to buildings, security staffing, our blue emergency tower system” . Instead, they pledge to do “additional work to assess where other enhancements in their infrastructure or security protocols would be useful.” What does “additional work” actually mean? Treat our concerns seriously, Stanford. Tell us the concrete steps you are taking. Pledge measurable changes with delivery dates. We are told that “a cross-functional group of university leaders takes the lead on this work.” Are survivors, activists and sexual violence experts included in this “cross-functional group”? What “functions” comprise this group? Again, what measurable work? Creating a committee is not action. On “outdoor lighting”: why is it that I bike home through patches of near-total darkness? I can’t even see my bike lock when I’m parking at night. Why is it that Scary Path, an unlit route on campusnotorious among female students, was only replaced aftertwo yearsof constant student advocacy andexternalmediacoverage? On “keycard access to buildings”: why do I not need my student ID to enter any of my classrooms or buildings this quarter, apart from my dorm? On “blue emergency towers”: why can I recall seeing blue towers in at least two locations wrapped haphazardly with yellow tape? Generations of activists at Stanford have already identified where the university “canmakeusefulimprovements.” We don’t just want “safety features” to be “continually reviewed.” We want visible change right now. Second, Stanford has “temporarily expanded the presence of security staff on the Stanford campus.” This is one change I have actually witnessed over the past two days; however, I’m not convinced that it’s a positive one. The email itself alludes to the “concern” and “anxiety” this change may cause some students, due to the harmful ways in whichsecurity staffingandsurveillance camerashave disproportionately harmed people of color. Besides these concerns, I mostly welcome the physical security measures that Stanford plans to implement if the university will legitimately deliver. These measures will undoubtedly help some studentsfeelsafer on campus. But Stanford’s claim that this security is “intended to help deter any criminal activity” completely mischaracterizes the nature of sexual violence on our campus. The entire email’s sole focus on physical security measures misses the point. Here are thefacts: Eighty-one percent of rapes perpetrated against Stanford undergraduate women took place in auniversity dorm, fraternity house, sorority house or other residential housing. Eighty-six percent of all Stanford men and 85% of all Stanford women reported that the nonconsensual sexual contact they experienced at Stanford wasperpetrated by a Stanford student, alumni or other person associated with Stanford. Eighty-one percent of Stanford men and womenknew or recognized the personwho had non-consensually sexually contacted them. These numbers are not explicable by deficiencies in physical security. Therefore, they cannot be addressed by increasing physical security measures. Since the majority of these crimes happen indoors, out of patrolling police officers’ sight, a stronger police presence can’t meaningfully deter sexual violence. The numbers also cannot be primarily explained by Stanford students being sexist, entitled, racist or a variety of other socioeconomic factors that contribute to sexual violence — for reference, we can compare theoverall rate of nonconsensual sexual contactat peer institutions: 49.2% at Harvard and 44.1% at MIT, compared to Stanford’s 60.8%. To be blunt, sexual abusers at Stanford have reason to think they cangetawaywithit. To get to the root of this issue, Stanford must: To all the students, workers, faculty, parents and alumni of Stanford: Please do not forget your shock. Please do not forget your anger that this is allowed to happen on our campus. Please do not forget all the survivors on our campus who suffer every day from Stanford’s negligence. Please do not forget the fear that we feel. This is not the first time we have been betrayed by Stanford’s inaction. It will not be the last — unless we refuse to move on.

thetech_mit_2022_27,"When I openedThe Tech’s home page a few weeks ago, I was surprised to see a front-page banner ad for Chevron, highlighting their job and internship openings. For those unfamiliar, Chevron is an oil and gas company that traces its roots to Standard Oil. Through its sponsorship of the American Petroleum Institute (API , it has known about anthropogenic global warmingsince at least the 1960s. The company has repeatedly refused to commit to reducing fossil fuel production in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence that we must rapidly do exactly that. I wondered: why wouldThe Tech— a nonprofit student newspaper at an institution whosemissionis to best serve the world — run an ad encouraging students to work for a company that is making that same world uninhabitable? I wrote toThe Tech’s executive board to express this confusion. They explained that they would not print ads advertising dangerous products like cigarettes, diet regimens, or firearms, but that Chevron’s products did not meet this bar. They further explained that readers ofThe Techshould be able to use their own judgment to decide whether to apply to work at Chevron. To say that fossil fuels are not dangerous is to not only deny the existence of a human-caused climate crisis, but also to ignore both the basic reality of the impact of air pollution on the human cardiovascular system, and, in the case of Chevron, the well-documented, devastating health and environmental impacts of their facilities around the world. I assumeThe Techunderstands that pollution poses a danger to human and environmental health and that fossil fuels cause climate change, which is also dangerous. I assume they understand that Chevron extracts, refines, and sells fossil fuels. So maybe there is another reason they refuse to categorize Chevron’s primary product as dangerous. My guess is that they believe that fossil fuels — unlike cigarettes or firearms — are an essential product that our society cannot live without, and Chevron is simply responding to market demand. While it is true that we cannot transition to clean energy overnight, the reason we are not closer to that goal is in large part due to the successful public misinformation and direct lobbying efforts of Chevron and its peers over the past 50 years. WhileChevron claims to supportinternational climate agreements and a carbon tax, the company’s history as a key funder of API — whose board is currently chaired by Chevron’s CEO — tells avery different story. Perhaps most egregious in API’s checkered past is its1998 “Roadmap”created to explicitly sow doubt in settled climate science. I believe thatThe Techshould review its definition of a “dangerous product” and consider the implicit impact of promoting Chevron job opportunities on its home page. MIT students might not — understandably — be aware of Chevron’shistory of lobbying against climate action. Even more troubling, students might interpret Chevron’s placement on the homepage as an implicit moral endorsement of Chevron’s activities, creating the false impression that the company is serious about transitioning away from oil and gas. Chevron’s actions and investments indicate otherwise. The reality is that fossil fuels are among the most dangerous products sold today, and that is only becoming more true as the climate crisis accelerates. There is a relatively tiny number of organizations and individuals benefiting from our continued reliance on fossil fuels and the mass suffering it causes. Chevron is one of these few organizations, and they do not belong in our student newspaper. MIT’s students are too smart to waste their potential on 20th-century technology. The energy transition needs your talents and passion elsewhere. Graham Turk is a first-year master’s student in the Technology and Policy Program focusing on energy policy.

crimson_2022_107,"What’s the first thing you do when someone contracts an infectious disease? Isolate them. In fall 2020, Harvard included in their back-to-campus plan a guarantee of quarantine housing for students testing positive. The system worked; transmission rates were lower than planned, which allowed the administration to choose the most student-dense of their potential spring strategies, renewing the quarantine policy in the meanwhile. Upon return to full undergraduate living density in fall 2021, the established isolation policy remained in place. However, with much of Harvard’s swing housing being used to house the unprecedented 1,965-student Class of 2025, this plan now had a potential failure case — an unmanageable number of cases, and thus zero available beds. Luckily, this didn’t happen; transmission remained low for almost the entire three months. In December, though, the emergence of the more transmissible Omicron variant raised the possibility of a major outbreak upon return to campus for the spring. In response, the college made a new plan,eliminating isolation housingand instead deciding that infected students would quarantine in their rooms. Direct roommates, but not suitemates, could apply for limited alternate living spaces. Therewasconcern, but the policy seemeddefensible; the new variant was less dangerous despite being more transmissible, and the potential of keeping thousands of students in isolation seemed unfeasible. A month or so into the spring semester, the crisis appeared averted; positivity rates were still low. But at the end of February, cases started to spike. The week before spring break, parties were canceled, teachers gave warnings, and the College released new, stricter guidelines for social events and increased testing. Omicron, it seemed, had finally hit. Administrators were quick to blame undergraduates. Dean of the College Rakesh Khuranaplaced the onuson “individual behavior,” offering patronizing guidance to continue being “conscious about masking.” But the mask policy hadn’t changed. And if individual behavior was to blame, why now? Students’ social habits don t change much from semester to semester. Why a sudden surge, in the middle of a local and national lull in cases? The answer is clear. Harvard’s flawed isolation protocols — forgotten when Omicron fizzled — came around and hit us when we weren’t looking. As students tested positive, the virus was allowed to circulate instead of being removed from communities. Slowly but surely, even without high levels of transmission, an insidious wave built, crashing a month into the semester — a crash that was entirely Harvard’s fault. Other colleges still guarantee isolation housing — or, at the very least, housing for roommates of students who test positive for Covid-19. But Harvard doesn’t even make it clear how likely it is that roommates get housing, much less offer it to infected students themselves. And the alternative housing offered isn’t appealing. The request form is difficult to find, and is filled with strict conditions: among other things, a student is not provided with amenities, must eat grab-and-go meals, and must return to their room if they test positive — a policy that contradicts every visceral instinct of pandemic prevention. Moreover, the application reads as if it’s trying to discourage students from applying, with an open-response question asking for “as much information as possible” about the student’s circumstances, because housing “is extremely scarce.” Even after being accepted, many students hadnegative experienceswith alternative housing, having had to deal with poorly managed security and remarking that it felt unfair that they, and not their Covid-19 positive roommates, had to go through the hassle of moving. Many students thus decided to forgo the form, being willing to take the risk of living with someone who had tested positive despite the potential to spread the virus through the student population. In fact, when my roommate tested positive in late March, I chose a third bad option. I had extracurricular commitments that I couldn’t risk missing due to quarantine, and I didn’t trust that I’d get alternative housing, so I slept in the basements of freshman dormitories for a week. Hey, at least I didn’t catch Covid-19. Now, luckily, the mid-semester surge seems to have died down. But it would be beyond stupid to bet against another peak, and when it comes, Harvard’s current policy will fail miserably. A new, dangerous variant could arise, and even though most people at Harvard are vaccinated, many are still vulnerable, including the elderly and immunocompromised. What, then, should Harvard do? A return to isolation housing would be a start, although it would be nice if the administration could provide bettersupportto those in quarantine. The scenario in which the entire school gets Covid-19 at the same time and overwhelms the beds available seems unlikely; even with Omicron, case numbers didn’t skyrocket. And if they did? Harvard’s $53 billion endowment has more than enough leeway for a few extra buildings’ worth of hotel space. At the end of the day, the students in quarantine should be the ones who have the virus. And as much as Harvard shifts the blame to undergraduates, they caused their own outbreak with their callous, short-sighted alternative housing policy. They know the right strategy to control Covid-19, because they used it for a year and a half. It’s due time for it to return. There will be another wave. Let’s not make it worse than it has to be.

state_press_2022_72,"ASU athletes deserve better compensation for the endless hours and work they put in to bring revenue to the university. ASU generated almost $118 million in sports revenue during the 2020-21 calendar year, according to theKnight Commission. ASU has long neglected the athletes who make millions of dollars for the University, as well as athletes not playing in revenue-generating sports. It is long past time due for athletes at ASU, as well as at universities nationwide, to be treated like the workers and human beings they are. Last summer, the NCAA updated itsname, image and likeness rulesto allow athletes to profit off their own images, ending the decades-long ban on university athletes from making money off their personal brands. This change represents a significant step in university athlete rights, and athletes should seize on the momentum of this change to request better conditions and compensation from ASU. The systemic effort to misclassify athletes at universities as not being worthy of compensation runs so deep that it’s in the name we call them. The term “student-athlete” wascoinedby the NCAA in the 1950s to avoid classifying athletes at universities as employees so they wouldn’t have to receive workers benefits. This refusal to grant university athletes the benefits they deserve shows itself in ASU s current shortcomings in athlete compensation and support. Taryn Hankins, a track and field athlete and senior majoring in nursing, wishes the University would better assist with the dietary needs of athletes. “I do wish they would provide a little bit more in terms of nutrition because they push how important it is, Hankins said. I just feel like sometimes it can be a little tough, putting together meals and making sure you’re fueled throughout the day. Maria Kowal, a senior beach volleyball player at ASU majoring in biological sciences, also expressed frustration with the University s lack of nutritional support. “If they covered at least the full week (of meals , I would feel better about it, but they don’t, so that’s one thing I wish they could improve,” Kowal said. Kowal has seen some of her teammates struggling financially, and said that some have had to get jobs, especially if they’re from out of state.” Multiple ASU athletes said they wished their sport received more coverage from ASU, including Kowal, who also spoke to the differences in men s and women s sports coverage. “I think especially with women’s sports, it’s kind of iffy … I feel like they have us there to make sure we have that sport, not necessarily to see us progress, Kowal said. The treatment of female athletes at universities has been undeniably discriminatory in the U.S. The NCAA, for example, hasundervalued and underfundedwomen’s basketball for years. In 2021, the NCAAprovidedmuch better gym accommodations for the men’s basketball tournament compared to the women’s basketball tournament. Victoria Jackson, clinical assistant professor of history and a former ASU track and field athlete, said there are reforms that should be made to make conditions better for female athletes. In an academicpaperfor Arnold Ventures, Jackson wrote, “Organizing Olympic sports separately (from football could enable schools to comply with the gender equity law in substantive ways that expand participation opportunities in line with a scholastic model of sport. Tina Doherty, a fifth-year water polo athlete at ASU, said she feels the stigma around athletes not caring for school work is her “biggest pet peeve” because she has “worked for everything.” Clearly, athletes care about their education, too, and creating “a scholastic model of sport,” as Jackson said, could help athletes like Doherty. While many athletes expressed appreciation and gratitude for the University and its athletics opportunities, they each had complaints. There is a historical context of athletes taking on issues they have had with their compensation, but they haven’t historically been extremely successful — and that isby design. Dave Zirin, the sports editor atThe Nation, said the disempowering of athletes at universities is rooted in how incredibly lucrative college athletics are, particularly college football and college basketball. The more money there is to be made, the more pressure there is to have their labor under lock and key. The lock and key that Zirin spoke of have had direct consequences, and those consequences, according to him, operate at a large scale. “I mean, you hear athletes historically reach for the metaphor of slavery to explain what it’s like to work and not get paid, but also what it’s like to be dehumanized, to be treated as something less than human, like your body is treated as something expendable, Zirin said. I think that the roots of that are deep in racial capitalism in this country.” Athletes in revenue-generating sports aredisproportionatelyBlack people, and they generate billions of dollars for universities while still not being classified as workers. This revenue can come in the form ofmulti-billion dollarmedia deals. Zirin gave a hypothetical situation where a contract increased by $5 billion. Whose blood, sweat and tears have created that $5 billion, and where it should it by all rights go?” he said. It seems obvious – the money should belong, at least partially, to athlete compensation and support. It is clear that for both revenue-generating sports and non-revenue-generating sports, athletes deserve better conditions and compensation. They are human beings and workers who deserve to have their basic needs met, just like the rest of us. The resources are there to make a change. The ASU administration, the NCAA, and the state and federal government should be pressured to ensure that athletes at universities are compensated and supported in the ways they want and deserve.

stanforddaily_2022_91,"Nancy J. Hamilton earned her MA in East Asian Studies at Stanford. She is a former competitive figure skater, coach and 1996 National Masters Bronze Medalist. After the disastrous ending of the Women’s Figure Skating Final at the Beijing Olympics on February 17, many are left wondering, what is wrong with this sport and can it be saved? On a night that ended in emotional pandemonium with team ROC’s simultaneously-occurring multiple meltdowns, there was actually some pretty spectacular skating: Kaori Sakamoto’s sheer brilliance, Wakaba Higuchi’s impeccable musicality, Mariah Bell’s sublime radiance. Unfortunately, what lingers in the mind instead is the bizarre and heart-wrenching conclusion brought to us by team ROC’s toxic implosion. The three Russian entrants, all coached by the infamous Eteri Tutberidze, were favored to sweep the podium. However, just as the events had gotten underway, one of Eteri’s skaters, the 15-year-old gold medal favorite Kamila Valieva, was found to have tested positive for a banned substance during the Russian qualifying event in December. The report cast a pall over the entire women’s event, setting aswirl questions over the extent to whichEteri’s training program, already reputed for its draconian rigor, may haveveered into abuse. What could explain the presence of a cocktail of heart medications, the combination of which is known to enhance endurance, in a 15-year-old girl’s body? This disturbing question, together with the role of Eteri and her training program, is nowunder investigation. However, limiting the inquiry to this one program’s dysfunction misses the larger question: what is driving the relentless push to continue upping the technical content of this sport beyond the limits of the healthy female body? The answer lies in the scoring system. Known as the International Judging System (IJS , it was introduced by the International Skating Union (ISU after the2002 judging scandalthat occurred in the pairs event during the Salt Lake City Olympics. Replacing the old “6.0” system in which judges would rank skaters by relative preference, IJS assigns points for every element a skater can do. The new system was seen as a reform that would protect the sport from judging malfeasance by introducing an objective basis for scoring together with safeguards against judges’ collusion. While one can argue that the system has largely been successful at achieving these aims, it replaces one set of problems with another, incentivizing a voracious appetite for points that endangers the athletes and threatens the future of the sport. The IJS was designed to reward risk-taking. Allotting points for even partially-completed difficult maneuvers, it incentivizes training heretofore unachievable elements, like quadruple jumps. Under this system, it is possible to rack up more points with a botched quad attempt than to land the same triple jump perfectly. This dramatically lifts the lid on points that can be amassed under the technical side of the score — the side that tracks points for completed elements. Yet, the cap on artistic points remains fixed. The result is a system that vastly overweights the technical score relative to the artistic score. When the IJS was introduced, the point distribution was calibrated toward skaters performing mostly triple jumps. The women were not performing quads and the men only sparingly. So there was relative parity between the technical and artistic marks. But now, with the quad revolution, it’s no longer a 50/50 equation; it’s more like 60/40. Take, for example, American Mariah Bell’s Olympic free skate, comprised primarily of triple jumps. Very similar in technical content to the women’s programs of 2002, her program earned scores that reflected a 50/50 ratio of technical to artistic points (68.3 / 68.7 . Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto, with superior speed plus a triple-triple combination lacked by Bell, earned a greater overall score, but still a 51/49 ratio (78.9 / 74.4 . Now, ROC’s Alexandra Trusova, who attempted an earth-shattering 5 quadruple jumps — 4 landed cleanly — scored the highest overall score, with a whopping 60/40 ratio (106.2/71 . The outsized impact of quadruple jumps in the scoring equation fuels a relentless drive to push the technical content of the sport, but at what cost for women’s skating? Eteri’s track record of success with teenage phenoms islittered with a trailof these same skaters burning out or becoming debilitated by the age of 20 if not earlier. Brutal training regimens and restricted diets stunt puberty, keeping bodies lithe and aerodynamic. Poor jumping technique that capitalizes on “pre-rotation” (basically counter-twisting the upper body prior to takeoff in order to unleash rotational speed leaves many of her skaters debilitated. Witness Evgenia Medvedeva, 2018 Olympic Silver medalist, unable to jump 2 years later due tochronic back pain— retired at age 21 and unable to perform many of the elements she formerly enjoyed. Is this the horror show we want? The harm is not limited strictly to Eteri’s skaters. The Russians’ success with quads has pushed skaters worldwide to train these nearly impossible elements. Take Japan’s Rika Kihira, who became Japanese National Champion in 2021 with a quadruple Salchow. Why was she not in Beijing?Injury. How about American Alysa Liu? She wowed the skating world in 2019 when she won the US Championships at the age of 13 with 2 triple Axels; the following year, she won with a quad Lutz. She lost these jumps soon thereafter due to injuries and a growth spurt. After recovering and skating a truly delightful (and quadless program in Beijing, she was asked if she would continue to train the quads. Her answer:No, because every time she trains them she becomes injured. And what about the mental health effects? One needs only to revisit the disturbing aftermath of the women’s Olympic final for a clue. 15-year-old Valieva took the ice last, the week-long saga of the doping inquiry clearly weighing on her slender shoulders. She landed her first jump shakily and then either fell or stepped out of the majority of her remaining elements. After this devastating performance, she was greeted rinkside byEteri harshly demanding“Why did you let go, why did you stop fighting?” As Valieva deteriorated into a pile of tears, her coaches sat steely-eyed, and the disconsolate skater was left to be comforted later by a crew member of the Russian TV broadcast team. Meanwhile, teammate Alexandra Trusova, who felt that her connect-the-dots, quad-packed free skate deserved to win the night, was having a temper tantrum of epic proportions, screaming at her coaches, “I hate this sport, I hate everyone! Where’s MY gold medal!?” And Anna Shcherbakova, the final Russian teammate and now gold medalist, was left to sit alone in the green room staring vacantly into space, clutching a stuffed animal while no one from team Russia came to congratulate her or surround her. Not exactly the Olympic moment one dreams of. And, lastly, the judging of the artistic mark, now called the component score, needs major reform. The component score evaluates thequalityof the skating itself — the basic stroking and edges, the connecting moves, the speed, the flow and the intangibles of performance and interpretation — what is the story, what is the emotional impact? Judges have for years been grossly negligent in their application of this mark, lackadaisically aligning the component score with the technical score. This is lazy and egregious. Case in point — the artistic mark ranking of the competitors in this event, in order from the top: Shcherbakova, Sakamoto, Trusova, Valieva and then everyone else. This is utterly indefensible. Are we to understand that Trusova’s brutalist program with minimal artistic effort is actually better quality skating than the flawlessly executed interpretive genius of Wakaba Higuchi? Or that Valieva’s effort as the distraught skater struggled to finish her program after her soul had left her body — going through the motions detachedly as an empty shell of herself — was somehow better quality skating than the ethereally heartful free skate of Mariah Bell? It is simply not possible to make that argument. It is so wrong, and it needs to change. The ISU must address it or risk that the dystopian ending of this Olympic women’s event becomes a recurring nightmare.

rice_thresher_2022_51,"ByThresher Editorial Board3/1/22 10:52pm Last Monday, we received word that our beloved advisor, Kelley Lash, had passed away. In what was a busy week filled with Student Association election coverage, grappling with indescribable grief then didn’t feel possible. We decided to carry on with our coverage and endorsements as planned — we believed Kelley would have been disappointed if we hadn’t — but we feel ready now to express just how much she meant, and still means, to all of us. Words cannot fully describe the pain and loss we felt and continue to face, and we want to take this opportunity to say something many of us never got the chance to say: goodbye. Walking up to our offices on the second floor of the Rice Memorial Center, we can still see the sign in Kelley’s window overlooking the stairs telling us “You are perfect.” That sign now serves as a reminder that she continues to watch over and support us. This is especially comforting as we move into a new space and towards an uncertain future. We had spent the year discussing with her our potential offices for next year, and once a location had been chosen, Kelley liked to joke that she was particularly excited to lock our current managing editor in the vault that will be in our temporary office. That was the kind of person Kelley was: constantly joking and having fun, but quick to reassure you that she did not, in fact, want to lock anyone in a vault (even if they were dumb for rooting against the Astros . For years, Kelley worked so hard behind the scenes to keep student media going. She defended us from critics, gave us sage advice and was never afraid to tell us when we were in the wrong. Our staff knew her best from her regular critiques, where most of us learned to write. The outpouring of support we have received from around the country in the last week has been nothing short of remarkable. Sometimes, in our Rice bubble, it was easy to forget just how many people’s lives she touched. The messages we’ve received from her family, former students and student media advisors around the country speak to how amazing Kelley was and how much she will be missed in a world that just will not be the same without her.

crimson_2022_55,"For most people, a season of newness is coupled with a cluster of future plans. Whether it’s a new workout regimen, new goals for a relationship, or — as is typical for Harvard students — a new academic approach in pursuit of a 4.0 grade point average, we as humans love to plan for a better future. But that is where the problem lies. We love to plan more than we love to do. It’s a known fact. This past semester, I learned about the behavioral economics of procrastination and present bias through Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics (Microeconomics .” Though this course is a fan favorite at Harvard, it doesn’t take a class to make most of us aware of our delaying tendencies. We procrastinate every day in our lives — and if you’re like me, multiple times every day. But how did I plan on tackling this problem? By making one of my New Year’s resolutions to stop procrastinating. There’s this quote by Cornelius Fichtner that’s very popular in vision boards across the nation: “Planning without action is futile, action without planning is fatal.” I disagree. Planning without action is the furthest thing from futile; in fact, it’s even more fatal than action without planning. When time ticks away without a single move made, planning without action wastes potential to the point of no return. One of the worst things someone can do is trap themself in a continuous loop of planning without ever acting. Such an endless cycle of planning without acting is worse than acting on every opportunity presented — no matter if it ends up good or bad. Either way, you’d learn something about yourself and/or the world. Lessons are best learned actively. Reading something or being told something just doesn’t register the same as experiencing it. Think back to when you learned how to ride a bike. Whether your parents held onto the handlebars alongside you until you got the hang of it, or you started off with a tricycle, then matured to training wheels, and then finally the real thing, at some point you physically rode a bike. Now imagine you had read books and watched videos about riding a bike instead. Does that translate into you being a good bike rider? This has been the subject of much philosophical debate in the form of the thought experimentMary’s Room. Yet I, like many others, lean towards planning over acting. It’s easy to be comfortable with where you are physically, financially, and academically. It’s even easier to wish and plan for a better future. It’s much, much harder to start living for the future you want. In order to really achieve the lives we so desire, we need to impulsively create change. Only our impulses break the planning loop and allow us to reach our end goals. The best things often come on a whim. An impulse made me apply to Harvard. An impulse made me meet my best friends here. An impulse made me take my favorite course, English 179H: “The Harvard Novel,” last term. Impulses are good. They open up possibilities you never even knew existed. An impulsive decision has the ability to transform your life for the better, by pushing you beyond your steady and safe, but limiting and terminal, comfort zone. You can experience new things, as opposed to merely thinking about them, and so you can grow in a way that endlessly planning will never achieve. Impulses prove that you are not a passing spectator in your own life, just going through the motions, but the fully autonomous protagonist, free to alter your life in any way you so choose. The ability to be instinctive is a testament to being alive. From familial expectations to surrounding limitations, in life, it’s easy to follow the path that has been created for you. Spontaneity means straying from the path and forging your own. This semester, I’m ditching the planner in me and embracing the compulsions. I don’t want to overthink everything. Especially at an institution like Harvard, opportunities are all around us. If we shy away from things because they don’t fall neatly into our perfectly drafted life plans, we lose in the end. Being impulsive pays off. Change doesn’t come from planning; it comes from simply doing, and continuing to do. Planning is always going to be a part of our lives, but does it have to encompass every part? There is so much more than what we can imagine in the months before the start of something new. Why should we withhold the joy of unprecedented experience from ourselves? Christina N. Chaperon ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Greenough Hall."
wildcat_arizona_2022_84,"After a year and a half of waiting, graduates of the class of 2020 gathered for an in-person commencement ceremony on the University of Arizona Mall on Nov. 5. The ceremony was held during Homecoming Weekend this year after the original ceremony in May 2020 was canceled as the pandemic raged. We get worried about what comes next in life, but forget to take the time to appreciate where we are right now; now used to be what came next. Realizing that graduation is just around the corner brings a lot of mixed emotions: stress, sadness, accomplishment, and it’s all bittersweet. As the number of days I have left as a college student grow smaller, I have realized how important it is to live in the moment and be fully present. Taking the time to enjoy where you are at and every small detail of your day is what is important. We spend too much time stressing about and planning for our future that we don’t appreciate where we are currently in life. An article byPsychology Todayexplains the importance of living in the moment by stating, “Living in the moment — also calledmindfulness— is a state of active, open, intentional attention on the present. When you become mindful, you realize that you are not your thoughts; you become an observer of your thoughts from moment to moment without judging them.” College is a one-of-a-kind experience filled with many ups and downs throughout the years. Take the time to appreciate all of it, the good and the bad days. Yes, even the days when we completely failed an exam and are eating microwave macaroni and cheese for dinner (again . RELATED:OPINION: Don’t comment on someone’s body, good or bad Before you leave college and end your four years as a student, enjoy every experience you have, from the walks through campus rushing to your next class, the tailgates and football games and the all-nighters with your best friends. These little moments are a big part of our lives. Once the moments are over we can’t go back. Graduating college is scary. It’s hard not to worry about the future from time to time. However, taking time to be present in what is happening around us now is what’s important. When we come to visit campus again after graduation the feeling won’t be the same. We will be visitors looking back on our favorite memories, not students creating them. Enjoy being a college student now, because, as sad as it is to say, our time here is running out. I wish college could last forever, but sadly that’s not the case. Living in the moment, creating memories and building friendships that will last a lifetime is what matters. Our college years won’t last forever but we can take time to create memories that will. Everyone said these years will go by fast, but I didn’t expect them to fly by this fast. Before you know it you will be a senior with only a few months left before you walk across the stage and go from student to alumni. Your time on campus will be up and your college years will be just memories to look back on. Follow Julianna Strano onTwitter Julianna is a senior majoring in journalism and sociology.

state_press_2022_25,"Desert Financial Arena in Tempe is pictured on Monday, April 12, 2021. Desert Financial Arena was built in 1974 and made to hold just over 14,000 people. With the arena being under 50 years old, ASU can make a few small, but meaningful renovations forDesert Financial Arenato become a far more enjoyable place for fans and athletes. DFA is one of two arenas in the Pac-12 opened before 1980 but has yet to receive any renovations — and it is starting to show its age. The center-court scoreboard is very small compared to that of other state universities around the nation, with just four8-foot by 12-footdisplay screens. The Schottenstein Center, whereOhio State Universityholds some of its athletic events, for example, has a center-court scoreboard consisting of four 16-foot by 9-foot screens and eight 6-foot by 10-foot screens, according toOhio State Department of Athletics. The scoreboard is just too small for my liking and is sometimes hard to see the actual gameplay or player stats, depending on where you are seating in the arena, said Tyler Konrad, a sophomore studying sports business. During the UCLA and ASU basketball (game a couple of weeks ago, where I was seated it was hard to see the player s points because of where it was located on the scoreboard and on the other electronic board across from the student section. Enlarging the center-court scoreboard will allow ASU and DFA to have everything they need on one big scoreboard, instead of having one small center-court scoreboard and another smaller scoreboard closer to the roof. The center-court scoreboard shows footage of the game, but there isn t enough room to display detailed lineups and stats, which the smaller scoreboard displays instead. Using OSU as an example again, its large center-court scoreboard allows many different things to be shown, including the game and player stats underneath during the game. But it s not just the DFA scoreboard that needs a renovation, it s also the seating. Most general admission seats at arenas are made out of plastic, including DFA s. DFA can go against the norm by adding cushioning for its seats for comfort. Both student and fan involvement would go up with these updated features because it would show students that ASU athletics cares about what fans want and how they can deliver a better experience at games and events. With more fan involvement comes a better atmosphere for the athletes, driving them to play even harder after feeding off the energy of a rejuvenated crowd. It s not as if ASU doesn t have the financial ability to make these changes. The University was prepared to spend $160 million to renovate the arena until it decided to build the newmulti-purpose arena. Just because ASU pivoted away to build something new does not mean it should ignore renovating the DFA, because let s face it, it needs an upgrade. ASU needs to look into making these improvements at the DFA because it will only increase fan and student involvement, setting the stage to dramatically increase attendance at all sporting events held there.

crimson_2022_150,"Queen Elizabeth II was undoubtedly a graceful leader, a reassuring diplomat, and an idolized celebrity. And while she wasn’t America’s leader, she was certainly our celebrity. Since her death, glowing obituaries and commentaries — and evenseveralanalyseson the future of her pet corgis — have dominated our news media. At Harvard, talk of her greatness andcriticismof the monarchy’s imperial legacy dominate our campus. We make too much of a fuss, both about the good and the contentious. The Queen deserves our respect but not our effervescent and wide-eyed worship. We should admire actions, not ancestry, and the Queen was a stoic witness, not a doer. Many have rebuked the Queen for the atrocities and inequities committed in her name. Royalists say it is silly to fault a constitutional monarch for the actions of her government — for the government holds the real power. She could not comment on the British crimes during the Mau Mau rebellion, for example, because doing so would violate some sense of impartiality. Her neutrality, herboringness, is what made her great, they say. Indeed, we should not fault the Queen for the good or the bad during her tenure — for politicians, not the Queen, were truly in charge. But then why do we celebrate someone so bound by neutrality, who is little more than a figurehead? Yes, a neutral monarch can serve as a necessary glue in a polarized society, and I believe the Queen was a dedicated public servant who glowed with humility and love for country in her boringness. But let’s not pretend her service was wholly selfless. Because of her preservation of the monarchy, her heir, King Charles III, is exempt from up to £9.5 billion in inheritance tax. Perhaps America grew fond of her because she lived for a long time. Indeed, she ruled for a long time. But longevity is not an action and therefore should not be grounds for praise in and of itself. And why did she rule? She didn’t rule because she was the best person for the job (though she very well might have been , or because the people chose her (though the people might well have . She ruled because her father was king, like his father before him, and his father before him. I, like a young Liz Truss did, find the idea that one can be born to rule iniquitous. I imagine hardly any on this campus — or in this country — would disagree. In fact, nothing seems less meritocratic, less American. So, let’s be careful with our praise. We should not laud hereditary and decades-long supremacy just because it enthralls us. We should question how non-egalitarian such a system is, and not exclude the Queen from our skepticism. But if nothing else, she hadgrit, the obituaries and classmates remind me. She did work until the age of 96. Despite my cynicism, I do believe the Queen was a great woman who did much for her country. But cutting ribbons in your late 90s is hardiness not grit. Grit is conviction and resilience. Rosa Parks had grit. Charles de Gaulle had grit. Rosa Parks and Charles de Gaulle changed their countries; the Queen witnessed hers change. Hardiness is respectable but not admirable. Maybe the monarchy works in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms. I’m neither a royalist nor a republican: As an American, I have no stake. But I see no reason for us on this campus or in this country to praise the monarchy or its symbols, despite their longevity, neutrality, or hardiness. I am sure this is a tough time for the Queen’s family and many Britons, and sending our condolences across the pond does little harm. But let’s avoid fixation.

crimson_2022_127,"Harvard’s connections to the fossil fuel industry run deep. From the academic programsawashin fossil fuel conflicts of interest, to the University leaders who sit on the boards of major oil companies, to the Harvard Corporation’s decade-long refusal to divest from fossil fuels, Harvard has consistently put profit over its community. Last September, Harvard finally made a public commitment to do better — to eventually divest its endowment from the companies that are burning our planet — a step that came after 10 years of tireless community organizing and that had an avalanche effect of other schools committing to the same in the months that followed. But this “better” is only a start. If Harvard is serious about its future as a climate leader — and the future of the students it was built to care for — it must go further, and remove oil and gas profiteers like David M. Rubenstein from its governing bodies. Rubenstein is a Wall Street billionaire who has served as a member of the Harvard Corporation since 2017. Since 1987, he has earned enormous profits from the private equity firm he co-founded and co-chairs: The Carlyle Group, which invests heavily in the fossil fuel industry. The Carlyle Group’s portfolio contains more than 70 fossil fuel companies, including some of the worst private oil companies in America. It is a firm that fuels the climate crisis, pollutes and victimizes poor and vulnerable communities, and profits off it all. The Private Equity Stakeholder Project and LittleSis have recently released a report that details The Carlyle Group’s dirtiest partnerships. One is Hilcorp Energy, which The Carlyle Group helped in gobbling up Southwestern fossil fuel assets. Hilcorp is known for massive methane emissions. Methane can have over 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide, and Hilcorp emits more even than a giant like ExxonMobil. Another partnership is with NGP Energy Capital, a firm based in Texas which also has dozens of fossil fuel companies in its portfolio. These companies include Colgate Energy, a polluter of Texas communities that contain disproportionately low-income and Latino people, and Steward Energy, another prime offender with regard to methane emissions. The Philadelphia Energy Solutions oil refinery has Carlyle’s name on it as well. PES dumped toxic air into the Grays Ferry neighborhood of South Philadelphia, a predominantly Black neighborhood. Carlyle loaded PES with debt and extracted enormous payouts that contributed to the refinery’s 2018 bankruptcy. Yet Rubenstein retains his place in the Harvard Corporation, even as his personal financial interests harm Harvard’s own institutional priorities. Such conflicts may weaken the University’s ability to protect its portfolio and fulfill its fiduciary duties while following through with divestment. They might endanger the academic integrity of Harvard’s climate science research and stall the environmental solutions our world sorely needs from leading institutions like Harvard. Moreover, the University simply should not be burnishing the reputations of powerful and wealthy individuals who remain committed to fossil fuels. Harvard claims it is dedicated to a sustainable and just future — without a doubt, it has the potential for amazing leadership in that field. With the prestige of Harvard’s governing bodies, the talent within its research institutions, and the vast amounts of money at its disposal, Harvard has the ability to make the world better. However, the commitments of Harvard and Rubenstein cannot coexist. Rubenstein features his Harvard Corporation membership prominently in his many biographical sketches. Harvard must not continue giving its prestige and its power to someone working toward climate destruction. This call does not come only from Harvard. Rubenstein has a long record of trying to depict himself as a patron of arts and culture to distract from his dangerous record: Aside from serving as a Harvard trustee, Rubenstein also serves as Chairman of Boards of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Economic Club of Washington D.C., the National Gallery of Art, and the University of Chicago. Around the country, activists like the Cleanup Carlyle campaign are raising awareness about his hand in climate chaos — because so long as he puts his personal interests over those of his institutions and the planet, he shouldn’t be able to use these institutions’ names to cover up his profiteering from injustice. Here at Harvard, the call for Rubenstein is this: recuse or resign. Legal ethics 101 says he should have removed himself from votes within the Harvard Corporation that relate to the University’s response to the climate crisis years ago. If he can’t take this basic step now, he should immediately resign from the Harvard Corporation. It’s time for Harvard to do what it has promised: put people and the planet over profit.

state_press_2022_52,"The Fulton Schools Residential Community, Tooker House is pictured on Sept. 7. 2017, in Tempe. ASU recently toldTooker Houseresidents through email that it would charge “the whole building” for damages totaling around $10,000 if it cannot find the individual culprits.This is a gross example of ASU, which has historically neglected its dorm buildings, using its power to demand students pay for damages that pale in comparison to problems the University itself has neglected to fix. A written statement to The State Press from ASU spokesperson Gaby Kemp said, When students sign their license agreement with ASU, they agree to abide by the policies of ASU and University Housing. One of thosepolicies... outlines that students in the community may be charged for damages to the community. “I don’t believe it’s fair, because I haven’t been vandalizing buildings. I haven’t been doing anything toward (the residence in a negative way to affect it,” said Trey Hofmann, a Tooker House resident and a freshman studying mechanical engineering. Tooker House residents should not have to collectively pay for damages to the dorm building, and ASU students and residents should demand that the University stop acting like an all-powerful landlord that cares more about its bottom line than community health. READ MORE:ASU needs to do more to keep students safe in the dorms “I clean up once a week and I’ve never vandalized anything, so why do I have to pay for other people’s mistakes?” Hofmann said. According to the email, the damages include exit signs being torn down or destroyed, ceiling damage, light covers being removed from lighting, and signage missing in the residential space, as well as trash and spills left throughout the building. The email then ends with a reminder to residents: Please remember that not only areYOUa representation ofyourselvesandYOURcommunity,YOUare representation of Tooker House and The Fulton Schools of Engineers. Please remember to respect yourselves, each other, and the items in your community, as this is ourHOME. The situation would be different if ASU had no resources to fix this problem, but the school certainly does. There are many resource pools that ASU could pull from to fix dorm damages and invest in preventative efforts to discourage further vandalism. For one, ASU’s endowment has topped$1.25 billion, according to a press release from this March. The report does not include student housing as an endowment priority. ASU should go to endowment investors that control their donations and make clear that student housing needs to be prioritized. Outside of its endowment, ASU invests millions of dollars in its revenue-generating sports programs, such as football and basketball. ASU is expected to pay out about$4.4 millionto its former head football coach, Herm Edwards, through 2024. It cannot be emphasized enough that Edwards has no role to play with the football team anymore, and the University is paying him millions of dollars while students are told they have to collectively pay for “10k+” in dorm damages. It is outrageous. That’s not to mention ASU President Michael Crow’s ownsalary, which sits at $771,282. If Crow were to make what an average faculty member at the University makes, which is $123,300, that would free up nearly $650,000 for other expenses, such as dorm damages and general student well-being. If Crow were a compassionate leader of the University, he would be willing to take the salary hit. He still is, after all, the chairman of the board of the CIA’s venture capital firm; that paycheck, according to reporting from thePhoenix Business Journal, would likely be enough to cushion a much smaller base salary. Unfortunately, it seems that Crow and the University are not receptive to their students, and this is not a new phenomenon. ASU has been accused of neglecting its dorm buildings by the ASU community aftermoldwas suspected in Vista del Sol, Palo Verde West and Hassayampa. ASU denied those allegations and refused to do anything about them. ASU’s history of pushing financial burdens onto what are effectively student renters and neglecting dorms fits into the larger context of how housing works in the U.S. MARKET FAILURE:It falls on all of us to end the housing crisis Housing is largely a private-sector enterprise, and landlords in many U.S. states can pushpest control andother livelihood expensesonto renters through rental contracts. There may need to be large-scale housing policy changes in the U.S. for housing decrepitude at ASU to shift in a significant way. ASU students should demand that ASU not only pay for Tooker House damages but also make up for previous dorm building negligence and reprioritize resources to ensure student housing allows students to flourish.

crimson_2022_22,"“Maybe you have mono,” a new friend suggested whilst searching the internet, as I lamented a growing list of symptoms: fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and a fever. Just days later, after my first trip to Harvard University Health Services, my diagnosis of mononucleosis was confirmed, and I disappointedly joined the ranks of students who deal with an illness during their first semester of college. Before I officially received my diagnosis, I had already realized that I was not prepared to deal with being sick away from home and my family in California. I lacked a thermometer to verify my fever and food to supplement meal times when I was too exhausted to walk from Pennypacker Hall — the most remote of the freshman dorms — to Annenberg. I didn’t understand how my brand new health insurance worked, and was unsure how to prove to my professors that I was really sick before I had a proper “sick note” from HUHS. Out of desperation, I even offered to send my instructors photos of my brand-new thermometer that read my alarming 101.6 degree fever. At first, I felt very alone as I dealt with these uncertainties, but I soon realized that my experience getting sick less than a month into college was not unique. In recent weeks, I’ve encountered countless friends, entryway-mates, and acquaintances who are dealing with illnesses ranging from Covid-19 to severe sinus infections to the most mysterious and undiagnosable of them all — the “frat or freshman flu.” Besides these personal experiences, countless news outlets have also chronicled this phenomenon.The Daily Pennsylvanianwrote about the “freshman plague” last fall, and The Crimson itself published apiecelast October that referenced a “college sickness” spreading throughout campus. National news organizations likeNBCandU.S. News and World Reporthave also reported on this, offering suggestions for combating the inevitable. The high rates of sickness are most commonly attributed to the increased frequency of contact among students — think communal bathrooms, large lectures, and use of shared spaces like common rooms and libraries — in contrast to the decreased contact students experience while living at home. With this experience being so widespread among freshmen, one might expect Harvard to have some sort of guide for students who are sick besides the suggestion in the student handbook to seek guidance from HUHS. Though HUHS provided me with practical medical advice, they were unable to advise me on how to navigate the stressful logistics of an unfamiliar college lifestyle while sick, beyond a suggestion to speak with my proctor or resident dean to deal with the “academic impact.” While resident deans, proctors, and Peer Advising Fellows contribute to a larger network of support in order to close this gap, it can be hard to understand how to utilize this system when you are new on campus. The issue first-year students face when dealing with sickness is not a lack of adequate resources, but rather a limited understanding of what exactly is available and how to access those things. Harvard must bridge this wide information gap among its younger students. First-year Orientation is the perfect platform for such a conversation to take place and doing so would likely decrease the stress around contracting an illness on campus. Helping students navigate illness on campus is more than providing a brief overview of HUHS in an orientation module or requiring students to get flu and Covid-19 vaccines before the semester ends. It’s increasing awareness about the process for ordering bagged meals from Annenberg, offering specific examples of what your proctor can assist you with while sick, and clearly defining how to report a sickness-related absence (if HUHS has not yet confirmed your diagnosis or been able to see you for an appointment, for instance . Dealing with sickness in college presents a learning curve. While some might argue that this experience presents an opportunity to develop one’s sense of independence and personal accountability, taking the time to make Harvard’s resources widely known makes it easier for students to learn to tackle such a situation on their own. Given the prevalence of the “freshman flu,” a more comprehensive orientation event and guide to handling sickness as a Harvard first-year seem a worthwhile project.

stanforddaily_2022_4,"Stanford is home to justseven co-operative houses, which make up a minority of the total housing available on campus. Nevertheless, co-ops play a disproportionate role in campus life and are often highly sought-after as social hubs that house that all-too-rare Stanford phenomenon — residential community. Before the reorganization of Stanford housing into Neighborhoods in 2021-22, students could either ‘Draw’ into co-opsin a randomized process,or could ‘pre-assign’ inbased on application essays judged by student staff. Ever since the Neighborhoods reorganization, however,pre-assignment has become the only way to enter co-op housing, increasing the importance of this process many-fold. Pre-assignment to co-ops is relatively unique among processes at Stanford insofar as it wholly eliminates any intermediary layer of University oversight, instead leaving it to the discretion and trust of the student staff. Pre-assignment has always been a highly contentious process, and given its importance, we believe it is time to reexamine the process of pre-assignment. This article seeks to suggest remedies to common shortcomings in the process. Pre-assignment haslong been subject to allegationsof nepotism and favoritism, wherein student staff select their friends and previous residents. This is to the detriment of those who have been hitherto excluded from co-op life and would like to be included, but lack a personal connection to the decision-makers on staff. There is also the other possibility that the pre-assignment process could be used as a means to settle personal disputes between student staff and prospective applicants — for example, a staff member who dislikes a certain student could weigh in against that student’s pre-assignment application. Furthermore, we have observed that pre-assignment has been subject to allegations of discrimination, where the conscious and unconscious biases of students may come to the fore. (In a recent example, pre-assignment for the 2022-23 housing year at Enchanted Broccoli Forest was publicly criticized on grounds of racial and religious exclusion in a one-pagepamphletthat was pinned up in and around the co-op, and later circulated online. Whether co-ops have or have not actually practiced discrimination or nepotism is a matter of subjective historical record. If you believe that they have, then the need for reform is crystal clear. Even if you believe that pre-assignment has historically been essentially fair, theprocessremains structurally vulnerable to bias. Further, if you believe that Stanford students would not exploit the opacity of the pre-assignment process, theappearanceof bias still risks undermining student trust in the process and could discourage interest in co-ops, as students may not want to bother playing a game they see as rigged. Reducing the likelihood and appearance of such bias should therefore be of concern for all those who care about the future of co-op life at Stanford. The structural feature responsible for the principal appearance and possible practice of bias in pre-assignment is its opacity. The criteria for assignment, as well as their implementation, are often set unilaterally by the incoming staff, either implicitly or explicitly. These criteria are rarely, if ever, communicated to or developed in consultation with current residents or any other stakeholders. (In a recentexampleof this phenomenon, the Hammarskjold pre-assignment process for the 2022-23 academic year was carried out with no prior disclosure of selection criteria. After resident criticism, an email was circulated that detailed selection criteria that had been unilaterally set by staff. This was far from an exceptional case — the writers can attest to the fact that previous generations of staff did not decide upon or publish criteria either. Some potential reforms to the pre-assignment process we propose are principally to address this lack of transparency. First, we propose that co-ops should make public explicit criteria for pre-assignment, and develop these criteria with the support and consent of the current residents of the house, or in keeping with historical house traditions or any constitutive documents. Second, we propose that staff disclose their personal relationships, if any, with all applicants they consider. Staff should make such disclosures to all other staff involved in the pre-assignment selection process, during the process itself. In addition, if any applicants with personal relationships with staff are accepted to a house, such relationships should be publicly disclosed in an accountability report after pre-assignment is complete (more on this below . Furthermore, staff should recuse themselves from the consideration of applicants they share strong personal relationships with. Third, we propose that staff are held accountable to the pre-assignment criteria that have been set. This may include the publishing of an accountability report, including data such as the number of applicants and the acceptance rate; the number of people accepted from outside the house and the number of returning residents; a diversity report; and an analysis of which criteria were generally satisfied and which ones were not. An essential component of such a report would be a full disclosure of all personal relationships between student staff and successful applicants. Further, staff should report where they fell short in the pre-assignment application process, and where future staff should focus their efforts. For example, if staff found themselves accepting a less diverse house than the criteria demanded or found themselves accepting very few returning residents, they may suggest that future staff not make their mistakes. Fourth, we propose that all co-ops draft and ratify constitutions, if they have not done so already. Such documents may serve as repositories of the values and priorities of each house, enabling continuity across time and serving as a starting point for pre-assignment selection criteria. In the experience of these authors, co-op life has been some of the most vibrant, inclusive, exciting and communal life available at Stanford and beyond. Preserving the integrity of co-ops, protecting them from nepotism and discrimination, and ensuring that they are inclusive of the Stanford community at large, is in the interest of every student. We hope that the critiques and corresponding reforms proposed in this article will advance the governance and management of co-op pre-assignment, safeguarding them for generations to come.

Seeing the first Texas Party since Fall 2019 happen is both a joy and a solemn reminder. Yet another public has come and gone and yet no student DJ has risen to prominence. It may not seem like a problem, but this is critical. Rice DJs play an integral part in campus social life, but they cannot survive and thrive without the help and advocacy of campus socials and the boldness of potential DJs rising to the challenge. In the pre-COVID era at Rice, there was a small but very active community of student DJs who played music at publics and large privates. COVID hit and disrupted so many aspects of life, including the Rice DJ community. With no publics on campus for the foreseeable future, there was no way to build interest to take up the mantle. One by one, the remaining DJs graduated or prematurely retired. When the 2020-2021 school year rolled around, I found myself the last of an endangered species, nearing the point of extinction. When I graduated spring 2021, no campus public DJs remained. Rice publics are uniquely Rice experiences, despite many imperfections. In no other environment will you see hundreds of the nerdiest ex-high schoolers from around the world singing along to Taylor Swift at one moment, throwing it back to Bad Bunny the next and yelling “Beer Bike” during the chorus of that DJ Khaled song before the end of the night. There are traditions to be learned, acquaintances to be met and memories to be made. When the sun goes down and the lights go up, the DJ becomes master of that universe for the next four hours. With a job that important, how can we as a Rice community allow anyone else other than a Rice Owl to be your vibe technician? When you hire out, you leave a lot to chance. A non-Rice DJ doesn’t know the type of music that excites this campus. They don’t know the Orientation Week songs or the unofficial anthems of certain colleges (i.e. Murts’ love for “Kernkraft 400” or Hanszen with “MMMBop” . But if aspiring DJs at Rice don’t get their shot, their platform, their opportunity, you have no choice but to hire out. While alumni like DJ Friendzone, DJ Chaney and myself all love coming back, we’d also love to see more current students take ownership of a small but critical piece of Rice culture. For the socials, there are a few ways you can foster this new regrowth. First, fight for making publics free again, administrative red tape be damned. The very definition and origin of Rice’s public parties is that these are open to everyone, free of charge. Publics are egalitarian at their core, and ticketing them only feeds into the elitist image that Rice so desperately needs to fight against. Increasing access and reducing barriers to big social events like these make DJing seem worthwhile because more people get to hear your music and spread the word about your skill. Ticketing kills the spontaneity of a DJ set drawing attention and building momentum throughout the night, among many other negatives. Hold live auditions to test and recruit new talent; provide references and spread the word if any DJs appear competent and need promotion; generally, be the allies that Rice DJs need in order to survive and thrive. On the flip side, if you are interested in becoming the new generation of Rice DJs, even if this is your last year at Rice, please get some live practice in and put your name out there. Perform live. Be adventurous and bold with what you play, but make sure to choose songs with mass appeal and popularity. When you’re playing to crowds, you can’t be playing only obscure tracks that you like. For God’s sake, diversify your music tastes and inject some global flair. Remixes are welcome as long as you don’t get too weird. Learn to read a crowd and its ebbs & flows. Ask for knowledge and help, even equipment, from those who came before you. Finally, reach out to the socials all across campus about potentially DJing their public. You don’t need a lot of fancy equipment to get started, just your laptop, some DJ software and decent music taste. All the world’s a stage, and as a Rice DJ, it is yours to own and yours to lose. Take the stage and bring the campus DJ community back from total extinction. Banh Mi’s rooting for y’all. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

wildcat_arizona_2022_5,"“Body Image. The subjective concept of one’s physical appearance based on self-observation and the reactions of others.” by Charlotte Astrid/Creative Commons (CC BY 2.0 There are phrases, compliments and comments that we say without even thinking. Comments regarding physical appearance, even if they are meant as a compliment or with good intention, can be harmful to someone’s self-esteem. In a society that glorifies beauty and thinness, many individuals don’t always realize that complimenting and making comments regarding physical characteristics and body types can actually be harmful. Complimenting another individual’s appearance or making a comment regarding their physical features is something that most people don’t see as a negative thing to do. Common phrases regarding physical appearance include: “Stop saying you’re fat, you’re beautiful!” “You look so skinny in that!” “She’s gorgeous for a plus-size model!” “Have you lost/gained weight?” “Wow, are you sure you can eat all that?” “I wish I was as tiny as you!” Commenting on another person’s physical looks, whether that’s weight, height or appearance, can be damaging to their self-esteem. Although these comments are not always meant to be harmful, they are not necessary and can do more harm than good. The phrases individuals say without thinking can be taken in a completely different way than what they were intended to mean. This can cause people to feel insecure, less confident and even body shamed. A Fit Ratedsurveyof over 1,000 people found that about 94% of teenage girls and 64% of boys have felt body-shamed by others. We never know what others are going through or what insecurities they may or may not have. According toDoSomething.org, 91% of women don’t like their bodies. Pointing out the physical characteristics of others may make them feel insecure and as if they need to take drastic measures to change themselves. It’s also important to keep in mind that you never know what another person is going through in life. For example, you may think that asking a person if they have lost weight is a compliment. However, they might be going through something such as sickness, stress or they may be struggling with disordered eating. Society glamorizes weight loss and having a “perfect” body, so naturally many individuals will compliment each other about weight loss without stopping to think about how it could potentially be a negative comment. We also never know what insecurities others have. For example, casually commenting on another individual’s height by saying that they are “so tiny” could be damaging to their confidence and self-esteem if that is one of their major insecurities they have. Comments and even compliments on another individual’s height, weight and looks are dangerous. They reinforce and promote society’s idea that we are only as good as our physical characteristics, which is far from the truth. There is more to an individual than just how they look on the outside. When it comes to compliments we should focus on more meaningful comments. For example, telling another individual how much you like their energy or personality. Comments related to personality are more meaningful than comments related to physical appearance. Follow Julianna Strano onTwitter Julianna is a senior majoring in journalism and sociology.

state_press_2022_7,"Las pasantías no remuneradas se toman ventaja de los estudiantes universitarios y debe haber un cambio en la forma en que las empresas realizan los programas de pasantías. Los estudiantes universitarios de todo el país acuden en masa para encontrar pasantías. Ya sea porque es un requisito del programa de ASU tener un crédito de pasantía para graduarse, o los estudiantes quieren experiencia práctica que ayude a mejorar su currículum, las pasantías son una gran manera para que los estudiantes en edad universitaria se preparen para el empleo. Sin embargo, las pasantías no remuneradas se estan tomando ventaja de los estudiantes universitarios y debe haber un cambio en la forma en que las empresas realizan programas de pasantías. Las pasantías requieren mucho trabajo, ya sea que esto signifique salir en el campo, trabajar en una oficina o en un espacio de laboratorio o trabajar de forma remota. Lo más importante es que una pasantía es un trabajo, y es por eso que los pasantes necesitan ser pagados por el trabajo que hacen. A nadie le gusta trabajar de forma gratuita, y los pasantes no son una excepción. Al tratar estas circunstancias, las empresas que pagan a sus pasantes informan que “más propensos a ser felices en sus puestos que sus compañeros que trabajan en puestos de becarios no remunerados. Los pasantes más felices y de mayor calidad producen un mejor trabajo”, segúnParker Dewey,un sitio web que permite a los estudiantes universitarios y a los graduados recientes encontrar micro pasantías. Esta información muestra que los pasantes tienen más probabilidades de producir un trabajo de calidad cuando se les paga por su trabajo, en lugar de simplemente ganar experiencia y trabajar de forma gratuita. Cuando las personas están felices y motivadas en su entorno de trabajo, permite a las personas mejorar su trabajo, independientemente de cuál sea su tarea, y aprovechar al máximo su tiempo de prácticas. Delaney Field tiene una pasantía no remunerada a través de ASU. Recorta videos de gobernadores durante el apogeo de la pandemia. Los videos se ejecutan entonces a través de un servicio de transcripción para ser evaluado en su carisma. “También estoy bien con que me paguen porque está haciendo avances en la investigación a través de mi pasantía que pueden mejorar las vidas no sólo de la sociedad, sino también de las personas directamente influenciadas por la política”, dijo Field, estudiante de ciencias biomédicas. Esto plantea la cuestión de si los programas de pasantías que no pagan a sus pasantes están explotando a sus pasantes. La respuesta simple es sí. No están recibiendo una compensación financiera por el trabajo que están haciendo, solo la experiencia de trabajar en una profesión que esperan seguir después de la graduación. “A veces lo dejo en un segundo plano solo porque no siento que sea necesariamente una prioridad principal porque no obtengo beneficios directos de inmediato, pero en general siento que sigue siendo una buena oportunidad”, dijo Field. El Departamento de Trabajo ha establecido normas sobre la cuestión del trabajo no remunerado; sin embargo, depende de la empresa anfitriona de la pasantía encontrar las lagunas en estas normas, dependiendo de las circunstancias. Según el Department of Labor, los tribunales han descrito la prueba primaria de los beneficiarios como una prueba flexible, y ningún factor es determinante. En consecuencia, el hecho de que un pasante o un estudiante sea un empleado bajo laFair Labor Standards Actnecesariamente depende de las circunstancias únicas de cada caso. ASUhace un excelente trabajo al enumerar cuáles son los requisitos para una pasantía con respecto a la preparación de la clase y qué debe enviarse al medio al que se postula. La Universidad también enumera el número de horas vinculadas a los créditos para la pasantía. No sólo puede ser agotador, sino que los estudiantes que tienen que pagar su propia matrícula y otras necesidades escolares como el alquiler se apoyan en los trabajos durante todo el año y cuando un estudiante tiene que gestionar esencialmente dos trabajos, uno remunerado y el otro no remunerado, es una tarea enorme que conquistar. ASU puede marcar la diferencia al exigir a sus estudiantes que solo acepten una pasantía para obtener crédito si la pasantía les paga. De esta manera, los estudiantes deben buscar oportunidades pagadas para ponerse en posición de tener éxito. Comuníquense con la periodista aalkalmba@asu.eduy sigan a@adokalm32en Twitter.

thetech_mit_2022_50,"In our everyday world at MIT, there are interdisciplinary task forces, collaborations, and requests for feedback (such as the Quality of Life Survey announced almost every week. These undertakings produce brilliant and innovative solutions to difficult problems because the participants bring diverse opinions and expertise to the table. Thus, it was mystifying, even shocking, to receive a nameless and vague email March 9 from MIT Medical announcing the abrupt end to the MIT Pharmacy, a much loved and precious resource on the campus. What?! How could this be? Believe me, there is no more comforting feeling than sprinting from MIT Medical’s Urgent Care to the warm environment of the Pharmacy and having an antibiotic or antiviral resting on your tongue in less than 15 minutes. No more. But who made this decision? What data was used? What is the larger plan? And most importantly, why does it seem that no one on campus nor any patient at MIT Medical was asked for their input? My sense is that many on campus may feel that the opaque decision-making process behind the fate of the MIT Pharmacy was improper and flawed and does not correspond to MIT’s oft-stated values of transparency and strong concern for each other. “It’s just a shame, that’s all…” Betty Lou McClanahan is a staff member in the Department of Chemistry."
thetech_mit_2022_1,"This January, after MIT’s administration refused to voluntarily recognize the clear majority of graduate workers who signed union cards in support of unionization, they reached out to the MIT Graduate Student Union (MIT-GSU seeking an agreement on fair terms for a vote on graduate worker unionization. We were hopeful that this meant they were genuinely interested in working with graduate workers to make MIT a more equitable community that represents and responds to the needs of all of its members. Graduate workers representing the MIT-GSU met with MIT’s administrators and lawyers multiple times, and we were able to find common ground on several points about the logistics of an election and the need to hold one this semester, reflecting the urgent need for graduate workers to have a say in our working conditions. However, to our shock,the administration insisted that graduate workers funded by fellowships are not workers and sought to use this artificial distinction to deny over 1,000 graduate workers — approximately 20% of all graduate workers — the right to vote on unionization.Because the administration refused to compromise on this point, we could not reach an agreement, leaving the terms of the election to be set by the National Labor Relations Board in the coming weeks. The administration’s position ignores the fact thatgraduate workers funded by fellowships do the same vital work as every other MIT graduate worker.It is difficult to imagine that MIT’s administration is unaware that departments and faculty require graduate workers on fellowship to operate and that, in fact, this is a clear expectation and basic premise of the graduate programs they run. Throughout the Institute, fellows teach and do research with the understanding that this is the work they are paid to do. To say otherwise is to deny the value that graduate workers on fellowship create for MIT through their work. Two of the authors of this piece, Leah and Ruth, are second-year graduate student-workers in the biology department. Both work full-time on research projects, and this academic year, both were required to serve as teaching assistants (TAs in addition to their research duties (although neither was officially designated a TA in their appointment letters . Leah and Ruth are paid the same stipend, work in the same department, and are at the same stage in their PhD programs. Both received appointment letters that specify identical terms of employment. However, according to MIT’s administration, Leah is an MIT employee and eligible to vote in the union election while Ruth is not — simply because Ruth is funded by an internal fellowship, whereas Leah is funded by a research assistantship (RA-ship .This is clearly an arbitrary and unjust distinction. Decisions about whether to fund graduate workers by RA-ship, TA-ship, or fellowship are often made arbitrarily for reasons of administrative convenience, without any difference in work duties. Neither Ruth nor Leah had any say in how they were funded. Moreover, many graduate workers switch back and forth between funding types during their time at MIT. The distinction is so arbitrary that graduate workers may not even know how they are technically funded. The administration argued that first-year graduate students in some departments who are funded by fellowships during rotations or while solely taking classes are not providing work or services for MIT and therefore should not be eligible for union membership or to vote in a union election. However, rotating students perform work for labs during their rotations, and MIT claims ownership of intellectual property produced by rotating students as it does for all other graduate workers. Moreover, at any other job, an employee who was undergoing required training at the beginning of their employment would not be excluded from classification as an employee. MIT’s administration claims to believe that all graduate workers have the right to decide whether or not to form a union. However, this attempt to deny over 1,000 graduate workers the right to vote in a union election reveals that either this claim is blatantly disingenuous or that the administration lacks a fundamental understanding of the work we do. In either case,the administration’s position highlights the need for graduate workers to have a seat at the decision-making table, to democratically shape our own working conditions and negotiate a legally-binding contract with MIT that reflects the value we produce for the Institute and the conditions we need to do our best work. All graduate workers — regardless of their source of funding — needaffordable housing;independent grievance procedures;adequate medical and dental insurance;support and protections for international students; andstronger diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.Support the right ofallgraduate workers to a fair vote on unionization and a voice in shaping our working conditions by signing your union card athttps: mitgsu.org/sign.

crimson_2022_75,"At the beginning of every school year, I repeat the pronunciation of my name about 100 times, correcting my colleagues and professors: “It’s Sung-hay.” (Even this is a scaffolded version of my name; it’s actually supposed to sound more like “Seong-heh.” So when the Registrar at the Graduate School of Design introduced the name recording function during orientation, I eagerly recorded my name on my.harvard’s personal information page, optimistically believing that my laborious beginning-of-year routine of teaching professors how to say my name would soon be needless. However, I quickly realized that the Name Pronunciation feature was just another “inclusivity” tool that is performative and appealing without truly contributing towards anti-discrimination efforts. On Canvas, professors have the option to enable the “Name Pronunciation” tab, though just a few have chosen to activate this function. In one of my few courses with the Name Pronunciation feature, only nine students and three teaching team members out of 51 have recorded their names. Unsurprisingly, nearly all of them have non-anglicized names and are people of color. Students who use the Name Pronunciation feature expect instructors to learn the pronunciation of their names, and for this practice to happen outside of the classroom — not inside the classroom in front of 44 other students. Professors frequently express a desire to correctly pronounce students’ names, so it also makes sense for them to follow through on their intentions by going through the recordings before the first day of class. Some may say that it is too much work for a professor to rehearse name pronunciations for their students, as international students — who often have non-anglicized names — account for 77 percent of those pursuing a degree in Master in Public Administration in International Development. Now, let’s consider the reverse: You’re telling me that all this time, 77 percent of MPA/ID students may have been referred to by an incorrect rendition of their name? On Oct. 13, 2021, Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced the latest updates on Diversity, Equity, and Anti-Racism initiatives, stating that, “Our core values call on us as well to oppose racism and other systemic injustices, using our skills and energies to help build a world with respect and dignity for all.” While this statement and its associated pragmatic efforts are valuable in demonstrating the institution’s commitment to inclusion, it seems reasonable to request that faculty and the administration act upon this higher-level aspiration towards anti-racism by first doing the bare minimum: using the tool that they created in order to say students’ names — specifically, non-anglicized names — correctly. When it comes to practical interactions, microaggressions in the classroom continue to harm students with non-anglicized names, who often belong to under-represented racial and ethnic identities. For example, following the introduction of theTeachlyplatform — which enables professors to get to know students through self-provided learning profiles, including information about backgrounds, interests, and first languages — within HKS in 2017, even the professors who proudly announce their use of this platform cannot help their own bias against certain students with non-anglicized names. Despite the fact that my first language on Teachly is documented as English, I still receive comments on my policy papers such as, “I m very impressed at how effective your exposition is, given that you re not writing in your first language.” Further, even though my Teachly profile includes little to no information — other than my name — that would insinuate my foreignness to Americans, I receive feedback such as, “Really good! Impressed with your grasp of US politics.” Comments like these lead me to wonder: who belongs in the Harvard community as an “American?” Even if you can write and speak proficient English, and understand U.S. politics, others perceive a non-anglicized name as a sign that you are a “foreigner.” If the professor in this case had used the Teachly platform to check their biased assumptions, I might have received constructive academic feedback, like my fellow American peers with “American-sounding” names. We students with non-anglicized names do not pay the Harvard tuition to get complimented for our effective exposition in English or to impress our professors with our grasp of U.S. politics. Naysayers are often quick to diminish the progressive significance of name pronunciation, but the effects of name mispronunciation go beyond a negative personal experience. Within the Harvard community, learners with non-anglicized names may be overlooked for academic opportunities and regularly feel diminished by people in power, all while Harvard insists on its desire to include diverse perspectives. Harvard’s pedagogical commitment to learn from diverse perspectives holds performative weight, especially when the most user-friendly and pragmatic of steps are brushed aside by nearly all professors. Practicing a willingness to listen — literally, to listen to recordings of name pronunciation — brings the Harvard community closer to providing equitable opportunities for learners of all backgrounds, and into the mindset that every earnest step taken towards anti-racism is one worth taking.

crimson_2022_166,"I am the daughter of a nurse. Growing up, I spent dinners listening to the visceral rundown on my mother’s patients — procedures they’d undergone, updates on their diagnoses, treatment plans, and anticipated recoveries. To this, my brother and my dad often reacted with hands-over-ears squeamishness, plates pushed away in disgust. On those evenings in our one-bedroom apartment, teeming with questions and grinning widely, I leaned in to hear more. Against all the caution of my mother’s stories, I wanted to go into medicine. While learning about anatomy and medical terminology are certainly perks of having a nurse as a mother, the most valuable lessons my mother gave me at dinner were not strictly medical in nature. They were about values: humanity, compassion, and empathy. She spoke not just of her patients’ physical suffering but of their home countries, cultures, jobs, and dreams. My mother carried with her the twinkle that sparkled in her patients’ eyes as they looked adoringly at their partners and children spending hours with them despite the plasticky discomfort of the hospital waiting-room chairs. In the ridges of my mother’s tired hands, I could feel her extraordinary efforts to prioritize her patients’ dignity and comfort and, before they were discharged, to teach them how to care for themselves. Through her work on the floor and at the table, she showed the real purpose of medicine — to return humility and agency lost. That’s what I thought it meant to be pre-med. At Harvard it isn’t. Or at least, for far too many, being on the pre-medical track isn’t about upholding the values my mother instilled in me. Many of my pre-med peers chose this path for its hefty salary or prestige and not (as one would hope out of selflessness. And their actions reflect this: rushing to slap their name on as many PubMed articles as possible, concerning themselves primarily with the health of their precious GPAs, and most likely numbering among those whopartied masklessduring a pandemic. While at Harvard, the overturning of Roe v. Wade sent a second tectonic shock through my pre-med world. The moment my roommate burst through my bedroom door to inform me of the leaked draft of the majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson during last semester’s finals season will forever be stained on my frontal lobe. Hunched over my laptop, I paused from editing my final project, speechless as my heart sank and my tired eyes drooped with a different, more profound exhaustion. As an American uterus-owner, the repercussions of a decision made by five Supreme Court Justices do not leave my mind. What haunts me most is a newfound sense of my precarity — the realization that just a few differences separate my circumstances from the dire realities of victims of rape and incest, pregnant people with health complications, and those simply uninterested, unfit, or unprepared for parenthood. As a member of this last group, I can now sense that my station in society is the only thing preventing my government from regarding me as reproductive livestock. As a future doctor, I am preoccupied not just with thoughts of being in their shoes but of one day encountering them as patients in whichever specialty I choose. In this post-Roe world, a long list of additional questions about my future in medicine eats away precious minutes of my sleep each night. Should I prepare to be targeted like Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who saved the life of a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio and now faces threats of investigation despite doing her job? Could I have my medical license revoked, after working tirelessly for years on end and taking on hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, for providing life-saving reproductive care? And the question that troubles me most of all: How will my peers and I respond when expected to deny patients the right to their own bodies? My worry is that we will lend our hands to the destruction of lives impacted by sexual assault, ectopic pregnancy, and unprotected sex by failing to treat abortion as essential healthcare. My hope is that we, America’s pre-meds, won’t shy away from specialties like OB-GYN for fear of future legal battles. Where it already runs too thin, I say to all the pre-meds post-Roe: the medical field needs a higher dose of our compassion. Haley A.

state_press_2022_13,"InFall 2016, ASU began offering Gender Inclusive Housing, meaning students are allowed to room with others of a different assigned gender at birth. ASU has limited space available for Gender Inclusive Housing, and the requests areaccommodated based on availability. That being said, many students interested in Gender Inclusive Housing will apply directly to its designated portal. However, when givenlottery times, students applying for Gender Inclusive Housingcontinue to face problems. This process needs reform to prevent insensitivity and promote respect by taking every single student s needs into consideration. Jupiter Chao, a freshman studying psychology at ASU, said they had difficulty applying to Gender Inclusive Housing for the upcoming academic year. Chao found three other people through the housing portal who all applied to gender-inclusive housing and created a roommate group through the designated portal. When we got our lottery times we all got the same message on the screen that we can t make a roommate group with people of a different gender at birth than yours … But the wording is what really bugged me, especially since they basically undermined the entire process, Chao said. The message was insensitive to students applying for gender-inclusive housing, and shocking after ASU s claims of providing a respectful and safe space in the gender-inclusive housing process, but students are continually misidentified. Chao said even though their situation was resolved, the University never reached out with an apology or update on the housing process as a whole. Previous students have had similar problems with the University continuously deadnaming and misgendering them, leading some to believe that ASU is not actively doing anything substantial to prevent this insensitivity. We were all kind of taken aback, really frustrated because they hadn t mentioned anything about (the insensitive message that we’d seen before … it just came as a shock and none of us were happy about it, Chao said of their experience with the application process. The main problem is not just a difficult and confusing process considering limited availability, it is that the University is clearly insensitive to the very students it claims to cater to. Through theGender Inclusive Housing FAQ page, the University said, Each of the residential colleges does safety programming and activities throughout the year that educate the community members on personal safety, respect for self and others, as well as well-being. ASU should stick to its word and respect all students regardless of demographic, in this case, gender. It seems very hypocritical that ASU offers Gender Inclusive Housing, yet still usesdeadnamesand genders assigned at birth when assessing a student s housing needs. Since deadnaming can occur through generated messages and emails from the University, these need to be kept up to date. Whether it be changingASURITE IDsor using students correct names if they re different from their legal names on student portals, names should be taken into consideration at all times. Furthermore, deadnaming can havedetrimental psychological effectsor be considered an act of psychological violence on the person using a new name. I would rather see an active change to it than just an apology about it or at least changing the wording of it … Because it seems like it s all for nothing if you re making us fill out a form and then putting us through the same process as everyone else with the same criteria, Chao said. The University is prioritizing respect and security for the people who may feel discriminated against in Gender Inclusive Housing, implicitly members of the LGBTQ+ community. But how can ASU claim to be a safe space for people if they continue to disrespect students by using deadnames and referring to them according to their assigned gender at birth? It is clear based on students experiences applying for Gender Inclusive Housing that this process needs to be reformed. Reach the reporter atcijennin@asu.edu.

thetech_mit_2022_46,"Last March, six Asian women were killed in the Atlanta spa shootings. The assailant admitted to having been motivated by a “sex addiction,” a symptom of American imperial sexual attitudes and a long history of gender-based violence against Asian women. For many of us in the MIT Asian American Initiative (AAI and the Asian American community, the Atlanta spa shootings came after an already long rise in hate crimes against our community. Only after these shootings did others start to acknowledge our pain. When asked by MIT administration to assist in planning a vigil space for the community, we did so, despite our grief and anger. The vigil that MIT held did not live up to the commitments the administration had made to us. This includednot announcing the event to the entire MIT community, centering religious voices, failing to plan long-term support for the Asian American community, and not following through on events for Asian American heritage month. After this, we at AAI understood that we require and deserve better from our school. Over the past year, we have been working on theserecommendationsfor MIT. The Asian American community at MIT is one of the largest marginalized groups on campus, encompassing over 21 Asian American cultural groups. However, we still do not have enough culturally competent mental health professionals, representation within faculty, staff, and senior-level administration, or a physical community space. Additionally,few classes are offeredfor Asian Americans to explore, and the broader MIT community to learn about the histories and languages of our heritage. Lastly, the monolithic term “Asian American” fails to acknowledge our vastly different cultures, socioeconomic backgrounds, and experiences, necessitating the disaggregation of data. All of these steps are essential for MIT to provide a truly inclusive and supportive environment for Asian Americans. The global COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected all of our lives in different ways. Our Asian American community has also had to manage the burden of a surge in anti-Asian violence and rhetoric, fearing for ourselves, our families, our friends, and our communities. Between March 2020 and Sept. 2021, over10,370 hate incidentsagainst the Asian American and Pacific Islander community were reported in the United States. Given that Asian communities are one of the communities least likely to report hate incidents due to systemic barriers such as language or distrust about outcomes of reporting, this number is staggering. However, this is nothing new. American history is littered with anti-Asian racism. We remember the 1871 Chinese massacre in Los Angeles, the 1907 Bellingham riots, and the surveillance of South Asian Americans post-9/11. Anti-Asian racism has been magnified by the settler American government throughout our country’s past, from the Chinese Exclusion Act to Alien Land Laws to World War II Japanese internment camps. The continuation of state-sanctioned anti-Asian violence has resulted in the deportation of Southeast Asian refugees and the killings of Christian Hall and Angelo Quinto. Recently, we witnessed the unprovoked killings of Michelle Go and Christina Yuna Lee in New York City. These more recent attacks are symptoms of deeply entrenched anti-Asian racism that has long festered in the U.S. — a manifestation of the white supremacy that this nation relies on. As a result, AAI presents five recommendations for the Institute below, in no particular order. Our student organization does not claim to be the sole voice for the Asian American student population. However, AAI’s members are all Asian American undergraduate students who have come together to write these recommendations based on our experiences. We have spoken to and incorporated feedback from various Asian culture student groups at MIT to make this list as relevant and representative as possible. AAI has also collaborated with over 70 other Asian American student organizations from around the country, through the Intercollegiate Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Coalition, to call on our respective universities to act on many of the following recommendations. MIT must hire culturally competent mental health professionals for the Asian American population. MIT must create a permanent, physical space for Asian American students and increase cultural representation. MIT must offer courses in Asian American studies, expand the level of Asian language classes, and install ethnic studies programs. MIT must hire more Asian American faculty, staff, and senior-level administrators. MIT must disaggregate data of Asian American enrollment, graduation, and admissions by ethnicity.

crimson_2022_63,"To my Black legacy child not yet in this world, I write this letter to you in my sophomore year of college, at a time when — perhaps — the seemingly inflexible status of elite institutions is beginning to change. Within the last decade, major developments have occurred in the movement for colleges and universities to abandon legacy admissions. While some notable universities — such as MIT and Caltech —have never considered one’s legacy status, most colleges do, although they are now starting to reconsider. Schools such asJohns Hopkins UniversityandAmherst College— institutions well-known for producing long lineages of legacy alumni — have decided to remove legacy preference from the admissions process. And recently, theentire state of Coloradodid away with the practice altogether. As a consequence, there has beena great push for Ivy League schools, such as Harvard, to follow suit. And, my child, my feelings about this are complicated. On one hand, I feel strongly that legacy preference in college admissions should end, especially within the Ivy League. When Harvard applicants of legacy status have a nearlyone in three chanceof being admitted — compared to the general one in twenty statistic for non-legacy applicants — it clearly preserves a culture of elitism that cannot be extricated from Harvard’s deep history of racial discrimination. Since 1636 — even before the United States secured its nationhood by way of bloodied chains and fearsome weapons — white male students at Harvard could not only forge a path to greatness for themselves, but accelerate this road for their children. They could sharpen their minds while investing in their bloodlines, ensuring that each iteration of their descendants could attain this educational pedigree with more and more ease. But for others — for people like you and me — this path was forbidden for a terribly long time. It tookmore than 250 yearsfor the first Black person to graduate from Harvard College, and the Black undergraduates who followed were far from greeted warmly. Richard T. Greener ’1870 and other Black students who dared to infiltrate the Ivy League, had to fight fearlessly for their education and for their lives — sleeping in dormitoriesnamed after slaveholders, guarding againstwhite students in pointed white hoods, and enduringforced segregationandegregious harassmentfor nothing more illicit than their Black presence at a white institution. However, even in our new millennium — which those before us had hoped would bring newfound security and peace — Black Harvard students are still battling for the respect of our university. We aredisproportionately targetedby campus police,routinely deniedthe creation of a safe space where we may love and protect each other, and told we are undeserving of our places at elite institutionsby our own instructors. And, on top of all this,less than five percentof Black students at Harvard — compared to one out of five white students — have legacy status. So it is under these circumstances, my child, that I owe it to us both to be honest. More than anything, I want to give you what my ancestors were denied. I want you to have security and prosperity, success, and unimaginable joy. I want to provide for you what many of my white classmates have had for generations — a future paid for in advance. I want this for you because you deserve it — no, because you are owed it, by this school and by this country. You are my legacy child, and a likelier chance of a Harvard admission is a tainted, yet immortal gift. How come it has to expire as soon as it s your turn to have it? I know I sound like a petulant child: “It’s not fair.” Am I not longing for a power that has suppressed our people for ages? I feel like I am being enticed by some sinister force. The goal of white supremacy is to be self-replicating — it is to secure wealth and power for one’s children no matter the cost, no matter who is trampled along the way. I want you to have it all — but never at another’s expense. And, as my legacy child, I am certain that you will be born into a privilege that I was not. You are much more likely to come froma higher tax bracket, and contribute to the long-standing problem ofdisportionate wealthamong Harvard students — a problem that oftendeters low-income high schoolers from even applying.You will have insider knowledge of the college application process, access to tutoring and advisors, and an impressive resume that will reflect the abundance of resources you had at your disposal. You will be far ahead of the curve, and make other kids of less-privileged backgrounds feel like they could never catch up. You would become the very applicant who once disadvantaged students like me. I cannot let this happen. I can’t advocate for a system that was designed to keep us out. Therefore, I must let go of this infinite and poisoned gift. I’m sorry, my child. I promise, I am always thinking of you. Jasmine M. Green ‘24, a Crimson Associate Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Lowell House."

For years, Stanford leadership has gestured toward an interest in environmental justice (EJ . This December, university leaders took an important step in launching the EJ Cluster Hire — originally proposed by theStanford EJ Working Groupin 2018 and widely supported by the Stanford community. The goal is to fill a glaring gap: despite environmental justice being necessary to achieving a sustainable society, we have no environmental justice scholars on the Academic Council Stanford faculty. Yet through candidate interviews during campus visits (the EJ Working Group had no other role in the search , we learned that only one out of eleven interviewees self-identified as an environmental justice scholar. The vast majority of interviewees could not name an EJ scholar. We assert that this search cannot be constituted as the long-awaited “EJ Cluster Hire.” Further, we are highly concerned that Stanford appears willing to co-opt the words “Environmental Justice” without making a commitment to an established field of scholarship. To make this right, we need an intentional Environmental Justice cluster hire that is dedicated to expanding EJ expertise in the newly-minted Doerr School of Sustainability. In the spirit of repair, we have brought these concerns to new school leadership. During a sit-down interview with students a few weeks ago, Dean Arun Majumdar told us (on the record , “You have my commitment that we will be looking at EJ, we will be hiring, and you will have the deep engagement that is necessary and the input from the EJ Working Group. That I can commit to.” We have heard similar statements before. We urge Dean Majumdar to reinvest in environmental justice as the foundation for true sustainability. Indeed, the Doerr School launch presents a unique opportunity to learn from Stanford’s mistakes, create meaningful space for EJ and move us towards a just transition beyond fossil fuels. Can the Doerr School of Sustainability commit to visionary investments beyond big oil? Can the new school’s leadership commit to investing in the knowledge andexpertise of frontline communities? This commitment is essential because achieving sustainability requires attending to the deep divisions and disparities that persist within and across societies. If we are not prioritizing environmental justice as a key framework that encourages research-to-action approaches that engage with the root causes of inequities and racialized oppression linked to environmental degradation, we will fail in our sustainability efforts. Yet with scholarly frameworks from EJ, our students gain the intellectual structures, research methodologies, and ethical understandings they need to avoid reproducing injustice when they go out into the world to “solve” sustainability problems that are deeply connected to ongoing histories of racialized discrimination, dispossession and injustice. EJ scholarship extends beyond engaging with issues of inequality through policy or economic methods. Rather, it is an area of scholarship that centers the experiences, leadership and agency of frontline communities in research.According to thisnational EJ teaching and education databasecoordinated by members of Stanford’s Environmental Justice Working Group and additional partners, it “is a framework at the nexus of social movements and research that centers the leadership and expertise of BIPOC Black Indigenous People of Color voices as it makes intersectional connections between painful histories of environmental racism and processes and practices of rebuilding a more equitable, healthy and safer world.” As with other fields of research, EJ scholarship is rooted in a set of methodologies, literature and research traditions that are mutually recognized among EJ scholars and practitioners. These traditions have been established through the groundbreaking research of Robert Bullard, together with many others, as well as theEJ principlesset by theFirst National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit. While a true EJ cluster hire at Stanford would be a powerful step for our institution, Stanford will not be the first to attempt to fill this gap. We can look to President Biden’searly directivescentering environmental justice and through the creation of theWhite House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. We can even look to Stanford’s peer institutions for guidance. Late last year, Berkeleysuccessfully completedits Climate Equity and Environmental Justice search, bringing on five scholars. Berkeley has also committed to cross-department cluster hires on issues relating to Native American and Indigenous People, Anti-Black Racism and Social Inclusion, Latinx and Democracy, Artificial Intelligence and Inequality and Understanding (Non Citizenship. The new Yale School of the Environmentrecently hiredDorceta Taylor, a preeminent EJ scholar;Gerald Torresis also a professor of Environmental Justice on Yale’s faculty. Washington University St. Louis has anongoing EJ-onlycluster hire, and the University of San Diego is also running acluster hirewith an EJ focus, among other institutions. Moving forward, leadership should reinvest in a real, EJ-only cluster hire.This requires acknowledging that the recent cluster hire does not include environmental justice scholars. An EJ cluster hire cannot be EJ in name alone, but must reflect EJ values and be tailored specifically to EJ scholarship. Further, the hire would ideally follow best practices for diversity, equity and inclusion hires. Dean Majumdar need only engage directly with the students, staff and faculty who have been working to bring EJ to Stanford for years. As we bring together diverse thinkers on campus to create the new school and to address complex problems like climate change — known to create disproportionate levels of harm for historically marginalized communities — we need EJ-centered leadership at the table in decision-making and policy-making. Lacking this, our leadership risks reproducing harm in the form of extractive research and policies that reinscribe disproportionate harm to historically marginalized communities of color. Let us move forward together by engaging with the leadership of frontline communities in our sustainability problem solving.

rice_thresher_2022_67,"ByThresher Editorial Board1/18/22 11:02pm Last Monday, Riceannouncedthat a live video feed of the Academic Quad was available online. Two days later, in response to students raising concerns, Rice announced onTwitterthat the camera would be disabled during Baker 13 runs. The next day, at nearly 11 p.m., three days after the initial announcement, Rice again took to Twitter to say that the camera would bedisabledas the university reviews student concerns. The immediate aftermath of the announcement can best be described as disgruntled, as students expressed concerns over safety, including the potential for stalking and allowing someone to view students walking alone at night. The universityclaimedthe camera did not have the capability to zoom in, which isdefinitivelyfalse. Multiple students also hypothesized that the 24/7 livestreaming camera pointed directly at the statue of William Marsh Rice could be used to monitor studentprotests. To put it mildly, it seems that the student reaction was anything but what the administration expected it to be when future-President Reginald DesRoches enthusiastically encouraged his Twitter followers to “check it out!” Doug Miller, Rice’s director of news and media relations, had a very busy week speaking with what seemed like every news outlet in the city,tellingthem that “the whole idea behind the camera was just to show off how beautiful Rice University is. That was the whole point.” For argument’s sake, we’re going to give the administration the benefit of the doubt and accept their statements that they did not ignore student safety concerns, nor were they attempting to monitor Willy’s Statue, with their placement of the camera. The administration’s reaction to students’ concerns, defensive and surprised, shows a startling lack of awareness. Put simply, it’s clear that they don’t know their students. Outrage from students was so instantaneous and unified that it took only three days for the camera to be turned off. A reaction so swift and merciless can and should have been foreseen by the administration. Moreover, any number of students could have warned about the potential for this reaction had they been consulted prior to the announcement. But as Miller toldHouston Press, they “didn’t think anybody would object to it, to be honest.” Miller latersaidthat the administration conducted their own tests of the camera’s zoom capabilities, so perhaps they did consider the potential nefarious uses for the camera. But discussions around the founder’s statue and its accompanying protests have been everywhere on campus for over a year and a half. To think putting a live video feed of the quad online, including the prominently displayed statue, would not elicit a strong reaction is short sighted at best and ignorant at worst. The fact that such apparent concerns took the administration by surprise is upsetting, to say the least. While we appreciate that student concerns were taken seriously and that the camera is no longer operational for now, our disappointment stems from the lack of forethought given to what we feel were painfully obvious issues with this camera’s placement. Moving forward, we ask that administrators actively consider potential student concerns and reach out for feedback. That these objections were unforeseen speaks to the need for the administration to forge a deeper relationship with the student body. This entire situation could have been avoided with a simple email asking students for their thoughts on the camera’s placement. Instead, we got the chaos of the past week. And all for what, exactly? A cool view of one of the most photographed spots in all of Houston? Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

state_press_2022_44,"Despite progress to bridge the gap between men and women, there is a new wave of viral online misogyny that ASU should take time to denounce and address. There is a growing popularity of shock-value misogyny among young people, which is becoming disturbingly visible in our day-to-day lives. Social media personalitieswho utilize the popularity of shock-value misogyny are often written off as attention-seeking, but the casual and performative misogyny is still incredibly harmful to women and gender relations. The implications of these behaviors should not just be dismissed. Over the past year, infamous internet sensationAndrew Tatehas garnered attention on social media for holding outrageously misogynistic views, including beliefs that women are men’s property, assaulting women for cheating is OK, and how men should date women who are 18 or 19 rather than women in their mid-20 s because they can make an imprint on them. Instead of Tate inhabiting an obscure corner of the internet, he was instead one of the most famous figures on TikTok, where he accumulated 11.6 billion views, before beingbanned from the app in August. While Tate’s views may seem ridiculous, his impressionable audience of young men is seemingly priding themselves on holding the same misogynistic beliefs. On Oct. 27, ASU experienced the phenomenon of performative misogyny firsthand when a man stood outside the Memorial Union wearing a shirt that said: Women Are Property. His behavior attracted large crowds and even police presence, however, he was not removed from campus. Once again, we see men displaying attention-seeking behavior in the form of outrageous misogyny. University and regents professor of women s and gender studies and founding director of the Humanities Lab at ASU Sally Kitch attempted to answer the question as to why this behavior is becoming so common. It seems like a cry of desperation, really, Kitch said. I think it has to do with imagined threats to masculinity and imagined scenarios where women are going to take over and men won’t feel like men. The patriarchy and misogyny are not just harmful to women but havedamaging effects on menas well, Kitch said. The oppressive structure of misogyny does not allow men to know where the rewards of being a man come from, leading them to be susceptible to negative views of women. Kitch understands that the misogynistic behavior on social media is rooted in attention-seeking, but notes that it is still incredibly harmful. The most concerning issue is the physical manifestations of these misogynistic beliefs. TheViolence Policy Centerreports that 2,059 women were killed by men in America in 2020. Of these women, 89% of their perpetrators were men that they knew. The U.S. is ranked 34th globally for intentional female homicides with a rate of 2.6 killings for every 100,000 women. This gender-based killing is now even referred to as femicide. In a society where violence is so prevalent and where weapons are so easily available, it’s dangerous, Kitch said. Although misogynistic views like those held by Tate may seem too outrageous to be real, the irony is lost when rates of violence against women are so disturbingly high. Junior philosophy student Kamden Korn depicted growing up with unrestricted access to the internet and how prominent misogyny is in the media that men consume. For many men, there really is no other alternative (to social media . Nobody else is telling them how to be confident and sure of themselves. Unfortunately, this advice is wrapped up into a world of traditionalist stereotypes of submissive women and generally right-wing viewpoints, Korn said. Korn claims that in order to avoid the pitfalls of social media, one has to be able to interact positively with women in their lives and push themselves to have women friends who can teach them how to maintain healthy relationships with the opposite sex. I have always been friends with women platonically, (and I think this balance showed me the sort of do s and don ts of how to interact with women and not to be a (misogynist , he said. It s really about understanding others for who they are. Similarly, Kitch touched on the understanding of gender that men seem to currently be missing, and how those who seek out this understanding are probably not the ones who need it the most. I would like to see courses in gender and gender relations and race and racial relations required of all of our students so that these issues could be out on the table in a thoughtful way, not just (through slogans and things that get bandied about, she said. Extending Kitch s view to youth education is imperative to combating this misogyny before it becomes a problem. In order to teach young men healthy perceptions of the sexes, schools and universities such as ASU should focus on fostering productive conversations on gender through required gender relations classes and discussions in diversity courses. It is easy to brush off internet personalities like Andrew Tate or immature young men like the one toting a misogynistic shirt on ASU’s Tempe campus, but their outlandish behavior has real-world consequences like femicide and perpetuating persisting cycles of misogyny. Whether through conversations with women friends or seeking out gender relations classes, men should think critically about the media they interact with and actively work to not perpetuate these cycles of misogyny.

crimson_2022_131,"I imagine that many of you aspire to create meaningful change — whether through activism, public service, innovation in business, scientific advances, or art. No matter how great your ambitions, when one considers all that needs fixing in our world, it can be daunting. And as newly minted graduates, the path forward can be difficult to discern. So I offer an insight that I hope might inform your successes and buoy you as you navigate inevitable disappointments. The very fact that you are graduating from Harvard means that you have already acquired one of the most powerful tools available to any of us: reason. By reason, I mean several things. I mean the ability to unearth facts through deep research, to discern the truth through clear-eyed analysis of those facts, and to finally deploy this truth through thoughtful argumentation. Most of you will recognize this process — of research, analysis, and argumentation — as a cornerstone of your academic life here at Harvard. With these skills — and by devoting the time and care necessary to apply them — you have earned your degree. Your grit, your engagement with facts, and your commitment to reason: these are the things I want you to be proud of. These habits of mind will serve you well throughout life. We live in an era that tends to reward volume and certainty. Those who speak loudly often convey great passion. Passion is a powerful force: It has driven my commitment to access and opportunity in and beyond higher education. But it is not enough. In addition to passion, you need reason. Perhaps now more than ever, as we try to make sense of a flood of information bombarding us across countless platforms, we must commit ourselves to the painstaking work of research, of analysis, of argumentation — work that doesn’t necessarily lend itself to clever soundbites, but which is critical to inquiry, and to the pursuit of change. By training, I am a legal scholar and historian of the civil rights movement. Among the many leaders I admire, and whose lives I see as instructive, are those who did the intellectual work required for social change. Consider, for example, Constance Baker Motley. Do you recognize her name? Perhaps not, but make no mistake: she was the civil rights queen. She began working at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in 1945, while still a law student, and she was a crucial figure dismantling Jim Crow laws. She helped litigate Brown v. Board of Education. She fought for Martin Luther King Jr.’s right to march in Birmingham. And in 1966, she achieved an historic first: President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, making her the first Black woman to serve as a federal judge. When Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 accepted President Biden’s nomination to the Supreme Court, she said, “Today, I proudly stand on Judge Motley’s shoulders,” calling Motley’s life and career “a true inspiration to me as I have pursued this professional path.” Motley was, first and foremost, a woman who used reason to shape history. And she was not alone. The greatest moments of change in the 20th century were the result of tireless, hard intellectual work. Sometimes that work is thankless, but there are no shortcuts. As you begin the next chapter in your lives, do not discount the transformative power of your ability to reason. One of the greatest threats to reason is basing our conclusions on insufficient facts, or allowing them to be shaped unduly by our preferences, prejudices, and preconceptions. As W.E.B. Du Bois, another changemaker whom I greatly admire, once wrote: “somebody in each era must make clear the facts with utter disregard to his own wish and desire and belief.” Rely on reason, and you will not need to shout down your critics. With reason, there is no need to belittle, to attack. There is no need to grandstand. A commitment to reason and to deep research in the quest for justice motivated me as I chaired the Presidential Initiative on Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery. During nearly three years of doing the work required to prepare our report and recommendations, I encountered skepticism about my commitment to a lengthy and thorough process of research. I believed that our research would have to speak for itself if we hoped to spark meaningful change. I think it does. The research laid the groundwork for our recommendations, and for the establishment of a legacy of slavery fund that will support redress. Of course, there is no monetary sum that could ever remedy the harms of slavery and its legacies. More must be done. I also realize that some of you — with reason at your disposal — may disagree with the particulars of the committee’s recommendations. I welcome this kind of engagement, and believe it will strengthen the critical work that lies ahead for us. This is another virtue of reason: it gives us grounds on which to engage, even when we disagree. I hope you will take that lesson with you, too. Tomiko Brown-Nagin is the Dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, Chair of the Presidential Initiative on Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery, the Daniel P.S. Paul Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School, and a Professor of History at Harvard University."
thetech_mit_2022_11,"The Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA is proud to publicly endorse the MIT Graduate Student Union (GSU through a landslide community vote of 92% in favor. We acknowledge that the Black student experience at MIT is not monolithic, but nonetheless the vast majority of Black graduate students have gravitated toward the union. There are many reasons for this support, including the fact that with a union, we can use our collective power as graduate workers to win a contract that implements changes the BGSA has advocated for in the past but MIT has failed to address. The public rollout of the unionization effort in late September 2021 came at a particularly important time for our members. In the summer of 2020, theSupport Black Lives (SBL petitionwas released to the MIT community and was popularly endorsed, receiving over 5,000 signatures. The petition, as well as the 2015 BGSA/BSU recommendations demand that MIT release a strategic plan that would increase recruitment and retention of Black grad students (currently3.6% of domestic grad studentsat MIT are Black, compared with over 14% of the general U.S. population , implement in-person diversity and implicit bias training, publish transparent demographic statistics on enrollment and retention, and offer additional resources to help graduate workers cope with race-based stresses. In addition, the petition demanded MIT implement new models for public safety. While the BGSA considered the petition to have largely been a success in terms of community engagement, we also must acknowledge truly how small the impact of that petition is now, almost two years later. There is no strategic plan. There is no new model for public safety. Today, the select few implementation demands being addressed are progressing at a snail’s pace. The lack of substantial, tangible impact from the SBL petition showcases the limits of even the most powerful student advocacy campaigns.Under the current system of working with the MIT administration, the wheels of change turn slowly.Student-advocates across campus share the sentiment that a union is the only way to secure real change at MIT.With a union, we will have the legal bargaining power that is absent from the limited advisory role to MIT’s administration that we have played thus far.The power that comes from a union will allow us to accelerate the pace of change. And with a contract, we can prevent MIT from reneging on its promises to do better. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI is one of thekey issues the MIT GSU is committed to addressing within a union contract, and graduate student unions at other institutionsdemonstrate that major wins in DEI are possible. AtNYU, graduate workers won the creation of a committee comprising union and administration representatives to address campus safety and the role of police on campus. Other graduate worker unions have won commitments to affirmative action in admissions, as well as required reporting of DEI statistics, stronger programs to address discrimination and harassment, and paid positions for students to work on DEI programs and policies (for example,University of MichiganandUMass Amherst . These precedents demonstrate that Black graduate workers at MIT can win policy changes that better support and protect us through unionization. While we do not expect that the MIT administration will grant all of our asks, we trust thatwith a union contract, we and our fellow graduate workers will have the power to win legally binding changes that address our needs in a way BGSA has never been equipped to do before. Through the union, we hope to see the needs of Black and other underrepresented minority students prioritized at this institution. While Black students share many needs with the rest of the grad student body such as grievance procedures, access tohealthcareandaffordable housing, and more, it is particularly important to members of our community that tangible steps be taken to improve DEI at MIT. It is unacceptable that the current timelines for any meaningful DEI improvement are on the scale of years. Changes that members of the BGSA have proposed include funding for additional dedicated DEI student positions, better professional development opportunities (such as funded post-doc positions specifically for historically excluded minority candidates , more Black mental health providers, better access to emergency funding, and a general increase in accountability and transparency from the MIT administration. Additionally, as was a critical part of the SBL petition, meaningful public safety reform is another improvement we hope to see implemented in a timely fashion through unionization. The creation of agraduate student unionis a natural progression of the work started in the SBL petition. The spirit of that petition centered around holding MIT accountable to the students in our community. One of the pillars of any union is that workers can hold employers accountable to their needs. Indeed, the MIT GSU’s national affiliate, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE , and other unions have along history of fighting for justice and equity in the workplace and beyond. By 1954,a full decadebefore the Civil Rights Act went into effect,87% of UE locals had already won non-discrimination clauses in their contracts. The civil rights movement in the 1960s was made possible with the assistance of various labor unions. Justice and solidarity go hand in hand, and that is a motivating factor for our support. We come not from a place of antagonism toward MIT but rather from a place of exhaustion and self-preservation.Many Black people in this community have been deprived of basic decency and respect at MIT, and we feel the GSU is our best chance of ending a seemingly endless uphill battle against an institution that was not built with us in mind. There is much to be won through solidarity and collective power. That is why the BGSA has chosen to endorse the Graduate Student Union, and we encourage other student groups to do the same. Chelsea Onyeador is a fourth-year graduate student-worker in AeroAstro and has served as the Black Graduate Student Association co-President (2019–2020 and Political Action Chair (2020–Present .

rice_thresher_2022_30,"ByThresher Editorial Board8/23/22 9:19pm Every August, as Orientation Week wraps up and the fall semester begins, it feels as if the campus is rejuvenated with new life. That feeling is especially prevalent for students this time around, as this is the first semester to start with fully in-person classes since January of 2020. But what many students might not realize is that this year is also a fresh start administratively. In addition to welcoming a new president, Rice announced the hiring of five new vice presidents and a new provost. In many ways, this year is the closest thing to a clean slate this university has seen in many years. Both students and the new administration should take advantage of this clean slate to work together to build the campus community we want in this “post-COVID” era. Students, be cognizant of the fact that there is a new administration that can and will operate differently than the previous one. Rather than lump them together with the previous administration, take the time to understand their roles and set out to communicate your wants. Take advantage of this transition by reaching out to specific members of the administration to discuss your concerns rather than just stating complaints to your peers; it is through maintaining a direct line of communication that we can have an effective administration. Likewise, it is important for this new administration to make the effort to get to know the student body and all of their concerns and needs. Many hires came from large public state schools like the University of Michigan and Georgia Institute of Technology, with very different environments and cultures than Rice. It is critical that you connect with the campus in order to understand its community. As we navigate through a year of changes, students and administrators alike should make efforts to connect with, share concerns with and learn from each other. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.

My family and I have waited for a decade and a half to be able to say, “I’m an American,” or “Soy Americano.” When my mom received her U.S. citizenship, she couldn’t stop saying that she was American to us while our applications were still being processed. The joy and relief that came over my mom, my dad, and me when we received our Interview and Ceremony letters dissipated years of anxiousness. It indicated the end of our American imposter syndrome. The moment we had our hands on the red, white, and blue piece of paper that welcomed us to the citizenry, no one would be able to call us less than true Americans. No one could tell us to go back to our country because we were already here. However, the financial and personal costs that we endured were a sacrifice for us all. There wasn’t any way around them, yet many other immigrants who feel more American than their own native nationality will never have the chance to be American as a result of these fees. Applications for work visas are $190. Applications for green cards are between $1,200 and $1,750, not including the mandatory medical examination needed for the application. Applications for Naturalization are $725. For amajorityof Harvard students, these costs are inconsequential. But compared to the median immigrant household income, these fees are steep costs that may require months or years of savings, especially for those with dependents. It does not become a matter of who wants to become American, but a matter of who can afford to become American. The ability to afford citizenship, whether it be in the form of time or money, is what a majority of the US population — including Harvard students — are ignorant of. To begin: Having permission to work in the United States as a foreign national — in other words, obtaining the work visa — is tied to your employer. This means if your job is high paying and you have no need to transfer jobs, then you can endure the long, financially intensive process of working towards citizenship. However, for many immigrants, having permission to work tied to your employer means no ability to transfer jobs with better opportunities and being forced to stay at your current job. With many immigrants already having low-paying jobs, the costs of citizenship begin to accumulate, meaning fewer low-income immigrants who want to be citizens can afford it. As of 2021, 26 percent of the US population are immigrants, with the number growing every year. It is imperative for future American leaders and the population to comprehend that we do not become citizens overnight. We don’t become green card holders by chance. Visas are not handed out for free. Ask Naturalized citizens if the arduous process was worth it, and they’ll say yes. Despite the struggles, being a US citizen is a proud achievement. It welcomes me to the greatest country in the world. It welcomes me to the freedom to openly criticize the US — a freedom that is not promised everywhere. And it completes my American dream: one where a Mexican child who always heard of the wonders of America will be able to fully relish and participate in it. I believe every immigrant wanting to become an American citizen should be able to do so free of costs and personal burdens, and I believe that as Americans, we should change our immigration practices to facilitate the process. Being American is one of my proudest accomplishments, and those who share the same passion and vigor to become part of the citizenry should only be limited by their love for their new nation — not by the depths of their pockets.

stanforddaily_2022_114,"Stepping into the Stanford arts scene, one cannot help but marvel at the magnificent scale of the Bing Concert Hall, the immense collections of the Cantor Arts Center, the life-changing performance of the Asian American Theater Project’s fall playAmong the Deador the Stanford Symphony Orchestra’s reverberating chords inPines of Rome. The vast availability of performances and professional venues seem like everything students like I, an art enthusiast coming from a high school of limited scale, could hope for. While I was dazzled by this abundance of opportunities, my desperate hunt for a room to practice flute before my Wind Symphony audition during the first week of school revealed to me the other side of the arts scene at Stanford: the struggle that students face to find a space to further their pursuits individually. I first stumbled upon the music practice rooms in Braun Music Center. Google “music spaces Stanford” and you run acrossBraun 206, the only valid response on the page. Stepping into the glass doors and seeing the little cubicles where cellists struggled to avoid their arms hitting the piano or the wall, I was instantly transported back to boarding school where my love-hate relationship with practice cubicles in the basement of the arts building prompted me to rant in my Common App personal statement, “I hated how the dusty carpet sucked the glow out of my vibrato; I hated how the moldy walls killed the romance of practicing. But at the end of every school day, I was still stuck in ‘the dungeon.’” After waiting 15 minutes for the next available cubicle, I caught myself staring at my sheet music blankly, distracted by the sounds around me. Another flautist in the room at the very end of the hall played running notes more flawlessly than I could ever dream of. The French hornist next door seemed to be also preparing for an ensemble audition, playing a section repeatedly. I played a hopeless middle register A, my sound dry and flat, with all the resonance absorbed by the enclosed, thick walls and lost in the cacophony. I stormed to my audition furious and underprepared. This disparity between the Stanford arts scene and individual practice spaces hardly pertains to musicians alone; I have encountered similar grievances from visual artists or dancers. My dormmates and I, however, are the luckier ones. As members of the first-year Immersion in the Arts: Living in Culture (ITALIC residential program, we have access to two conference rooms, a music room, collaboratorium and dance studio in the basement of Burbank House. The music room, home to a grand piano and drum set, became the favorite spot where we jam out or perfect our solos. I imagine that ITALIC alums return to live here year after year not only for the arts community but also for the practice spaces. Thinking through my living options next year, I, too, face the dilemma of whether to sacrifice my wishes to experience another themed house in order to maintain my access to the Burbank basement. The condition of a working space is directly correlated to the productivity of an artist; this principle hardly needs a New York Times article to explain. More importantly, Stanford’s scarcity of attractive individual practice spaces discourages students from picking up a new instrument or medium. Scrambling to learn the drum set, my friend Sid Zhang ’25 complains of not being able to do so next year after her access to the Burbank basement expires. Until they become advanced enough to have their own studios on campus, my visual artist friends have their art-making opportunities limited to studio classes, which don’t always fit in their schedules. As a university that prides itself on innovation, diversity and a welcoming environment, Stanford should expand students’ access to more attractive individual spaces where experienced artists, musicians, dancers and actors can hone their skills and beginners can improve through perseverance. Until then, Stanford lags behind in providing students with adequate support for their creative pursuits. Yuanlin Linda Liu ‘25 is The Daily s vol. 266 editor-in-chief.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_17,"For a little over a month now, Ukraine has been subject to massive destruction at the hands of the Russian Federation.Homesare being destroyed.Citiesare being bombarded.Childrenare being killed in the hundreds. The Russian invasion is panning out to be Europe’sbiggest crisissince World War II, bringing the biggest food crisis since the 1940s-1950s and one of the largestrefugee crisessince the Syrian Civil War. Despite the war tearing through their homes and cities, many Ukrainians remain vigilant, showing extreme resilience in the face of almost certain danger at the hands of the Russian military. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been on the streets himself, armed with a rifle and ready to defend his country, quite literally an epitome of fighting to the death. Amid this resilience, however, more than 3.7 million Ukrainians havefledtheir homes, accounting for a little over 9% of the total Ukrainian population of 41.1 million. As the civiliandeath tollrises, people havefledto the neighboring countries of Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary and Slovakia. Some have even gone as far asMexico. As refugees arrive at the borders of more and more countries, the difference in treatment between Ukrainian and other refugees is becoming quite clear. Ukrainian refugees are being accepted with open arms by European countries, while refugees from war-torn Middle Eastern countries have consistently been turned away. Why are they being treateddifferentlythan refugees from Syria or Afghanistan? The answer is quite simple: they’re white and European. When the Talibanoverthrewthe government in Afghanistan and re-established their Islamic Emirate last year,millionsof refugees made their way to Europe in hopes of finding a new life free from the cycle of war they had been stuck in for decades, as well as the ensuing oppression likely to come with the return of the Taliban. European nations like the U.K.agreedto take in 25,000 of these refugees, while other nations like Austria, Poland and Switzerland, and the Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Norway and Sweden refused to take any refugees or seemed hesitant to do so; the former trio evenincreasedtheir border security. However, this attitude seems to have changed for Ukrainian refugees. Austria, which refused to take any Afghan refugees, hasregisteredover 27,000 displaced Ukrainians since the war began late in February. Poland has welcomed over2 millionrefugees — greater than the population of the nation’scapital, Warsaw. Switzerland triggered itsspecial “S” statusfor the first time for Ukrainian refugees and is ready to take in nearly 60,000 refugees. They also broke their foreign policy rule of neutrality when they imposed sanctions on Russia in line with the rest of the European Union (EU , although theycontestthis allegation. This is blatant racism. You cannot simply pick and choose which refugees you want to take in and which you don’t. Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkovclaimedthat Ukrainian refugees are “not the refugees Europe is used to,” calling them Europeans and saying “these people are intelligent … educated people …” that the refugees they were “used to” were questionable in regards to their “identity” and that they were “people with unclear paths, who could have been terrorists.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine only highlights what we’ve already known: nobody cares about people in need unless they look like the majority. Ukrainians, Syrians and Afghans alike have faced war, famine, poverty and death on a massive scale. If we are to treat all refugees the same, then why not send Ukrainian refugees back home? It’s what Denmark did with some Syrian refugees, claiming it’s now “safe” for them to go back home and stripping them of their residency, even though the country is still in a state ofcivil war. Of course, it would be inhumane to Ukrainians because they’re white refugees and not “uncivilized terrorist” refugees from the Middle East. This is in no way meant to say that we should treat Ukrainian refugees in the same way Middle Eastern refugees are treated — we shouldn’t. Nobody should be treated that way. These people have faced horrors that nobody in the “first world” will likely experience in their lifetimes. They have been subject to the worst of humanity, and it only makes sense for wealthy countries to attempt to give them refuge. It’s the very least they can do, given that many of these wars have beenstartedby wealthy countries in the first place. Let’s not forget about the war crimes either. There is no doubt that much of what Russia is doing in Ukraine constituteswar crimes. Civilians are beingexecutedin lines on the streets.Mass gravesare appearing in cities for civilians killed by Russian forces. The U.S.Department of Stateand theEuropean Councilhave condemned these actions as war crimes. How is this any different from what the United States and coalition forces have done during wars in the Middle East, which are not classified as war crimes? U.S. forces in Iraq were given extreme freedom in their rules of engagement, allowing them to murder civilians for nearly any reason and without any hesitation. This led to troops “frequently opening fire” at civilians at military checkpoints and during house searches and patrols. The U.S. also hired private security companies to provide security to officials in Iraq, leading to theNisour Squaremassacre, in which contractors from one of these companies killed over a dozen civilians. The contractors werepardonedby former President Donald Trump before he left office in late 2020. The U.S. also made frequent use of drones during its wars in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen. Since January 2004, theBureau of Investigative Journalismhas compiled statistics on U.S. drone strikes, in which it counted over 14,000 confirmed drone strikes, with a total of 910 to 2,200 civilians killed, with 284 to 454 of those being children. This is compared to 8,858 to 16,901 total deaths. While many killed were legitimate targets, the U.S. frequentlydisregardedany possibility of civilian deaths, which clearly constitutes a war crime. Civilian prisoners were alsotorturedby U.S. forces at Abu Ghraib prison during the early years of the Iraq War. Like the refugee stance, this isn’t to say that Russia’s war crimes should be excused because they shouldn’t. But who is the United States to criticize Russia for committing war crimes while at the same time refusing to acknowledge their own? The U.S. often excuses its war crimes as “mistakes” and refuses to join theInternational Criminal Court(ICC since its membership would open it and its servicemembers to prosecution for any war crimes they may commit. Thewar in Ukraineis undoubtedly one of the most pressing issues of our time. The sheer aggression of Russian forces poses a threat to the stability of Europe, as the conflict can easily pour intoneighboring countrieslike Poland. However, the war shows just how easy it is for the West to condemn war crimes and accept refugees, despite their refusal to do so for their war crimes and Middle Eastern refugees. This is a dangerous double standard that should not be tolerated. Mohammad “Moh” Samhouri is a Copy Chief for the 2021-22 school year. He can be reached atsamhourm@uci.edu."
wildcat_arizona_2022_71,"A digital drawing of a graduate holding their cap and diploma. As my senior year of college ends, I find myself reflecting on the past four years and how my life has been defined by this experience. I’ve been influenced in many ways by the University of Arizona. This includes learning about my major and my minor and connecting with individuals along the way. I often pinpoint these specific areas that contribute to my educational journey. Defining moments can stick with you all your life. Some may think college will be a distant memory, though I feel it’s an important accomplishment for me and also for my family. It is nerve-wracking coming to the end of a period of time. An era such as this can essentially help steer you into the decisions you make in the future. I feel as though a lot of my experiences have been outside of my college experiences, but also what I’ve gained through going to a four-year university. I’ve adjusted my sense of belonging to the people I’ve met along the way. There are so many different people with various backgrounds. I’ve often looked through a different lens and found out more about myself through the people I’ve met. People who have had similar challenges, beyond the experience of college or within the institution took my understanding to a different level. Tim Caldwell ofWhitworth Universitysaid, “As I reflected on my life, I began to see a pattern: the times when I had grown the most were when I had struggled or gone through hard things. Difficulty was not something to avoid, but something to embrace.” There are the positive experiences, but there are also hardships while staying in college. The stress of academics, social pressures and the pressures of feeling good enough. I struggled being confident and being the first person in my family to graduate from a four-year university. The defining aptitude of what can be perceived as accomplishment, can be for others such as your family. One of the big challenges was navigating this in a way that didn’t result in placing my whole self worth in making my family proud, but also creating this experience that has made me who I am today. According to Hunter Rawlings from theWashington Post, “ … students need to make a similar commitment to breathe it in and be enlivened by it. They owe this not only to their teachers but also to their parents and themselves. After all, the decision to go to college is a decision to make an investment in their future, an investment of time and money.” I’ve come to learn, while we take in every year into our college experience, along the way, small or big, it comes down to how you ultimately feel about your growth. I’ve been shaped by the many people in my life and I wouldn’t take back my college experience; it’s helped make me into the person I am today.

ubyssey_2022_57,"Sept. 29, 2022 Written byClimate Justice UBC It’s been four years since the Alma Mater Society (AMS voted to divest from fossil fuels. The AMS has acted on the letter of its commitment, but not the spirit — your fees are still being used to trade your future for short-term profit by supporting RBC, Canada’s largestfossil fuelfinancier. RBC, which has a branch in the Nest, is the financer for the loan that paid for the Nest’s construction and manages the majority of the AMS’s multi-million dollar investment portfolio. After years ofstudentcampaigningfrom 2014 to 2018, the AMS formally committed to move its funds out of the oil, gas and pipeline companies that RBC supports — but not to altering its relationship with the bank itself. This means the profit from managing its new ‘fossil-free’ investment portfolio still goes to RBC. If the bank that holds the AMS’s funds readily uses these advantages to invest in the projects that triggeredlast year’s heat dome deaths, AMS Council’s original commitment to divestment seems less and less sincere. Money goes from the wallets of students to fossil fuel emitters and climate crisis enablers. When you pay your student fees each year, one of the payments you make is for the ‘SUB Renewal Fee.’ Each student pays $100, and that money goes directly to the AMS to cover interest payments on the Nest. When your $100 fee arrives at the AMS, it hands the money over to RBC. This is not part of the AMS’s investment portfolio — the money is owed directly to RBC as a result of the AMS’s original loan for the Nest and is not covered by the AMS agreement to avoid direct investment in fossil fuels. This agreement was an explicit acknowledgement of students’common causein rejecting fossil fuel investment, but without the application of constant student pressure the AMS has continued, year after year, to make a bank which supports the companies students rejected into its largest investment partner. When your fees reach the bank as payment, RBC can do whatever it likes with them. As the world’s fifth-largest banking investor in fossil fuels, RBC invests your student fees in theTrans-Mountain Pipelineand other projects like it, jeopardizing the world UBC students will have to live in and flouting UBC s2030 deadlinefor emissions reduction. Despite the line connecting fees collected by the AMS to RBC’s climate failures, AMS Council hasclaimed that advocacy directed at RBC lies outside the society’s mandate. The AMS prefers to focus on“high priority climate-related issues that actually impact students”— ignoring both the threat of the climate crisis that RBC funds and the fact that students are dragged into the matter by the use of their student fees. Rather than seeking out alternatives, like sustainable credit unions for managing its finances, the AMS has deflected responsibility to student groups like Climate Justice UBC, Banking on a Better Future and others, who take on the responsibility of organizing and researching AMS finances, while the society itself benefits from the lack of awareness it has created. For as long as it isn’t clear to UBC students where AMS fees go, the AMS has no need to make a continued effort to make its financial relationships more sustainable. Once students know their funds are being used to bet against a livable future for them, they have the power to hold the AMS accountable. The AMS cannot pretend RBC is a disconnected entity to which it can only advocate change. The bank enjoys its direct financial support and benefits from thegreenwashingeffect of the RBC on campus. The AMS knows this, and proved as much when itdid not renew its contract for RBC’s eHub program.If the AMS is to be taken seriously as an advocate for students, it must proactively look for further opportunities to divest from RBC, rather than ignoring its own commitments and the future of the students it represents. The AMS has done the right thing in the face of student pressure before; it happened in2018, and it can happen in 2022.If you raise your voice, alternatives to banking with RBC can be found and the on-campus outlet will give way to more sustainable alternatives. The AMS is accountable to you, and your fees deserve to fund a future you want to live in.

stanforddaily_2022_64,"Celina Scott-Buechler is a Ph.D. student in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program for Environment & Resources (E-IPER , where she works to bridge climate science and policy. She is also a senior fellow at Data for Progress. Yannai Kashtan is currently a doctoral student in the Earth Systems Science program. He is from Oakland, California. Today marks one week since news of the John Doerr School of Sustainability broke — a new school at Stanford dedicated expressly to sustainability. This was a much-anticipated announcement: for more than a year, students and faculty have eagerly worked alongside administration to envision what a school premised on climate and environmental solution-building might look like. Doerr is Stanford’s first new school in 70 years, and comes as otherpeerinstitutionshave rolled out their own climate schools. Perhaps most impressively, its founding gift of$1.69 billionis the largest in Stanford’s history, andsecond largestfor any institution of higher education in the U.S. In no uncertain terms, this is a critical and long-overdue step in Stanford’s response to climate change. The school is not, however, the golden ticket to climate salvation as many of its proponents would lead us to believe. Its lofty goals, published in adrafttoday, center on instilling students with three core competencies: systems thinking, transdisciplinarity and values thinking. Worthy goals indeed. The process of developing the new school has itself shirked these principles, however. In hisinterviewwith The New York Times, inaugural dean Arun Majumdar is cited saying the new school would work with and accept donations from fossil fuel companies. Accepting money from fossil fuel interests, even those claiming to diversify their portfolios, fundamentally undermines the school’s core learning competencies, tarnishes its academic reputation and hampers itsstated missionof “solving the most complex problems in climate and sustainability.” Despite active student opposition to fossil fuel entanglements, the school’s acquiescence is in many ways unsurprising. Funding academic research is a tried and true industry strategy employed to control and stymie scholarship. Their hope — a well-founded one — is that controlling the ivory tower will in turn allow them to control regulation and political change that threatens their business model. As Bruce Owen and Ronald Braeutigam write in their 1978 book “The Regulation Game: Strategic Use of the Administrative Process”: “Regulatory policy is increasingly made with the participation of experts, especially academics. A regulated firm or industry should be prepared whenever possible to coopt these experts. This is most effectively done by identifying the leading experts in each relevant field and … giving them research grants and the like … I t must not be too blatant, for the experts themselves must not recognize that they have lost their objectivity and freedom of action.” By donating to climate and sustainability research, industry cancontrol which research gets fundedandobtain early access to research directions and results, which gives them time to get ahead of negative press. It alsocasts them as the good guysin the academic and public eye — all the whilechronically underperformingon even the sustainability goals they set for themselves. Indeed, the state of fossil fuel money entanglement with climate research parallels tobacco money entanglement with public health research, except that public health researchers are further along in disentangling their research from industry funds. Four years ago, the deans of 19 public health schoolscollectively signed a statementrefusing tobacco funding, stating “both the tobacco industry and Philip Morris International have a long history of funding ‘research’ in ways meant to purposely confuse the public and advance their own interests, aggressively market cigarettes globally, including to children, and persist in their relentless opposition to evidence based tobacco control interventions.” In a similar act of integrity, last month hundreds of climate and sustainability facultysigned a pledgecommitting to refuse fossil fuel money because they “believe this funding represents an inherent conflict of interest, is antithetical to universities’ core academic and social values, and supports industry greenwashing. Thus, it compromises universities’ basic institutional integrity, academic freedom, and their ability to address the climate emergency.” There is an increasing awareness of the harms of fossil fuel entanglement with climate research and growing numbers of individual faculty are refusing to accept fossil fuel money. Fossil fuel companies have made splashy headlines recently announcing net-zero goals and sustainability targets. If they are willing to change, shouldn’t we collaborate with them, as Dean Majumdar suggests? The Danish company Ørsted is often brought up as an industry poster-child and an implicit argument in favor of industry collaboration. Ørsted began as an oil and gas company, but by 2017 had entirely divested itself of fossil assets and is currently the world’s largest developer of offshore wind power. Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Total, Eni and the other large oil companies from which Stanford has accepted millions are nothing like Ørsted. Whileclaimingto “advance innovative solutions for a lower-emission energy future,” they continue to plow the vast majority of their capital intofossil fuel projects,at odds with the Paris Agreement.Until these companies actually transform themselves into renewable energy companies, their sustainability claimsare not to be trusted. Claiming that accepting fossil fuel money is benign fails to recognize the system of industry influence in which the school is a part. Willingness to partner with companies that for decades have acted in bad faith andused academic partnerships as key tools to greenwashtheir climate-warming and polluting business practices fails to align high-level administrative decisions with the stated values of the school. The most powerful and influential members of the new school should lead by example; if they do not demonstrate systems and values thinking, how are we to expect this of students? In addition to contradicting Doerr’s stated competencies, fossil fuel partnership flies in the face of meaningful student input. Over the past year, the transition team has gestured toward (and in some cases promised outright students having a seat at the table. While at the table, we’ve been clear: the school cannot accept fossil fuel money and still claim to advance climate action. We’ve attended fora, provided written feedback, taken polls. Each time, refusing funding from polluting industries has been one of the mostpopular policy proposals— one that enables the other changes we desperately need in a new school, including a strong emphasis on environmental and climate justice. While the news of the Doerr School of Sustainability is certainly exciting, the value of an institution’s work cannot be extricated from the values upon which it is built. Pledging to accept fossil fuel funding and partner with the very industry that has stalwartly opposed climate action for decades is not only wholly misaligned with the will of students — it promises to feed the same maelstrom of political inaction, mistrust of science and perpetuation of environmental injustice that it claims to counter. A growing coalition of students, faculty, staff and alumni have seen the writing on the wall; we are committed to working with the incoming administration to shape the Doerr School into the “accelerator for progress on the … clean energy future.” The question remains if the Stanford administration — and, yes, the Doerrs themselves — share our commitment. A previous version of this article stated that “last month over 500 climate and sustainability faculty signed a pledge committing to refuse fossil fuel money.” The article has been corrected to say “last month hundreds of climate and sustainability faculty signed a pledge committing to refuse fossil fuel money.” The Daily regrets this error.

ubyssey_2022_6,"Sept. 20, 2022 Written byShane Atienza On September 8, UBC PresidentSanta Onoreleased a statement on the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and all flags on campus were lowered to half mast as the news of the Queen’s death spread. In the late morning, I had learned of the Queen’s passing in Buchanan Tower, and I immediately convened with nearby history professors. “Are you sure you want to go to class?” one said to me, “You look really upset.” While many students went along with their days without a care in the world about this news or shared memes mocking the Queen’s demise, I continued through my day with quiet melancholy. As a Filipino Canadian immigrant, I swore anoathto bear true allegiance to the Queen of Canada and fulfill the duties of citizenship. For more than 15 years, I have been proud to be Canadian and was honoured to have been one of the Queen’s subjects. As a history student specializing in Canadian constitutional and legal history, I appreciated the importance of the Queen and the Crown in Canada’s constitutional system as a foundational element acting as a guardian of our system of responsible government and constitutional conventions. It may seem that I am necessarily a part of a campus minority of loyal Canadian royalists. Indeed, a recentAngus Reid pollshowed that the majority surveyed don’t think the country should continue as a constitutional monarchy, and that countries which formerly had the Queen as their head made the right decision to sever ties with the monarchy. It’s almost a sure thing that such opinions are prevalent at UBC. Oftentimes, people conflate identity with opinion, and assume that those who support the monarchy are old, conservative and predominantly white. In that case, I’d be quite the outlier. But that same poll showed that a greater proportion of Green Party and Liberal Party supporters agreed that Canada should maintain its system of constitutional monarchy (36 and 34 per cent respectively than the only 29 per cent of Conservative Party voters polled. I also know young UBC peers of colour who admired the Queen for her service and also appreciate the Crown’s constitutional role. In the end, it’s hurtful and dangerous to assume people’s views on multifaceted issues based solely on one data point or slice of identity like political preference or ethnicity. On social media, I’ve seen bothinsightfulandmeaningful tributesto Her Majesty and harsh criticism of herlifeandinstitutionfrom UBC community members, and I respect this array of opinions. I also acknowledge thenuanced natureof colonial history/memory and the tragic impacts of colonialism on peoples, past and present, hereat homeandabroad. But I also say this: the Queen was a kind mother, (great grandmother and head of the Commonwealth. She was not a monster who sought ill onto her people. Although the Royal Family as an ancient institution is associated with the horrors of colonial rule that have lasting impacts today, the Queen, in her capacity as a constitutional and not an absolute monarch, had very little to do with the revolting decisions made by colonial governments operating in her name or the name of her ancestors. And, in the end, institutions and symbols can and do change. The multicultural and reconciling Canada of the present is not what it was in its oppressive onset in the nineteenth century, and the imperial empire of yesteryear has undoubtedly evolved into the more modern Commonwealth we have today. That is not to say there is not more work to be done nor that our systems aren’t flawed and that colonialism is a thing of the past (it’s not – it’s here and clear , but that slowly and surely, we have seen change. Whether the rate of change is appropriate is your call, and your calls to action are stirring and welcome. For me, the Queen’s role as sovereign was not merely about symbolism or tradition. It represented a certain humanity and spoke eloquently of the collective spirit that makes us a part of the Commonwealth. She was a bulwark of stability and comfort in trying times – it was hard to not tear up whenthe Queen addressed usin April 2020 in the midst of the pandemic, offering a message of resiliency and hope. She did her duty and kept the promise she made many years ago to dedicate her life to service. And she is now at rest. I put forward this hypothesis: that sentiments of hatred and disgust of the Queen aren’t the only viewpoints floating around on campus. And while I can’t necessarily give you proof that there isn’t only a miniscule handful of people mourning our Queen on UBC’s hallowed intellectual ground, I ask that you consider this possibility. As I awaited the Queen’s funeral, I wore a black mourning band on my arm. Shane Atienza is a senior-year student studying history and French.

state_press_2022_68,"An Arizona State University Police car parked on a pedestrian path on Tempe campus Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2022. Many campus police departments are created for students and police to interact in ways more conducive to student safety, but theASU Police Departmentstill lacks the necessary resources to support student safety beyond policing crime. On-campus police officers are thought to better serve their student communities than local police departments, because they are especially concerned with student safety.This may be the case at some universities, but it is worthwhile to address how ASU can better help students in situations that may not always need to involve ASU PD response. In order to better serve student communities, many campus police departments tend to adopt harm reduction models. Harm reduction models encompass many different types of programs, but some of the ones relevant to student communities involve drug checking, overdose prevention and reversal, psychosocial support and the provision of information on safer drug use, according toHarm Reduction International. In 2019, Tempe initiated a program for police to respond to drug overdoses that integrates social workers, peer counselors from EMPACT and other crisis response professionals. According toPublic Health Post, theTempe First-Responder Opioid Recovery Projecthas yielded promising results, saving 129 lives due to officers administeringnaloxone, a medicine intended to reverse an opioid overdose, as of August 2021. The program also saw 116 survivors and their loved ones be connected to addiction recovery services within the first two years of its initiation. Based on the success of this project, ASU should consider developing a similar response to drug-related emergencies on campus. According to ASU PD spokesperson Adam Wolfe, there is no official policy to connect people to resources in ASU PD s drug response. One policy that ASU could employ is to make overdose prevention kits, which contain medicines like naloxone, easily accessible on campus. This response should also provide mental health services, as it is often related to drug use and overdose. Other than drug response, police responses to mental health crises are also often found ineffective.Mapping Police Violencereported that in 2021, 101 people were killed in the U.S. after police responded to reports of mental health crises or someone behaving erratically. When presented with the dilemma of police being unqualified to respond to mental health crises, harm reductionist models call for easy accessibility to healthcare, social services and treatment. In January 2022, the city ofTempeadopted a new model that dispatches mental health professionals instead of police officers in emergencies involving suicide or self-harm, so long as the person in crisis is unarmed and non-violent, according to a city of Tempe press release. 911 dispatchers work alongsideSolari Crisis and Human Servicesmental health professionals to determine whenCARE 7, Tempe s crisis response unit, should be dispatched. When asked if ASU PD follows a similar model to Tempe PD, Wolfe said police officers are always dispatched first and then decide the proper services needed on scene. If need be, we can send the CARE 7 team as well, Wolfe said. Wolfe also said that earlier this year, ASU PD was focused on minimizing harm in the community and promoting peace through the Police2Peace project. Thepress releasefor the project said the project centers on de-escalation and peace, though it is nothing new for ASU PD. The ASU community would benefit from modifying its current model to first send out mental health specialists when needed, or even more so, by requiring officers being required to attendcross-training sessionswhere they can learn more about things like trauma-informed response, crisis management and de-escalation skills. Maya Swift, a junior studying psychology, said police response may be inappropriate in times of mental health crises. She said the response that comes from an authoritative place is intimidating for many people, which may cause officers to lose connection with (their community . Even being in a police uniform itself, you have a disconnect, Swift said. Swift described how a fellow student she knew was met with a heavy police response after being deemed a danger to himself or others. Swift wonders whether that response was necessary. (Two of our friends did a majority of the de-escalating before the police actually came, she said. I feel like more than the response, the follow-up needs to be better with making sure somebody actually gets connected to the right resources. Sending out behavioral health specialists and providing resources to the person in crisis is more appropriate than sending armed officers. ASU students should not be met with intimidation, especially in times of mental health crises. While Tempe policing has attempted to adopt a more comprehensive policing model, ASU PD still seems to fall short in developing positive relations with students on campus. Prioritizing a harm reductionist model as the primary response for drug and mental health emergencies would significantly benefit the ASU community by creating a more compassionate emergency response.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_40,"As the LGBTQ+ community has grown, the increased popularity of relatively new labels and existing ones has unfortunately resulted in division. The most prominent example of this conflict is between the terms “bisexual” and “pansexual.” Biphobic and transphobic narratives are often presented in discussions regarding the terms’ accurate definitions. Admittedly, it is not an easy topic to comprehend. Being bisexual myself, it took me years to develop my own opinion on the relationship between these two labels. These are what I believe to be the true and false distinctions that have been made between bisexuality and pansexuality. I define a bisexual person as having romantic and/or sexual attraction to people of two or more genders, and a pansexual person as having romantic and/or sexual attraction toward people without any preference of gender identity. The simplest distinction between the two is that being bisexual means that gender impacts attraction, while it does not for a pansexual person. Even in LGBTQ+ spaces, many harmful misconceptions about bisexuality are still prevalent. Pansexuality can be regarded as more inclusive than bisexuality; however, both labels are completely inclusive of transgender and non-binary individuals. Information regarding sexuality is more accessible than ever, which has resulted in a dramatic rise in LGBTQ+ self-identification. In late February 2021,Gallup reported thatabout 5.6% of adults in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ+, including about one in six adults in Gen Z. However, despite sharing some common experiences and constituting a strongDemocratic voting bloc, we are certainly not a unified hivemind. The following passage is from “The Bisexual Manifesto,” a piece published in 1990 through the Bay Area Bi+ & Pan Network: “Do not assume that bisexuality is binary or duogamous in nature: that we have ‘two’ sides or that we must be involved simultaneously with both genders to be fulfilled human beings. In fact, don’t assume that there are only two genders.” Additionally, the false idea that bisexuality excludes attraction to transgender people is rooted in transphobia. Transgender people do not fall on a different gender spectrum than anyone else, and so they are not excluded from any sexuality’s boundaries of attraction. Anyone who experiences romantic or sexual attraction and says that they would never be attracted to a transgender person under any circumstance is simply transphobic. Evidently, the bisexual community has been fighting against these common stereotypes, and in favor of inclusion for all, for a long time. To be clear, parts of “The Bisexual Manifesto” can apply to any label in the bisexual umbrella. Individuals that identify with any such label are not more promiscuous than anyone else. Similar but different labels such as omnisexual and polysexual are valid as well. Some argue that too many new terms have come into relevance, which has undermined the push towards acceptance by proposing too many identities to accept. This expansion of what falls under the LGBTQ+ umbrella, or broader terms like “queer,” may be confusing, but no less valid. Ultimately, the semantics of these labels are not as important as what the individual feels most comfortable identifying with. No one has any right to criticize how somebody chooses to define themselves because it is completely their decision to make, and no label is indicative of any negative traits. I have done a lot of research to develop a deep understanding of the LGBTQ+ community that exists today. I do not expect anyone else to do the same, but it is each person’s responsibility to at least educate themselves at a basic level. If nothing else, understand that we are still people; however, we have a different sexuality and relationship to gender than most. Bias can be ingrained into everybody, and it takes a conscious effort to remove. We cannot reasonably expect everyone to understand the nuances of each label, but we can demand that each member of our community is respected.

wildcat_arizona_2022_26,"An image of climate protesters standing on a burning world by Farrah Rodriguez. Political activism comes in many different forms. It can be violent, gentle or even a bit bizarre. However, activism in the climate space has taken on a new form as of late, with advocates protesting the lack of action on the subject of climate change by defacing historical art pieces. The attack on art is a relatively new phenomenon in the world of climate protesting, with activists making headlines by throwingsoupat a Van Gogh painting,gluingone’s head to the frame of a Vermeer painting and vandalizing a classic Monet withmashed potatoes. This type of activism has many people talking. It’s new, it’s radical and if nothing else, it’s certainly interesting. But is it effective? As a purveyor of weird drama, I’m inclined to say yes, but I spoke with a few climate activists from the University of Arizona to get their take on the issue. In a conversation with the co-directors for Students for Sustainability, a student-run organization that promotes sustainability on the UA campus, Co-Director Samantha Wallace discussed her frustration with the food protests and their effects of obscuring the real directive: to raise awareness about climate change as a whole. Wallace said about the mashed potato protest, “now a lot of the dialogue is about whether or not they should or should not have thrown the mashed potatoes at the painting, which kind of distracts from the real issue.” This sentiment is not only shared by Wallace. Nicole Collins, waste-reduction chair for Students for Sustainability, mentioned that radical activism such as this won’t change climate policy overnight. “Understanding that it takes time to do a lot of the things we want to do is important for not getting super frustrated by administration or people in the University not working with us immediately,” Collins said. Yet, what we have seen so far in the realm of climate activism just hasn’t worked. Despite worldwide interest in climate change activism surging after climate poster child Greta Thunberg’sspeechat the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, not much has changed in the world of climate policy (although bonus points to the U.S. for the passing of theInflation Reduction Actrecently . Meeting the goals the Paris Climate Agreement set out — that is, limiting global temperature rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius — is still along way off. This is unfortunately not surprising, but disheartening all the same. Climate activists have worked nonstop to advance their goal of making somebody, or anybody, listen and act. Arizona Divest, an on-campus organization working with the university tolessen UA’s enormous investment in fossil fuels, had a rally on Sept. 23 to make their voices heard. According to Ellie Standifer, community outreach co-chair and secretary for UAZ Divest, the hardest part about climate activism is engagement; in a conversation about the effectiveness of climate protesting, she told me that “you can’t make somebody care.” Perhaps a more cynical viewpoint on the nature of climate activism, but Standifer’s point is an important one on the topic of climate activism. Advocates for change may host all the rallies in the world, but they will go nowhere if there is a lack of interest. RELATED:OPINION: The Inflation Reduction Act is a big win, but we can still do more So how do you ignite an interest in climate activism in a community? The answer might just be radical activism. Hurling food at historical art pieces is likely not the first form of protesting you think of when it comes to radical activism, but it begins a conversation that encourages anyone and everyone to get involved, which may help rally a community together to fight for something bigger. In our conversation, Standifer underscored the community aspect of climate change. “One of the really important parts of climate protests is that it shifts the narrative from climate action being an individual initiative to being a collective initiative,” Standifer said. Community movements can inspire change, from college clubs advocating for climate action from their university to defacing art pieces for the sake of conversation. Climate activism, even in its weirdest form, is still worth pursuing because awareness leads to action, and action leads to change. The world can’t wait anymore for us to save it, and if that saving comes in the form of tomato soup, then so be it.

stanforddaily_2022_33,"American Indians, Alaskan Natives (AI/AN , and Indigenous communities have long demanded to have visibility within the healthcare system and equitable access to care. Preventable problems cause a disproportionateburden of diseasesfor these communities and disadvantage them in comparison to other Americans. One preventable problem is the lack of diversity within the healthcare space. There is little AI/AN/Indigenous representation across all healthcare professions, which contributes tohealth disparities in these communities. According to a 2018 AMA Council on Medical Educationreport, out of an estimated 5.2 million AI/AN/Indigenous individuals in the US, only less than half of a percent are in the physician workforce. Studies show that patientoutcomesandsatisfactionimprove when patients receive care from healthcare professionals from similar backgrounds. Also, minority physicians are often more likely to work in underservedregions. These healthcare professionals can provide more culturally concordant care to underserved patient populations, often in their own languages. How can we take steps toward health equity for AI/AN/Indigenous communities? Efforts in this direction require all leading medical institutions to play a critical role in recruiting and nurturing AI/AN/Indigenous medical professionals. Namely, Stanford University School of Medicine must empower and equip developing healthcare professionals to achieve their career dreams and expand healthcare access in their communities. To help address this crucial need for better Native healthcare, organizations are taking measures into their own hands. For example, the Association of American Indian Physicians (AAIP hosts the American Indians Accessing Health Professions Program (AIAHPP each year. This conference aims to increase AI/AN/Indigenous students’ awareness of healthcare professions and aid AAIP’smission: “to pursue excellence in Native American health care by promoting education in the medical disciplines, honoring traditional healing principles, and restoring the balance of mind, body, and spirit.” Stanford Medicine joined forces with AAIP to host the7th annual AIAHPP in-person conference. Spearheaded by Mark Gutierrez, the Director of the Office of Diversity in Medical Education, the in-person conference served a group of AI/AN/Indigenous identifying students interested in pursuing careers in healthcare. The conference began on a powerful note: an opening blessing, song, and land acknowledgment from Ohlone tribal membersDesiree Munoz and Carla Marie(Costanoan Rumsen Carmel Tribe . When supporting AI/AN/Indigenous communities, it is undoubtedly essential to first listen to and experience the lived AI/AN/Indigenous historical narratives. The students also heard from leaders in various healthcare professional fields and gained an appreciation for their different perspectives. During the three-day experience, students heard from faculty such as current and former AAIP president Dr. Luke Day, MD (Oglala Lakota nation , and Dr. Nicole Stern, MD, MPH, FACS (Mescalero Apache , respectively. Notably, students heard from a panel of Native American faculty and physicians describing their personal and career journeys as Native individuals. Conference activities like this panel were a powerful force to breathe a sense of belonging into these developing healthcare professionals. As attendee Desirae Barragan (Gabrieleno Band of Mission Indians of Southern California said, “I have never been surrounded by so many Native American Physicians, medical students, and pre-med students, in one space, the future of medicine will be undoubtedly Indigenous.” Associate dean of diversity in medical education at Stanford Medicine, Dr. Reena Thomas, best exemplified the theme of belonging with an opening exercise for attendees. She encouraged them to close their eyes and “envision themselves as future medical students in Stanford’s lecture halls.” This is the vision we have for AI/AN/Indigenous students pursuing a career in healthcare: a right to belong. The conference received overwhelmingly positive feedback from students. For example, Lauren Reyes (Diné and Mescalero Apache said, “the AIAHPP Conference provided us with a strong network of passionate Native health professionals and the resources we need to pursue health careers. Being surrounded by people who are driven to serve our communities gave me a sense of belonging and encouragement in pursuing medicine.” Having these students believe they can be the next face of healthcare professionals should empower Stanford and other medical institutions to expand their efforts in this direction. Much work lies ahead in reshaping and rekindling Native healthcare. The AIAHPP conference shows that medical schools everywhere need to better recruit and admit more AI/AN/Indigenous students to their various programs. For reference, of the 22,647 students who matriculated into medical schools from2021-2022, only 164 students identified purely with AI/AN or in combination with other races/ethnicities. This statistic alone should push Stanford Medicine to be a powerful voice in this Native health crisis. Stanford needs to provide more resources for Native healthcare professionals and be a model for institutions around the world. More awareness and action from Stanford can only aid better visibility and accessibility within healthcare for AI/AN/Indigenous communities. With these steps, we will get closer to achieving health equity for these communities and create meaningful opportunities for them to belong in the space of health care.

crimson_2022_18,"In today’s Nairobi, streets that were once named after British colonizers now feature the names of Kenyan freedom fighters and Pan-African leaders. The state house, which used to be the official residence of the governor of British East Africa, is now the home of the president of Kenya. The iconic Kipande House — which, during colonial times, was where Kenyans applied for identification cards that permitted them gainful employment and the right to travel — now hosts one of the largest commercial banks. Such is the contradiction, or perhaps harmony, that describes postcolonial Nairobi. What was once a place of cool waters — “enkare nyrobi” — has evolved from what it was before and after British colonization. Nairobi is a beautiful microcosm of different cultures, old and new, modern and traditional. Our language of choice is Sheng – Swahili, punctuated with English and elements of Gikuyu, Kamba, Dholuo, and Luhya. The complexities of Nairobi represent contemporary Kenyan identity. But, close to 60 years after independence, Kenya still grapples with the effects of colonialism. There is no shortage of colonial ideology and attitudes present in our land, from our education system to the values we espouse. The colonists did not just come, plunder, and leave. In their wake, they left the stench of colonization that we still bear today. From a very young age, the idea of Western superiority is imprinted onto our minds — we are taught to hate the things in us that are African. In schools, we are often asked to shave our heads because our African hair is “unsightly.” We are forced to acknowledge the apparent good that came with colonialism and are told that we ought to be grateful to the British for “civilizing” us. Mastery of the English language is often treated as a measure of intelligence. We constantly try to differentiate ourselves from our Africanness and seek approval from those who, against our better judgment, we perceive to be better than us. This, perhaps, has been at the root of many of our problems. While there are problems in Kenya that are of our own making, I do believe that the colonists were — and still are — the architects of many of our misfortunes. Along with the bad taste of colonization left in our mouths, Kenyan youth and African youth at large must wrestle with how to curate a postcolonial African identity — an identity we can call our own. There is an understanding that the pre-colonial identities we once adorned and cherished are long gone. Kenyan life before British intervention has been almost entirely erased, so while we can try to retrace it, we can only recover part. However, even with the little we can recover, we can still redefine what it is to be African. The path forward for many African countries must be to find how traditions and cultures that had been erased fit in the world we live in now — the world that was imposed onto us by colonizers. Therefore, we must actively debate, fix, unlearn, adjust and create new cultures together. We must understand that development for us will look very different from having endless skyscrapers, building powerful manufacturing industries, or beating the dollar, as is the common vision in Western nations. Development for Kenya may take the form of sustainable agriculture, which has been shown to enhance economic growth while reducing carbon emissions. Our development may be stimulated by Africa’s abundance of renewable energy sources. Or it may come from technological innovations that suit the particular needs of Kenyans. Such unique trajectories of development constitute the complexity of Kenya and should not be stunted by repressive Western ideals of progress. The rest of the world, however, doesn’t seem to envision this complexity, or simply chooses to ignore it. The true Africa contradicts the Africa that the rest of the world, particularly the West, wants to see. The world wants an Africa that is free of modernization. An Africa with purely “traditional” cultures that are untouched and remain static for the world to appreciate with ease – a cultural museum of sorts. A Taylor Swift’s “Wildest Dream”-esque Africa, one with beautiful lush savannahs and bright orange sunsets but without Africans in it. The world wants an Africa that is riddled with problems, impoverished and unable to help itself, constantly in need of relief and salvation. The world wants to see an Africa where oppression is all there is, where democracy doesn’t exist, where no one has rights: an Africa to demonize in order to uplift Western civilization. At Harvard, and in academia at large, such a retrograde understanding of African identity permeates discourse on Africa. People engage with African identity by flattening it out to simplicities. From class conversations to political debates, there seems to be very little appreciation of the complexities of African culture and identity. This shouldn’t be the case. The Africa the rest of the world fantasizes about is not the Africa that exists in reality. Africa is evolving on its own path, and it is high time the rest of the world contends with this.

wildcat_arizona_2022_30,"Since I was 13, I have struggled with hormonal and cystic acne; now, at 19, I am still suffering. I hated my face during high school and was deeply ashamed of having people see me. I used makeup to hide the acne, but it did not work. I have gone to dermatologists and other doctors, and nothing they have prescribed has been effective. Coming to college, I have found myself and have been less insecure because I feel less judged. I grew up in the same town for most of my life, so everyone knew everything about everyone. My peers knew I had acne and couldn’t cure it, and I felt like they were judging my face. Wearing a mask during COVID-19 helped me become less ashamed of my acne because most of my acne is on my cheeks, which are covered when I wear a mask. I was able to stop being scared of what people thought of my acne and started living my life like I wanted to. RELATED:OPINION: The perils of unregulated skincare Acne is nothing to be ashamed of. Almost80%of people between the ages of 11 and 30 will suffer acne breakouts. Since we are in the age of Facetune and filters, it is overwhelming to see people with seemingly perfect skin, and it is easy to become less confident when it seems like no one else is suffering from breakouts. Celebrities seem to have clear skin and never suffer from breakouts, but stars likeKendall Jennerhave spoken about their acne-prone skin. It is hard not to compare yourself to those on social media, but it is something one must learn to do; so many apps contort people’s faces and blur blemishes that people do not see when they see the final product. Acne can also negatively impact one’s mental health. Having acne has beenlinkedto decreased self-esteem, anxiety and depression. Acne can cause bullying among peers, which causes self-esteem to plummet. Acne is mainly seen between ages 11 and 30 due toandrogen hormones, which help start puberty and peak during the teenage years. It is often a misconception that acne will disappear as soon as somebody graduates high school, and around15%of adult women struggle with acne. Acne makes people feel alone, but nearly everyone has struggled with acne. Seeing celebrities and people in movies and books with acne made me feel I was not going through the struggles of acne alone, and seeing others go through the same issues made it easier to live with. Acne is very common, and one should not feel ashamed of it because one can think that no one else suffers from it. It does not make someone less attractive or less of a person if they have it.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_56,"Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ retweeteda video on his Twitter account, showcasing an edited version of the opening credits from the anime Attack on Titan. The video depicted him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY and swinging two swords at President Biden on Nov. 8. Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA and Lauren Boebert (R-CO also appear beside Gosar, implying that his allies would support a violent proclamation of their ideals through oppressing their colleagues. This depiction of murder of a U.S. Representative and a violent attack on the sitting president prompted backlash from the public, and indicated to Gosar’s colleagues that he had no respect for them — especially if he was willing to publicly share such a violent video. On November 17, as a result of the public’s disappointment and subsequent calls for the suspension of Gosar’s social media accounts, the Housereprimandedhim with a censure and removed him from his committee assignments, which saw him removed from his positions on the Committees on Natural Resources and Oversight and Government Reform. However, the idea of a censure has no other punitive measures for the member upon which it has been sanctioned. Since it relies on the public reaction and personal desire to make amendments, it cannot be guaranteed to incite a truly effective way of reprimanding someone. The House resolution that was voted upon included clauses not only about his support for violence against women, as demonstrated by the video he retweeted, but also about how such portrayals of violence from an elected officials can inspire their followers and endanger the safety of their peers. Greene, an ally of Gosar, had alsobeen censuredin February, after her support for multiple conspiracy theories and sharing of extremist posts on her social media accounts. Her misuse of a public platform to support baseless theories and encourage stereotypes and hate-based speech was also met with backlash. Her defense sounded eerily similar to the manner in which Gosar attempted to defend his instigation of indirect violence through his posts. Just like Greene, Gosar tried to defend his provocative posts with the justification of humor and that his actions were never publicly condemned by the GOP. These forms of hateful rhetoric are not limited to the United States. They have beenobserved in multiple countries, and have been proven to correlate with a direct increase in domestic terrorism and the number of hate crimes in a region. The polarization of politics creates a stark contrast between the traditionalists and the progressives in any given government, and this division is prominent in the American governmental structure. Within the vote to censure Gosar, two Republicans voted with the Democrats against him — making the vote the narrowest margin in history for the censure of a House Representative. This implies division within the parties as well as within the mentalities of those that create the formative policies of the country. If they cannot agree upon the necessity of respect for one another despite a difference in political viewpoints, how do they expect the population to come together to enforce cohesive laws? Especially after the nation has faced the worst tragedies in the wake of the never-ending pandemic? Facing the importance of maintaining one’s humanity in times of confusion should be a priority for lawmakers — not fueling the flames of the fire of division that have already been growing at a concerning rate. Such incidents also bring into question the legitimacy of electing inexperienced politicians. Those that have most popularly denoted the effects of the use ofviolent rhetorichave not faced nearly enough punishments equivalent to the damage they caused, or have the potential to cause. Many elected officials later show how their lack of political knowledge or governmental experience affects the methods through which they appeal to their supporters and present themselves to the public. For example, Gosar used to be a dentist with a successful practice — his switch to the political arena highlighted his lack of exposure to the policy-making world, and showed that he did not know how to approach the relational aspect of his work. Similarly, former president Donald Trump — a former businessman — and Greene — a failed businesswoman and Q-Anon conspiracy theorist — were uninvolved in even local politics before seeking election. They are to be blamed for the manipulative rhetoric tactics utilized by them in order to gain a voter base that believes the same baseless ideas as them. Such baseless tactics were also employed by Gosar to attempt to defend himself against the claims regarding his incitation and support of political violence against other representatives. His spokespersonstatedthat the left failed to understand “meme culture,” and that his intentions with sharing the video were not violent, and according to Gosarhimself, he meant to use the video as a way to symbolically represent his fight against the immigration policy supported by the Democrats. If these misinterpretations of his so-called “non-violent” intentions behind posting the video are the main perspective of Gosar and his supporters, then no form of censure and punishment other than expulsion from Congress is enough. Any other workplace would immediately terminate an employee that directly or indirectly threatens to kill or support violence against their colleagues. Why should Gosar get a free pass? The house isempoweredto expel any member that exhibits “disorderly behavior.” Gosar’s misuse of his platform and extremist ideals are leaps beyond what the socially acceptable behavior standard is. His own sister believes that no one holds himaccountable. While public figures receive such threats on a common basis, something from their own colleagues present a real danger of apprehension to them, indicating that he should be investigated for any other such support of violence, and even be questioned for instigating forms ofassault. Such actions by any other individual would prompt the involvement of law enforcement, showing how the system in place for reprimanding politicians is clearly weak — and unless real outrage is presented against them, there may be no real change to the way punitive measures are agreed upon and implemented. When people ask about the kind of harm an animated video can present; this is the example that needs to be shown. Violence doesn’t just mean physical harm — it means the potential to harm, and any mindset that puts humanity and basic morals at risk. Nandini Sharma is an Opinion Staff Writer.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2022_5,"NASA and SpaceXlaunched the first all-private space crew, Axiom-1, on April 8. The team includedthree wealthy businessmenand one astronaut. Whilst this marks one small step for the future of commercial space travel, it could also mark one giant leap backward for mankind. In the Oscar-nominated Netflix film, “Don’t Look Up,” a comet heads towards Earth and is set to destroy humanity. When billionaire CEO Peter Isherwell discovers that the raw materials of the comet are worth trillions of dollars, he calls off the launch meant to destroy the comet. When Isherwell’s own attempt to destroy the comet fails, he and a handful of global elites board a spaceship in hopes of fleeing Earth and finding life on another planet. While humorously dark and satirical, the story of Isherwell’s character is not entirely dissimilar from the numerous billionaires hoping to tap into the lucrative commercial venture of space. In 2019, NASA was called upon toexpand commercial modulesonboard the International Space Station (ISS , as it was recently announced that the station isexpected to retire in 2031. In offloading these human space missions to private companies, NASA hopes that theincreased competitionbetween private companies will accelerate the time we reach commercial space travel. “We’re taking commercial business off the face of the Earth and putting it up in Space,” NASA administratorBill Nelsonsaid before the Axiom-1 launch on Friday. This ambition for future space travel draws into question “who” will be able to go. The three billionaires who boarded Axiom-1 — Larry Connor, Mark Pathy and Eyten Stibbe — each paid a sum of$55 million. While they are up there toconduct research during their stay in the ISS, this money could have also been used to fund important and life-saving research on Earth. Dr. Wendy Whitman Cobb, an Air Force political scientist for space argues that the privatization of space is for the better, stating that it enables NASA topursue future projectslike starting moon or Mars colonies and exploring deeper space. “The more ‘normal’ people we see fly into space, more of the public will see this as possible and be excited by it,” Cobb said in an interview with the New York Times. Yet, with Elon Musk valuing space travel at between$100,000-$500,000, it is hard to see that so-called “normal people” will ever be able to afford this luxury experience. In an interview with TED Creator Chris Anderson, Musk proposed that space travel can be affordable for anyone if people are willing to“work and save up”for it. “If moving to Mars costs, for argument’s sake, $100,000, then I think almost anyone can work and save up and eventually have $100,000 and be able to go to Mars if they want,” Musk said. With the median income in the United States standing at $67,521in the 2020 census, the CEO of SpaceX has underestimated the difficulty of saving $100,000, let alone for people in developing nations. Perhaps the future of commercial space travel appears more like a luxury hobby for the elite millionaires of the world rather than a goal for the average person. Somehow, we are reminded of that in the final scene in “Don’t Look Up” where Isherwell and his high society associates flee a dying planet. “Don’t Look Up” is an allegory for climate change and our lack of action to prevent it. If space travel becomes commercialized, the emissions produced by rockets will significantly contribute to making climate change irreversible. It is estimated that the emissions per passenger will be around 100timesthat of a long-haul flight. For some scientists, this is a worrying statistic considering some companies’ ambitions to fly tourists to spaceseveral times a day. Without finding a means of eliminating the carbon footprint of rockets, they are as much of a vehicle for finding new life in space as they are for destroying life on Earth. The emissions produced by rockets also affect the Earth’s atmosphere in a way that no other carbon-fuelled technologies might. The use of kerosene to power rockets produces a significant amount of soot, a type of black carbon emission. When this is released into the middle and upper atmospheres, the soot has a warming effect500 timesgreater than when it is closer to the Earth’s surface. This is because there are few clouds competing with the soot to absorb the sun’s rays. If rocket launches start to become far more frequent in the future, the effect of these emissions could substantiallyhinder the Earth’s ability to repair its ozone layer. With the move towards commercialized space travel accelerating, so is the speed of global warming. Private companies like SpaceX mustconduct further researchto assess the ecological impact of their rockets before further expanding their commercial space flights. Whilst the thought of flights to space remains an exciting prospect, the affordability and environmental effects of commercialized space travel should be kept firmly on the minds of the billionaires looking to invest.

ubyssey_2022_16,"July 18, 2022 Written byDaniel Sax In March, theAMS passed a motiondirecting UBC and the Board of Governors to divest from nine companies complicit in the violation of Palestinian human rights. UBC-invested companies, includingLockheed MartinandCaterpillar, contribute to illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, construct weapons of war and commit other crimes. With 7 abstentions, the motion passed 20 to 2. In addition, the motion called for the AMS to release astatement condemning the Israeli state s system of apartheid and occupation of Palestine. As councillors submitted their final votes on the motion, I sat silent, my hands joined with fellow organizers and friends. Four hours of debate had left us exhausted, but the room was electric — as the news of our majority victory rippled through the crowd of students in attendance, all was elation and celebration. That evening, students, organizers and AMS councillors united in a vision for a better UBC — one willing to take a stand against oppression, occupation and apartheid. I joined the Divestment Coalition as a representative of the Independent Jewish Voices (IJV Vancouver Youth Bloc. Working alongside more than 20 organizations and student groups, I had the opportunity to share my perspective as a member of the anti-Zionist Jewish community and speak to the multiplicity of Jewish voices that oppose the Israeli state’s system of apartheid and occupation of Palestine. My role is important because much of the opposition to the divestment motion was grounded in the claim that the asks being made by the Coalition of the AMS and Board of Governors were antisemitic. Holding the State of Israel accountable for its crimes against Palestinians is a far cry from antisemitism. It is a foundational step for UBC and the AMS to demonstrate its commitment to and support for Palestinian students, anti-racism on campus and global human rights. There is no singular Jewish voice — claims of antisemitism cannot be used to justify or disguise the crimes of the Israeli state or silence the lived experiences of Palestinians at UBC or globally. Supporting divestment means naming and condemning the crimes of the Israeli state, not casting judgment on Israeli and Jewish people. In passing the divestment motion, the UBC AMS joins agrowing listof universitiesacross Canada taking similar stances in opposition to Israeli apartheid and occupation. Unfortunately, it has also become one of many student associations to face resistance from university administrations. In April, President and Vice-Chancellor Santa Ono released astatementdeclaring that UBC willnot support the AMS divestment motionon the grounds that it did not emerge from “constructive and respectful debate” and is not representative of “academic freedom and freedom of expression.” Much is problematic about this statement, but of paramount concern is President Ono’s use of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion rhetoric to reinforce systemic racism at UBC and homogenize Jewish voices on campus. UBC does not exist in a political vacuum, but President Ono’s statement suggests that it is possible to leave power dynamics at the door when fighting for Palestinian human rights. This is a misguided message. It is unfair to expect Palestinian students at UBC to continually outline and explain the Israeli state’s system of apartheid to those who deny the existence of it. President Ono’s decision to maintain the status quo in the name of academic freedom is just as political a statement as divestment. By not supporting student-led divestment motions, UBC denies the lived experiences of Palestinians and continues to make campus a hostile place for Palestinian students. Moreover, at no point during the divestment motion’s conception or progression through student government were Israeli or Jewish students attacked for their identities. Emphasis was consistently placed on the companies from which UBC was to divest and the Israeli state’s internationally recognized criminal activity. President Ono is claiming otherwise, conflating Jewishness with Israel and, by extension, suggesting that all Jewish students support and condone the violence, oppression and apartheid enacted by Israel. This, evidently, is untrue and suggesting as much enforces a narrative that Jewish people are of a singular mind — an antisemitic sentiment itself. In a few weeks’ time, I, alongside a delegation of anti-Zionist Jewish UBC students and community members through IJV, will meet with President Ono and Associate Vice President, Equity and Inclusion, Arig al Shaibah to discuss our concerns and ways forward. It is my sincere hope that we will be able to address the harms perpetuated through UBC’s reaction to the divestment motion and reiterate that Jewish voices are diverse and cannot be treated as a monolith. The fight for divestment at UBC is far from over, but I am motivated by the knowledge that the weight of student opinion is firmly behind justice.

rice_thresher_2022_6,"ByThresher Editorial Board11/2/22 12:00am Rice faculty must include a mental health statement in their syllabi going forward after the faculty senate adopted part of a Student Association recommendation Sept. 28. Specifically, professors must include a list of mental health resources on campus compiled by the Wellbeing and Counseling Center and encourage students to use them as necessary. We applaud the faculty senate’s actions as a step in the right direction, but it is truly the bare minimum that they could have done to address students’ mental health. The original SAresolutionincluded three recommendations, two of which were adopted by the faculty senate. The one that wasn’t adopted called for establishing “academic adjustments for academic-related mental health concerns, such as extensions and attendance.”Minutesfrom the faculty senate debate on the resolution describe concerns over how to standardize accommodations for mental health issues and professors’ inability to differentiate between “normal stress and something else.” We wholeheartedly agree with these concerns, and we know that resolving them will require much more discussion among faculty, students and the Wellbeing and Counseling Center about how professors should approach mental health accommodations. But the existence of concerns cannot and should not dissuade faculty from beginning to offer accommodations now. Professors are constantly experimenting with their syllabi: They’ll try teaching a new book or assigning a new project in the hopes that it will improve learning outcomes for students. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t, but at least they have tried something. We do not see why introducing meaningful mental health accommodations is any different. Faculty at Rice have the immense power to create an open and inclusive environment for discussing academic-related mental health with students. Just being transparent on the first day of classes about the academic accommodations they offer — whatever they may be — can reduce the stigma around students asking for accommodations. We are sure that requiring professors to speak about the existence of their mental health accommodations in some form, even just indicating a willingness to discuss them on an individual basis, will do wonders for student appreciation. Anyone who hasread the Thresherover the past few years knows thatmany studentson this campusstruggle with mental health issuesto varying degrees throughout their time at Rice. The faculty senate clearly views this as an issue to be addressed — they adopted a resolution trying to do just that. But their resolution is just words on a page that falls short of any real action. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2022_25,"The term “polarization” has become a buzz word in much the same capacity as “fake news,” “wokeness” and “border security.” I’ve heard the phrase “American politics is so polarized” repeated at almost every talk, discussion or forum tangentially related to politics. Whatexactlydo we mean when we say “polarization?” I would argue that we, as a society and as a university, are plagued by a very specific type of polarization — one that is driven by visceral emotions rather than ideological differences. I grew up in a small town on the east coast of New Zealand, where politics didn’t occupy people’s daily lives. I don’t remember ever witnessing or engaging in a “heated” political discussion. From watching news coverage of Trump’s presidency, I suspected that I was in for a cultural shock when I arrived at Stanford last winter. My first weeks at Stanford were ordinary enough; I didn’t witness any political antagonism. I was convinced that Big Media once again sensationalized reality. Then, Mike Pence came to Stanford. And along came the circus. The Stanford College Republicans (SCR eventtook place in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last February. Provocatively titled “How to Save America from the Woke Left,” the event was twice (unrightfully denied funding by the Undergraduate Senate, before finally being approved by the Constitutional Council. I remember cringing throughout the event at the pettiness both sides displayed. From the “dunking on the Woke Left” intro and montage of Biden’s gaffes, to the disruptive heckling and trolling questions. The scene reminded me of Call of Duty game chats, where terms like “n00b,” “rkt” and “owned” are thrown around. Politics — a vital element of American society, so I’ve been told — appeared juvenile and shallow. Through a course on Deliberative Democracy, I have come to learn that what I’d witnessed was the manifestation of “affective polarization,” the tendency to antagonize individuals of rival political groups while favoring those of one’s own group. It is the gap between how much you like the people of your political group and how much you dislike the people of opposing political groups. “Ideological polarization,” on the other hand, is the difference betweenactualpolitical opinions of different individuals. Aside from the overtly partisan antagonism between SCR and the rest of Stanford, I have seen affective polarization permeate every aspect of campus life during my time at here. Within dorms, non-progressive students are alienated because of their political beliefs. In classrooms, students avoid “trying on new ideas” in fear that they will be irreversibly bound to their words and placed in an “-ist” bucket.A progressive student I spoke to recently said that they fear their view on policing — specifically, that we should not abolish the police but reform it — would be seen as not progressiveenoughto their peers. Affective polarization extends even into extracurricular activities. A sophomore revealed to me that there is a general sentiment within their dance team to not bring on people who have unpopular political views, fearing it would “affect the family dynamic.” They explained that anyone on the team has a no-questions-asked veto during the selection process, which could be used to prevent political “others” from joining the team. As a participant and an observer, I see three primary causes to the deepening affective polarization on campus, with the first being “social balkanization.” Stanford does a great job fostering diversity through admissions; however, members of this diverse student body nonetheless gravitate towards like-minded people. This reduces the amount of diverse interactions students have, as echo chambers form within dorms and across campus. These self-sorted social groups of like-minded people naturally generate ingroup/outgroup dynamics, increasing affective preference for ingroup members. Second, students desperately lack the necessary skills and practice needed to discuss contentious issues. To put it crudely, students don’t know how to disagree. This causes the frequent occurrence of poor-quality political discussions that make people walk away feeling hurt, antagonized or unheard. As a result, stronger animosity develops between disagreeing individuals, further amplifying social sorting and exacerbating affective polarization. In my experience, facilitated classroom discussions about politics have marginally better outcomes — which brings us to the final issue of class format. Sections, which should be intended for discussions, are instead reiterations of lectures. I’ve seen and heard that many instructors of general education courses like COLLEGE and SLE try to push students, who possess a diverse range of views, towards consensus, rather than allowing for disagreement. By forcing students to agree before they are truly persuaded, instructors turn class discussions into mere performative exercises, dissuading students from undertaking genuine attempts at understanding their classmates’ views. This reinforces students’ convictions in their pre-existing views, strengthening ingroup bonds while amplifying the differences (real or perceived between groups. I do believe in the notion that universities are microcosms of society; thus, I think if left unattended, affective polarization will wreak greater havoc on the already precarious social and political spheres of American life in the coming years. This is why I want to draw attention to theprecisenature of the problem confronting us. If we fall deeper into our ideological silos and the animosity between political groups grows, then our vision of a truly inclusive future will come under threat. The situation does seem dire, and we are pressed for effective solutions. I hope to elucidate some ways to alleviate affective polarization in my future articles.

ASU and the Arizona Coyotes have reached a deal allowing theCoyotes touse ASU s new multipurpose arena, for at leastthe next three seasons, as they look for a new home. This agreement, however short, greatly benefits ASU. Currently, the ASU men s hockey team plays atOceanside Arena,which holds just 747 seats for hockey games. ASU has been building and constructing a new multipurpose arena in Tempe to hold 5,000 fans. This new deal, conducted by the University and the Coyotes, greatly benefits the school rather than drawing it back, and theCoyoteswill have the ASU arena set up toNHLstandards. ASU will be able to hold more events, which results in more revenue for the school, said Kenny McGinley, president of Arizona High School Hockey Association. “This agreement will also put ASU on the map. ASU will be given a huge advantage in the recruitment of hockey players moving forward, because the coaching staff can draw in players who want to play at an arena where an NHL team plays. With better recruitment and a better facility, the Sun Devil hockey program can only move upward. The ASU players will also have a rare chance, from a young age, to see how professionals practice and what goes into making a professional hockey player, potentially motivating ASU s whole team. A new facility will also bring in more fans, making ASU a hotspot for hockey. This will draw in a wider age range of fans for both teams and help promote hockey as a sport on the rise in the West. There is no doubt for ASU to get into this deal. They invested in a great venue, bringing the Coyotes in, and having to upgrade that to NHL quality will make it the premier collegiate hockey venue in the country, said Todd Merkow, a sports and media instructor at theWalter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. With this deal, ASU has a chance to drive in revenue from the Coyotes and also have a consistent tenant for the multi-purpose arena. ASU has nothing to lose from this deal, and it vastly helps the school in regards to driving in money. Its hockey program will have the potential to be one of the top spots for hockey recruits from all over the world. ASU has the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a program-defining move to benefit its hockey program and school by completing the agreement with the NHL and the Arizona Coyotes.

stanforddaily_2022_102,"We are thrilled to announce that, thanks to a generous gift from the family of alumna Mary Ellen Shelton Brucker ’47, The Daily is setting up an endowment to permanently support our Opportunity Fellowship program. The gift will allow The Daily to support 15 aspiring journalists each year with a fellowship. The Opportunity Fellowship currently supports students on financial aid who want to contribute to The Daily but face financial obstacles to doing so. The monetary award provided by the fellowship replaces the need of a student to take paid work that would make The Daily inaccessible to them, thereby creating pathways for more students with financial need to contribute to The Daily. The Daily has a student staff of over 300 students spanning 14+ cross-functional teams including news reporting, photography, graphic design, software engineering and more. The degree of participation varies widely across our staff — for some students, working at The Daily is akin to a full-time job; others may contribute just an occasional article each year. However, some students cannot participate — and others cannot participate as much as they would like — because of work commitments necessary to sustain the expense of studying at Stanford. Launched in 2021, annual fundraising for the Opportunity Fellowship helped support 10 students in Spring 2021 and 15 students in Fall 2021, and, with the support of the endowment, is able to provide fellowships for 15 more students in 2022. Dozens of famed journalists and industry leaders at renowned journalistic institutions likeThe New York Times,The Washington PostandThe Atlanticgot their start in our newsroom. The Mary Ellen Brucker Opportunity Fellowships provide support for an additional 15 aspiring journalists each year, helping each one of them kick off their careers in the field. Our goal is to eventually be able to offer fellowships to all fellowship applicants. To donate and offer more students a chance to get involved with The Daily, you can visitthis linkto learn more. Here’s more about the life and memory of Mary Ellen Shelton Brucker: Mary Ellen was an active and beloved member of The Daily’s staff during her time at Stanford. From 1943-1947, Mary Ellen, who majored in communication, made her mark in the newsroom. According to her children, Ed and Katherine, Mary Ellen often reminisced about her time at The Daily, where she not only honed a love of journalism but also made long-lasting social connections. “She went out for the Big Game every year when Stanford played at home and always went to The Daily reunions,” Katherine said. “She was more excited about The Daily’s reunions than I think she was about the Big Game.” According to Ed, Mary Ellen even kept a book full of Daily front-pages that she collected during her time on the staff. He described his mother as an honest, genuine and forward-thinking woman whose journalistic passion guided her far beyond Stanford. Shortly after graduation, Mary Ellen moved to Stamford, Conn., where she worked for a local newspaper. From there, she joined international news and broadcast network Voice of America (VoA , moving to Washington, D.C. and working on VoA’s Korea, China and Hungary desks. There, Mary Ellen’s stories were translated and broadcast across the globe. Mary Ellen and her husband, Eugene Brucker Jr., were united by their love of travel. The two met onboard a ship to a youth hostel rally in Germany in 1959. “She was all about discovery and enjoying life,” Katherine said of her mother. Mary Ellen and Eugene were active members of the St. Louis Camera Club. Together, they traveled from their home in St. Louis, Mo. to international destinations late into their lives, often creating travelogues about their journeys which won several international prizes. “What really made these things quite frankly was my mother’s ability to draft a script and tell a story, and that absolutely feeds back to her time on The Daily and her skill as a writer and a storyteller,” Katherine said. Katherine characterized her mother as optimistic and motivated, pointing out that Mary Ellen pursued college and a professional career at a time in which women rarely did so. All the way through, Ed said, she remained a cherished friend — especially to those with whom she made strong connections at The Daily. “The real beauty of the story is they had great times, and they stayed together, and it was all through The Daily,” he said. As for the establishment of the Mary Ellen Brucker Opportunity Fellowships, Ed and Katherine said they are proud that their mother’s legacy will carry on while making an impact at an organization she treasured. “It’s nice that there is going to be something in her name that is going to live on,” Ed said.

Atsér is passionate about the role of stories in the authentic visualization of Africans and works through his writing to explore the nuances of the African condition. Our eyes were useless, open or closed, it didn’t make a difference. Enveloped in a darkness so thick, our tongues were bitter. We trudged along, stumbling over stumps and bumping into each other. The night was endless, so it seemed. We cried out to the heavens, “Deliver us from this cruelty.” Heaven responded. Clouds began to form, thunder clapped, lightning struck. The darkness was gone, but only for a time. It returned with a great vengeance, the cold rain. Despised by the elements, we realized that our only means of survival was each other. With arms locked together, we trekked the mean-spirited road. Stumbling less, bumping less, we trudged along with renewed hope. The hope that the night wasn’t going to last forever The hope that the sun was just on the horizon. Together, we trudged along. It was an unusually cold September morning. The harmattan season wasn’t due for three months yet the winds blew with great voracity. From the window of the bus, Délé could see plastic bags and sheets of paper dancing non-rhythmically without cause for embarrassment. As he sat on the bus with his bag on his lap and his arms wrapped tightly around his bag, he remembered the dramatic scene that had played out before he left home. Mummy had given permission to her tear glands to flood her cheeks. His three sisters did the same. Daddy was not so permissive. It seemed like he had declared an executive order to his senses that they show no emotion whatsoever. But as all laws are broken, his tear gland rebelled, sending a single tear sliding down his left cheek. He should have known better. Délé dug through his bag and pulled out his letter of offer from this big company in the big city. The words “Manager” and “Congratulations” jumped at him. He was in disbelief for two reasons: First, he was yet to come to terms with the fact that a small town kid like him with just a secondary school certificate was going to be managing a big company. Second, that a couple of words on some low-quality paper was the catalyst to his life-changing decision. To him, those words had provided him with comfort, an armour with which he was going to conquer the World. Indeed, his heart bled that his decision had caused so much hurt to his family, and he was aware that he was sailing into the unknown. However, those words on that neatly folded (albeit low-quality paper was the soothing balm to his distressed heart. To him, they meant he’d be alright. **************************************************** Délé’s first day on the job was uneventful. At the reception office, there weren’t enough seats. So, he stood. And in standing, he remained for hours that seemed to last an eternity. He didn’t mind it though. He was simply elated to be there. Eventually, he was brought in to see HR. In the congested office, there were boxes stacked up against the wall. Boxes, he imagined, that must have been there since the beginning of time, because of the stench that came from them. HR informed him that there was a mistake with his employment offer. He hadn’t been hired as a Manager but rather as a Clerk. For a moment, Délé’s world stood still. He could feel his heart racing faster than an Olympic runner. Beads of sweat began assembling on his forehead. He wished to stay calm but his body was betraying him. “We offer a path to career advancement. In a short amount of time, you can move up the ladder and become a manager,” said HR. Again, words seemed to provide him some comfort. And indeed for a time, they did. Two years later, he was still down the hall in the clerk’s office. He did everything he thought he could to climb up this proverbial ladder — but like a pendulum, every time he swung in the direction of progress, he would swing back in the opposite direction. Now, it was going on five years and he was still down the hall in the clerk’s office. He was team leader, though. Not where he wanted to be, but a mirage of progress. So he remained. **************************************************** Délé met Amaka six months after he moved to the big city. She was dark-skinned, curvy and tall. She seemed to constantly wear a smile that shone brighter than the sun. She exuded confidence when she walked. Real confidence, not weakness masked by aggression. What captivated Délé when he first met her was her intense focus. Amaka didn’t move around with the aimlessness that clung to people’s feet. Délé was sweet, thoughtful and had a good heart. That was all he had going for him, but that was enough for her. They fell in love as soon as they met. He was introverted, she was extroverted. He was short, she was tall. She was dark-skinned, he was light-skinned. He was Yoruba, she was Ibo. They were a beautiful mash of differences ordained to be together by the divine. Or so they thought. Two years after they’d been together, Amaka ran into Éméka, an old classmate who also happened to be her ex-boyfriend. Éméka had a manner about him, like he was born to rule the world — and rule the world he did. He was dark-skinned, tall, built like a Greek god, If said god was blessed with Melanin. He was confident, focused and suave. He mirrored Amaka. He was everything that Délé wasn’t. Initially, Amaka started hanging out with Éméka just to catch up on old times. But like a lit match brought near gasoline, a fire was ignited that she couldn’t put out and most importantly, wasn’t sure she wanted put out. She was cheating on Délé and he knew it. She knew that he knew but they never spoke of it. It was the proverbial 800-pound elephant in the room that wasn’t worth acknowledging. He wasn’t happy with the situation, but it was better than being alone. So, he remained. **************************************************** He remained. He was unhappy, yet he remained. He had become comfortable with his discomfort and it became his new normal. He had made some progress, however fleeting, but it was something. Indeed, this false sense of progress had blinded him. He feared that moving on was an admittance of failure that he couldn’t accept. Moving on was to mean that he was going from ‘something’ to ‘nothing,’ going back to square one, as Nigerians would say. And that thought was frightening enough that he remained. He settled! Black Voices at UBCis an open-form column publishing work by Black writers in UBC’s student community.

wildcat_arizona_2022_67,"A view of Likins Residence Hall located on Highland Avenue on April 7, 2017. The popular dorm was built in 2011 with extra sustainability features. We have all heard of both roommate horror stories and roommates that were eventually in the other’s wedding. Many people are somewhere in between, being friends with their roommate and going out together. Either way, your roommate is one of the first people you meet when you get to campus, and they can make or break your dorm/apartment experience. There are so manyarticlesabout how to become friends with your roommate and so manymoviesabout roommates being best friends. Still, it is not always a reality for university students. One of the things I was looking forward to the most my first year was meeting my roommate and experiencing the campus together. However, we did not instantly click, and we both fell into our own groups. We don’t do many things together, but we don’t avoid each other like the plague either. Talking to some of my friends made me realize that most of them are best friends with their roommates and do everything together, which initially made me think that it was not normal to not be friends with my roommate. But now I have learned it is normal not to be best friends with your roommate. With the University of Arizona campus being as big as it is, it is super easy to find friends. There are so many events in the first month of the semester and over600clubs that students can join. Classes are also a great way to meet people with the same interests as you. Yes, a lot of time will be spent with your roommate, but there are many other ways to meet people. With many students choosing to room with someone random when they register for university, it is difficult to see if you get along with them without knowing them well. Most universities try to pair similar-minded people when assigning roommates, but it does not always work out. On the other hand, some choose to live with their best friend from high school and living with someone can strain any relationship, even with your best friend. Living with someone you do not consider your best friend comes with advantages; it is easier to have tough conversations with them, like not cleaning up, because you will not be losing a friend over cleaning arguments. Another advantage is that being with your roommate can come as a break from the friends that you already hang out with. There are certain points when our social batteries run out, and we cannot handle being with our friends, so being with your roommate offers a rest from friends. Yes, there may be advantages to living with your best friend, but you do not have to do so to enjoy your college experience.

crimson_2022_59,"Conservatives and other staunch deniers of white supremacy often claim that if Nigerian immigrants in the United States are doing so well, then discrimination and white privilege cannot really exist. They then call African Americans lazy, criticising a supposed lack of values. There is some truth to the success of Nigerian Americans and other recent African immigrants in the U.S. Roughly73 percent of African immigrants16 and over are employed or seeking employment, versus the approximate 63 percent of the U.S. born population. Nigerian Americans are also one of the most affluent immigrant groups in the country, with amedian household income around $62,400, compared to the national median of roughly $57,600 in 2015. But these numbers don’t tell the whole picture; they extremely oversimplify each group and overlook context. After all, you cannot compare the “best” of one country to a broader group of citizens in another. Many Nigerian immigrants set down roots in the U.S. in the 1970s, when the Nigerian government sponsored students to study at top universities in the United Kingdom and the U.S. For decades, the American government has prefered giving visas to those deemed useful. My parents brought my family to the U.S. via a diversity visa that requires applicants to either complete high school (in a country whose secondary school completion rate was more than 47 percent in 2010 or have two years of “qualifying work experience” (again, in an economic context wherealmost one-thirdof the population is currently unemployed . Still, immigrants can come to the U.S. without much financial security. But African Americans with ancestral ties to slavery carry with them the disadvantage of being systematically denied the opportunity to accrue wealth. The intertwined effects of slavery, Jim Crow, and now mass incarceration continue to be felt today in the vicious cycle of wealth inequality.A long history of employment discriminationleads to higher unemployment rates and jobs that pay less. African Americans are less likely to be homeowners today because of historical mortgage discrimination and redlining. While African immigrants can, and certainly do, experience discrimination that harms them financially, there are advantages that come with “starting fresh” and being perceived as a model minority. African Americans are not less qualified or lazier than African immigrants — that should go without saying. Both groups are simply targeted by unfair, limited (and limiting narratives, compared to each other only on the basis of skin colour, when there is so much more at play. All the animosity between these groups is unnecessary — they need not be in opposition in the first place. While many such comparisons come from outsiders, it is disappointing that members of the Black diasporahave allowedsuch division. Too many Africans living in the U.S., especially those who came here as adults, dismiss Generational African Americans as lacking drive, without considering what life and history has been like from their perspective. And too many Black people growing up in the U.S. are xenophobic, holding backwards and limited ideas of what life is like in Africa. We’ve fallen victim to white supremacy’s trap of keeping us engaged with fighting rather than expending our energy productively. Maybe neither group is willfully ignorant, but we all hold a responsibility to seek out the truth regarding life experiences we are not aware of. I don’t want Black people to bond solely over trauma, but being deeply affected by white supremacy, whether by colonisation or slavery, should make us realise that we are truly not each other’s enemy. Especially because both groups have so much in common. Strong family values are foundational in all parts of the Black diaspora; so is the creative, joyful energy that I see as a fundamental part of the Black experience. Both groups carry a tenacious, hardworking spirit and a deep respect for culture. There are even shared jokes — like being late all the time — that ring true in almost every part of the diaspora. This Black History Month, let’s look at our family in all parts of the world, across the ocean or within our city. Let’s understand each other instead of letting white America and the limited room it allows for different perspectives keep us apart. Of course, all members of the Black diaspora are distinct. But it’s frustrating seeing division among a group that, united, could show the world what Black excellence really means. As long as we are setting ourselves up against each other, none of us win.

stanforddaily_2022_72,"Zohar Levy ’22 is a senior studying Linguistics and Modern Languages. She served as co-president of Stanford’s Jewish Student Association. After my family sought a safe haven in the United States following World War II, I’ve often wondered why the country of my birthplace didn’t act sooner. Why didn’t the U.S.destroyNazi railroadsthatshipped millions of Jews and othersacross continental Europe to their horrific deaths during the Holocaust? I’ve wondered how Western leaders could have possibly let Hitler get away with hateful and absurd ideologies for years. Today, I’m wondering why the U.S. isn’t stopping Vladimir Putin’s path toward an unimaginable annihilation of Ukraine, Europe and the West as we know it. From behind our American TV screens and online newspapers, Putin’s so-called “special military operation” of Ukraine seemed impossible to imagine. Up until the moment when Russian troops and missiles crossed the border on February 24, 2022, citizens in the U.S. and in European allied-countries denied the plausibility that Putin could be this illogical and aggressive. The U.S. government released intelligence and a public information campaign rightlyforecasting the invasionbut has been criticized for miscalculating aquick Russian winand for notacting earlier(for example, by sending weapons in advance or encouraging the mobilization of Ukrainian troops . These naïve assumptions about tragedies in Europe are not new to the Western mindset. For as long as I can remember, I’ve studied the history of the Holocaust. As the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor from Vienna, I have listened to hundreds of survivor stories, visited monuments and museums, worked at the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust,conducted researchabout the migration of Jews escaping Europe and in many ways let the histories and values of Jewish survival and flourishing shape my life. While the methods, ideologies and structures employed by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in the 1930s and 1940s are unlike the current invasion of Ukraine, I can’t help but see similarities emerge. Putin has taken tips from Hitler’s playbook. Much like Hitler’s insistence that his 1938 invasion of Czechoslovakiareunited ethnic Germans in the Sudetenlandwith their German compatriots,Putin claims to defend ethnic Russiansfrom Ukraine’s persecution. Then and now, Hitler and Putin’s romanticizing and reclaiming of past nationalistic empires cloak their disregard for other countries’ right to their national autonomy. The unacceptably weak acquiescence of the West toward Nazi Germany rings eerily similar to the lack of substantive response to Putin’s campaign against Ukraine today. Before February 24, the thought of a military campaign for the “demilitarization and denazification” of Ukraine seemed insane. Now it is real. War has once again taken over Europe. Pictures of slaughtered Ukrainian men, women and children have been flashing behind my eyelids for two months now. Putin has decimated countless communities, families and lives. The damage is far from over. The threat to democracy, to autonomy, to human rights, to peace, to global stability, is imminent. The graphic and painful images of Ukrainian bodies, crumpled and lifeless in the streets, have been headlining the front pages of newspapers and prime-time television. As of April 6, over10 million people, 25% of Ukraine’spre-war population of 44 million, have been forced to leave their homes. Another12 million“are thought to be stranded or unable to leave areas affected by the fighting.” We are hearing breaking reports of massacres and mass graves, threats of chemical and nuclear weapons,missile strikes of civilian areasandwidespread rape and sexual violence. It’s time to listen. Russian tactics and violence today are not so different from the initial invasions of Nazi Germany. And much like its isolationist strategy in the 1940s, the U.S. seems to believe that Putin’s war isn’t a direct attack on American democracy, or that the invasion of Ukraine isn’t already a World War. Like before, the U.S. is being naïve by primarily pursuing diplomatic solutions and sending weapons abroad. Victor Pinchuk illustrates the problem simply in his op-ed “Ukraine Needs More Than Sympathy From the West to Beat Russia.” While the West concerns itself with ethical ways to contain the war, “Russia abides by no such restraints, using mass deception, false-flag attacks, forbidden arms, mercenaries and terrorists.” Hitler clearly did not play by the same code of Western ethics, either. I want to make it clear that I do not wish to compromise on the crucial values of the free world in order to fight Putin’s immorality and lawlessness. This consideration of democratic and ethical values is exactly what sets the U.S. and her allies apart from Russian autocratic rule. With that being said, supplying weapons and aid to Ukraine, even alongside crippling sanctions on Russia and calls for a cease-fire, is not enough. Putin has proved that he doesn’t care about the sanctions devastating the Russian economy and society. His army is bombing hospitals, train stations, schools and community centers. The Mariupol hospital airstrike of March 9 targeted a maternity ward, and many othermedical centers have been bombedsince. Later that month in Mariupol, Putinshelled an art schoolsheltering 400 Ukrainian civilians. Even if we terribly misjudge and overestimate the capabilities of the Russian Air Force, it is very unlikely that these strikes against defenseless civilians were a misfire. These facts indicate that we are beyond diplomacy and conflict mediation. With little knowledge of what might come next, I turn back to history. I haven’t forgotten that U.S. involvement helped liberate Europe from the clutches of Nazi Germany. In many ways, the stakes for the West to act this time are even higher. We cannot ignore the egregious crimes happening right in front of our eyes. With the democratization of news through social media and the internet, we are watching the bombings and the murderslive.Nuclear weaponsare no longer a theoretical Manhattan Project and could very well beused at any time. I do not have a policy or military solution, nor do I have an outline of how to bring about peace and carry out justice. Even so, there is a pressing moral compulsion to take more action against these war crimes. I am not advocating for a declaration of war — indeed, war with Putin’s Russia would have tremendous consequences, including even greater loss of life and a possible global nuclear war. Is there a way toforfeit Russia’s seatas apermanent member of the United Nations Security Council? What about cultural and diplomatic boycotts? Could we embolden other nation-state actors such asChina or Indiato persuade Putin to stand down? I want to trust that the West is truly doing everything it can to help victims of Putin’s evil. There must be more that we can do. Putinmay not be winningon the battlefield. But hisclaim that “everything is going to plan” may not be incorrect. His actions in Ukraine have already proven a victory in undermining the values of the West, such as “the entire concept of international law.” At the same time, Putin has unintentionally and perversely reminded the West about what rights topeace, dignity, autonomy and justicemean, and how we have to actively protect these democratic values. We in the West should be more disturbed and unsettled by this repetition of history. How many more people slaughtered, families shattered, women raped, children orphaned, cities leveled, Ukrainian leaders kidnapped, graves filled and human rights violated before we act? At what number of displaced people and refugees will we sayenough? What more needs to happen to Ukraine and its people?
